3,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,J.K. Rowling,4.44,4911929,77741,Lora,5,"I'm going to keep this brief since there isn't much to say that hasn't already been said. *clears throat*I think the reason I waited so long to read this series is because I just couldn't imagine myself enjoying reading about an eleven-year-old boy and his adventures at a school of wizardry. I thought it would be too juvenile for my taste. I was wrong, of course.I can honestly say that I loved every minute of this. It's a spectacular little romp with funny, courageous, and endearing characters that you can't help but love.It has talking chess pieces, singing hats, a giant three-headed dog named Fluffy, a hilarious giant with a dragon fetish, a master wizard that's just a little bit crazy, mail carrier owls, goblins running a bank, unicorns, centaurs(!), trolls . . . and probably much more that I'm forgetting. And then there's the lead characters: Hermione, the young scholar who starts out prim and up-tight but soon becomes a true friend; Ron, the boy who has little money but who has an abundance of family and loyalty to his friends to make up for it; and then there's Harry, the boy who starts out sleeping in a closet and ends up being a hero. Harry is kind to those that deserve it, fearless when it counts the most, and wonderfully intelligent. What's not to love? In regards to the ending: (view spoiler)[I feel silly saying this about a middle grade novel, but I didn't suspect Quirrell a bit! If there were hints that he was the true culprit and not Snape, I obviously missed them. (hide spoiler)]FAVORITE QUOTE: ""But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.""Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to start Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.*******************************************************My reviews of other titles in this series:Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"
1,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Harry Potter, #6)",J.K. Rowling,4.54,1810404,28053,Cait (Paper Fury),5,"""Read Harry Potter!"" they said. ""It'll be fun!"" they said. ""Our childhood was built on Harry Potter!"" they said.WELL YOUR CHILDHOODS WERE ALL HORRIBLE. OMG WHAT IS THIS BOOK? WHAT IS THIS MESS I'M IN?? Excuse me, but that large salty lake where my life used to be is my tears. Yes, yes, this means I loved it. But SERIOUSLY. Nooooot okay. At the end there, especially, I couldn't put the audio down so I was wandering about my house in a blind daze listening instead.And because every human and their fluffy poodle has probably sensibly reviewed this book, BAH. I'm just going to make a list of things I loved and things I didn't. My Intense And Passionate LOVES:• Harry + Ginny = yes. I was dubious at first. Like I think romance is NOT JKR's strong point...plus when she gets to a romantic scene she ends the chapter. HHAHAH. ADORABLE. (Not that I minded, I just...I think she's not good at romance.) But omg, there was that moment after the Quidditch match??? YUP. You know what I'm talking about. Excuse me, my heart just ran around in circles screaming and shipping.• Hermione: I adore her, but...I gotta admit, she was a little bit too stuffy. BUT I STILL LOVE HER. I love her love for learning.• I also adore how sensible Ginny is. • Fred and George's joke shop gives life. Also death, probs, but liiiiife.• I am utterly in LOVE with the whole concept of Hogwarts. I mean, I think it's stupid that they have to write with a quill and ink (can't they just enchant the quill to write for them?) and they seem to get an excessive amount of homework, BUT. It's all so vivid and detailed and it literally feels like Hogwarts is A REAL PLACE. I totally get why people wail about their letters going missing. • Speaking of detail...me likey. I always felt inside the story.• Plus the audio book (narrated by Jim Dale) is GREAT. I totally recommend it. I think Hermione's voice had a tendency to sound like an insufferable goat, but I got used to it. Harry's voice was perfection. • I also particularly liked Harry in this book. I JUST LOVE HARRY. <3 He's snarky, but he's lost some of the angriness from bk 5. He's got snarky quips at the ready, but he's also intensely...good. Like he's just a really GOOD chap, who makes bad decisions but really means well. ZOMG. *flails about* He was definitely my favourite character in this book. • ALSO DUMBLEDORE WAS GREAT. I love Dumbledore and how he's always polite and kind and smiley. (view spoiler)[ CAN WE TALK A MINUT EHOW I'M NOT OKAY THAT HE'S DEAD?!??!?!? LIKE WHAT EVEN THE FLYING HECK OF BROOMS NEST TAILS. THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. BUT IT SHOULDN'T. BECAUSE NOTHING MAKES SENSE. Dumbledore. no. Come baaaaaaaack. *breaks down into a mess* I am also intensely furious that his weakening himself to get the horcrux was useless. MAD. Okay? I AM MAD. Character deaths where they failed are the worst there are.  (hide spoiler)]My Intense and Passionate LOATHES:(Hhahahha...you ready for this?)• Okay so, question: WHY do they sometimes go places and buy food...and sometimes they just magic it? Like Mrs. Weasely magics onion soup out of nothing for Harry. But in the next chapter, Harry and Ron are peeling sprouts. LIKE WUT. This makes no sense to me. • Why didn't Dumbledore pour the evil potion on the ground instead of drinking it? Just wannna know...• How the FLYING FRIKKIN BROOMSTICKS can anyone possibly convince me Snape is still on the good side? Because I don't even care. He can go abra kadabra himself to Timbuktu and DIE THERE THANKS. There is no repentance after this. I don't even care what the ""reason"" is in book 7, but Harry: you are an idiot to name your kid after Snape. • I HOPE SNAPE DIES.• DID I MENTION MY HATE FOR SNAPE YET???????• Oh and another thing...I am so angry at Snape arghhhqqwqq.• Okay. Good now. I'm calm. Thank you. • HAHHAHHAHAHTE SNAPE.• Yes, I truly am calm this time. I'm good.• So. I also am fairly annoyed about Voldermort's (Tom Riddle) backstory. Because he read like he was straight out of a psychopath text book...which I found monstrously unimaginative. Attractive, calm, subtle bully, kleptomaniac, limited emotional reach, charmer, smooth...blah blah. Yes. I can just read a book about psychopaths and that's Voldey's description. I wish there'd been a little more ingenuity in there.• I really also dislike Ron. I KNOW. Travesty. But he's a bully! He was bullying first year's the whole time...turfing tem off chairs, scaring them, bossing them around, taking stuff off them in the name of ""prefect"". Like how is that good?? How is that okay??? I will not forgive Ron for all this. And also the fact that he's a downright BRUTE to Hermione. How can I ship them when he's so rude and demeaning to her?? I DON'T. Hermione deserves better. And I don't buy the ""She completes him by sorting him out"" because I think all humans should take responsibility for their actions. Hermione shouldn't HAVE to force Ron into a better person and be his conscious. AGH. • Not shipping that. ^^• Okay, I'm done. But just *whispers* I hate hate hate Snape. So basically YES, I had a fantastic time with this book. I loved the audio. I loved the story. I loved Harry and the world just feels so big and rich and visual. I get the intense fandom for this I DO GET IT. After being so angry and 1000% done in with book 3, I can successfully say I can't WAIT to read the last book now. And then watch all the movies. And then I'll finally be caught up, omg. Only took me like 10 years."
7,"The Harry Potter Collection (Harry Potter, #1-6)",J.K. Rowling,4.73,26702,909,Jen Holman,5,"I do not own this spiffy box set of Harry Potter books, but no way was I going to sit down and input all 6 of them!! When we were in the UK on our honeymoon in the spring of 2000, Harry Potter fever was just hitting its stride there. Not long after that the books found their way to Canada and I fell in love with this series right from the first book. Again (I'm a broken record) great characters and time-old literary themes, as well as just being a very enjoyable read. I haven't gone to see the movies, because I don't want the characters in my mind replaced with British teen actors and Gary Oldman. (can't stand Gary Oldman.) Fantastic read for any age. Some of my all-time favourite literary characters are from this series, like Dumbledore and Sirius Black. The books get heavier (literally and metaphorically) as the series progresses. The first book is the most child-like, shorter and lighter fare. The last book is downright philosophical and practically qualifies as a doorstop it's so weighty. The HP series is kind of like literary comfort food around here, if there's nothing else to read we'll just grab one and dive in. A definite must-read!"
9644,Why I Write,George Orwell,4.04,5428,479,Matthias,5,"Part 56 in the ""Another autobiographical review that nobody asked for!""-series.Why I ReviewIt was already very late in my boyhood, at thirty years old, when I considered writing book reviews. Being the man of action that I am, which is to say a lazy bum, it was almost to my own surprise that this innocent consideration promptly turned itself into virulent spasms across the keyboard, with my first contributions on Goodreads as the very unfortunate result. Thankfully my friends list at the time only consisted of some imported Facebook contacts who had last been active 5 years prior to my sudden burst of literary enthusiasm and who had gotten too busy climbing up corporate ladders to even remember ever having registered to a website about books, let alone notice what I was doing. Maybe it was this anonymity that allowed me to stay here, because as my own ineptitude was gradually becoming clearer to me as I was reading through others' reviews, I still persisted in forcing myself upon this community and fiendishly sent out friend requests in hopes of learning but mainly in hopes of belonging in this hall of learned ladies and gentlemen. I didn't stop to ponder on these hopes, on my true intentions, my real motivations. I just went with that ""big bang"" moment that seemed to come out of nowhere and I took it from there. I never stopped to ask: Why? George Orwell and his essay on why he writes made me revisit those early days of reviewing and the months (years?) that have transpired since then. I found his considerations relevant to why I am doing what I do, and the structure he employed quite helpful for the organisation of my own scrambled thoughts. Also, it's a very good essay and I rated it five stars, in case you were here for just the review. If you find yourself even remotely interested in reading further through my recollections then I can wholeheartedly recommend George Orwell's original text. Employing Orwell's essay structure, I should start with an understanding of my true nature and with a return to my childhood. Many of you already know that I was a happy, skinny, bespectacled and introverted child with no brothers or sisters and with a wonderful dog. I will not elaborate on that childhood too much since I already did that in other reviews, but these traits do explain a tendency to keep busy with solitary activities. As a child or teenager these activities strangely enough barely entailed reading or writing, aside from comic books and what was required for school. I found reading to be very boring. It felt like watching a movie with subtitles, only without the movie, and much slower. And with the advent of video games I truly had everything my solitary heart desired. The few books I had at that time turned yellow, collected dust and eventually got sold for twenty francs. Fast forward to the internet, with its chat rooms and forums devoted to games and the dominance of the English language in those settings. At a certain point I spent more time on the Internet discussing game strategies rather than playing the games themselves, as I also started commenting on the personal stories and the societal comments people invariably shared on these things. It is now, also through remembering some emails and letters I sent, I realise that it was mainly the writing in itself that I enjoyed, especially in English. All I needed was something worthwhile to write about. Another fast forward to much later to when I finally started reading, also in English. Murakami's ""The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle"" proved to be the perfect present and as I read and finished that one I couldn't wait to start another book and then another and then another. Forget about slow. Forget about ""where are the pictures?"". Finally the movies I always wanted were playing in my mind as I sped through the pages. But after a couple of books a sad realisation gripped me as I asked myself: ""What was the Murakami book about again? Something about a well and melanoma?"". Clearly I had forgotten. I've always been someone who got through life more on the basis of an understanding in the moment rather than a remembering of the past. There are a lot of things to be said for traveling light and taking nothing with you on your travels, but I figured I preferred to try and collect some souvenirs at least. Hence the idea to write reviews. So that's the narrative. But Orwell also comes up with a list of motives, especially when it comes to writing in order to be read, which clearly apply to my case:Sheer egoism""The desire to seem clever.""Check! The immediate feedback-system on Goodreads coupled with its exceedingly generous community makes this motive a potentially overpowering one.Aesthetic enthusiasm""The desire to share an experience which one feels is valuable and ought not to be missed.""Check! Hope you got John McNee's books in your libraries! I think I stressed that enough by now. In the case of reviewing it can also be the opposite of aesthetic enthusiasm, for cases where you would like to dissuade people from ever getting near a certain book. Having seen some negative reviews, those can be pretty enthusiastic as well. Historical impulse""The desire to see things as they are, to find out true facts and store them up for use of posterity.""On the one hand I can't say Check! here because I'm dealing in opinions rather than facts, but on the other hand, as is the case with ""classics"", some general opinions turn into facts and it's nice to either try and debunk them or wholeheartedly defend their status. In essence to see for yourself what all the fuss is about and reach your own conclusions. Moreover the discussions on books and society that often ensue on this website are often very enriching to me and teach me in much the same way a history teacher would, so what the hell: Check!Political purpose""The desire to push the world in a certain direction, to alter people's idea of the kind of society they should strive after.""Dump Trump!, uhh, I mean Check!So there we have it. A ""why"" that has been answered, if not fully, at least partially. A reason for writing that Orwell shortly touched upon as well is ""for a living"". But I think only very few here get compensation in financial terms, not counting gifted books in return for reviews. Unless you guys know something that I don't. In any case, in the end the most important reason lies in the amalgam of all those reasons enumerated above, an amalgam that I can only describe as: I love being here.Just kidding, that's not a reason, that's circular reasoning. But I almost made you tear up, didn't I? It's true though. I do!"
3732,Selected Poems of Herman Melville,Herman Melville,3.9,40,4,Keith,3,"Herman Melville’s poetry is an enigma. The man wrote poetry when he wrote prose. Passages from Moby Dick can be easily laid out in iambic pentameter, with the rich rhythms and imagery you’d expect from a great poet. Yet his poetry proves something else – a bit stiff, slavish to the meter, with cloying rhymes. His mistake, it seems to me, is trying to take his epic, sprawling style and fit it in a tight, lyric format. The short lined lyric doesn’t do him justice, and I don’t think he wrote anything in blank verse – which you would think would be is forte. That said, he wrote some fine poems – the John Marr collection being his best in my opinion. This edition, collected and introduced by Robert Penn Warren, offers an excellent sample of Melville’s poetry, covering poems from his entire life. Warren’s introduction offers one of the best, most comprehensive overviews of Melville’s poetry that you’ll find outside some obscure literary magazine. If you’re interested in Melville and/or his poetry, this is a great starting point.Battle-Pieces *** -- I found this to be a rather strange work. It doesn’t have the vitality or sweep of Whitman’s Drum Taps. Melville struggles to understand the Civil War and its carnage, but his language and ideas seem trapped in metric forms and rhymes. (1/12)Clarel ** – This is a difficult, rambling poem to read and understand. The form cramps Melville’s sprawling style, and the rigid meter is difficult, requiring someone of more skill than Melville (or most writers) possess. (1/12)John Marr and Other Sailors **** – This brief collection is outstanding. Here, Melville adopts a longer line – rhyming but not metrically rigid – that gives him the freedom and space he needs to express himself. The “Sailor Poems” that start the collection are particularly good, though they all have the same story/theme: An old man looking back on his sailing life. Billy Budd probably started as part of this collection, but took on a life of its own and Melville began working on it separately. If anyone is interested in Melville poetry, I’d suggest starting here. (1/12)"
3731,Great Short Works of Herman Melville,Herman Melville,4.05,463,19,James,5,"In the spring of 1853 after the failure of his novel Pierre: Or the Ambiguities and the rejection of his most recent manuscript, The Isle of the Cross (now lost), Herman Melville submitted three stories to Harper's. This was the beginning of period that would see the publication of such great stories as ""Bartley, the Scrivener"", ""Benito Cereno"", ""The Piazza"", and others. It would culminate with his great unfinished novella, Billy Budd, Sailor. All of Melville's tales including Billy Budd are included in this collection from Harper's Perennial Library.By the end of 1853 Melville submits his first story that can be considered not only great but even amazing; this is Bartleby, the Scrivener: A Story of Wall Street. The story amazes in many ways and on many levels. One theme is a world of walls as the narrator, an ""unambitious"" lawyer who prefers the peace of his office to the bustle of the courtroom with judge and jury. He describes himself as ""an eminently safe man"", certainly someone who his clients can trust. The world of his office, located on Wall Street, is one of walls within, separating the scriveners from the lawyer, and walls without since the view from the few windows is limited by the proximity of the walls of the building next door.Into his apparently prosperous business enters Bartleby, a scrivener or clerk, who is hired to handle some additional copying work. Bartleby, as we soon learn, would ""prefer not"" to do any task other than copying and before too long he seems to slowly stop doing any work. He is a ""forlorn"" and sickly character from the beginning (reminiscent of the copyist ""Nemo"", a minor character in Dickens' Bleak House). And his presence gradually requires the narrator to attempt, unsuccessfully, to provoke him so that he might respond in kind. Their worlds clash and in another deeper sense a spiritual realm is entered. The result is a crisis of faith for the lawyer, he thought to himself: ""I might give alms to his body; but his body did not pain him; it was his soul that suffered, and his soul I could not reach."" (p 56)One may interpret Bartleby as a ""Christ-like"" messenger, but what is his message? The variety of themes in the story takes on an objective pathos and parabolic overtones that are almost Dostoievskian in complexity. The story ends with a sort of epilogue that succeeds only in muddying the message further. What makes the story so magnificent is all of the many different possibilities present in it. Just as the narrator has his faith shaken and his perceptions changed by Bartleby, the reader finds his imagination roiled by the possibilities -- the ending merely lays out a choice for the reader. You decide what it all means."
3733,"Redburn, White-Jacket, Moby-Dick",Herman Melville,4.18,942,68,Ken,5,"I'm speechless. OK, maybe a few words. At first I gave this book four stars, but then I looked at other books I'd given five stars to and said, ""Who am I kidding? No way is that in a league with the Whale."" I wanted to chip a star for some of the excess, the stuffed in chapters, the lengthy and in some cases unnecessary asides, but then I slept on it (ouch) and decided I'm using my 21st-century prejudices against a guy operating in the 19th century and that's just not fair.What's to like here is some poetry-studded narrative. Lots of it. And Biblical slash Shakespearean moments galore. The sea is to Capt. Ahab as the heath is to King Lear. And, in the dramatic ending, more than once I heard Ahab addressed as ""Oh Captain, my captain!"" which made me wonder if this preceded Whitman or not. I'm guessing or not and that it's a nod to Walt.I learned a lot about whaling, not much of it pleasant. But it was a great way to deliver information. And I loved all the little extras, the hints of mystery, like how dying whales, tethered to the ship, will turn to the sun and then, when they die, drift so their noses face the opposite direction. It's as if they are beautiful pagans like Queequeg, not facing Mecca but a more primal source, the god of fire. And Melville sees the irony in it, too -- the king of dark, watery vaults worshiping the great hearth of airy fire. Yeah. You can't just make stuff like that up. You've got to pause your reading, reread it, and say, ""Wow"" (or whatever they say in your neck of the woods).Melville is, if nothing else, versatile. He can write an action scene. He can bring to life with a few words a wide array of characters. And he can philosophize in a leviathan way. Big. Yes, I think he was rooting for the Whale, but a part of him loved Ahab, too. A part of him was amazed not just at the hubris but at the dogged determination and blind courage man is capable of. All in all, I'm glad I darned that hole in my reading résumé. Now I can die, meaning this is the literary equivalent of seeing Naples. :-)"
7056,Morality For Beautiful Girls (No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency),Alexander McCall Smith,3.97,32747,1544,Anne Hawn Smith,5,"Reading these books is more like visiting with friends. If you are looking for action and plot, this will not really appeal to you, especially if you have read some of the others. These books are more of a slice of life.This was one of my favorites because of the depression that overcomes Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni. It comes over him so gradually and the people who love him are so concerned for him. I could almost feel myself becoming concerned for him also. Since I suffer from depression from time to time (not just the blues) I found the characterization very good. It's hard to portray how abnormal a person's thinking becomes and Smith does a great job. It's easy to stand on the outside and tell the depressed person to get out and visit friends, but the sick person feels that no one would like to be around him and that he is a burden to his friends; he thinks they would all sigh with relief if he got out of their lives.And that brings up another thing I like about these books. The people are not perfect. They are a combination of the good and the bad and they all struggle to get along in the best way possible. They don't just walk away from each other either."

7058,"The Good Husband of Zebra Drive (No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, #8)",Alexander McCall Smith,4.06,20396,1082,Donna,5,"After quite a few years of living it, I've come to the conclusion that life is made of two things: time and attention. What I love about the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series is the way the author, Alexander McCall Smith, handles both.In The Good Husband of Zebra Drive, as in all the books in the series, the pace is lazy and relaxed. If I ever visit that part of Africa, I expect that I'll recognize the way the sun feels there, the way the dust settles on the roads after a car goes by. The umbrella-like trees and the dignified, enduring cattle will seem familiar. Mma Ramotswe, the central character, notices these things, and I've spent many happy hours gazing at Africa through her eyes.In this book, Mma ponders the mysteries of life and concludes that it is made of big things and small things. The big things, good and bad, are writ large, impossible to ignore. So it's essential to notice and find joy in the small things: ""small acts of helping others, if one could; small ways of making one's own life better: acts of love, acts of tea, acts of laughter.""I recommend this book as a small vacation from life's big concerns. It goes well with an evening of leisure and a nice, hot cup of red bush tea."
7062,Paris to the Moon,Adam Gopnik,3.76,11702,962,Kara,5,"I have to be honest. I bought this book because I liked the title. Then I got sucked in by the back cover. Who doesn't think the idea of running away w/ your adult family to Paris wouldn't be fantastic?Gopnik is excellent at revealing the sutle differences between life in the States and France that make up two completely seperate cultures. I felt upon finishing the book that I actually knew the secrets of French thought and behavior. Unfortunately, I now know exactly why I'd never be able to blend in perfectly - my passion for sneakers would sell me out!Entwined with the journalistic entries of his five years in Paris, Gopnik fills the pages with real life and lots of romance that one hopes for in a story about Paris. And not the couplely type of romance, but the kind that makes it possible to fall in love w/ a city. If I ever get to give my two cents in a European Cities and Culture class, I would make this part of the required reading. My favorite quote from the book because it reveals how culture is prominently defined, even in toddlers:Luke, the Gopnik's 4 yr old son, who has only lived in Paris and as such is more French than American and more French than his parents, says the following to his mother upon seeing Santa buying champagne on Christmas Eve while out for last minutes holiday touches w/ his father. ""We saw Santa at Hediard. I think he was just getting a little cheap wine for the elves.""You could never get even the most precocious American child to say it quite the same way. As if they're worldy and 40 at the age of 4."
7057,"In the Company of Cheerful Ladies (No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, #6)",Alexander McCall Smith,4.07,22518,1008,Laurel,4,"There is something so comforting about this series. Even though life in Botswana is most likely very different than life in Canada, there is something about the tone or writing style that reminds me of life at my grandparent's house. I love the traditional values, the respect for people/property/manners. And most of all, I love that it is important to slow down and really be in the moment with those important to you. I know that the future installments become a little formulaic. However, every so often I am struck by how much I miss my grandparents, and reading one of these books takes the edge off. There is a little magic to these books."
7064,"The Belly of Paris (Les Rougon-Macquart, #3)",Émile Zola,3.9,3016,243,Kalliope,4,"The cover of this novel should come with a warning. Well, may be not even just a warning, for it should be sold with a calorie counter. I am afraid I may have put on several kilos while reading this. Perhaps it would be advisable to read it while running on the treadmill. The lush descriptions of succulent food could well activate and stimulate the production of a peculiar kind of literary enzymes which multiply by ten the energy provided by ingested food if it has been deliciously described.Warnings should go also for the vegetarians. Or the sections dealing with raw meat on display, black pudding, lard and all kinds of sausages, could make them feel disgusted with Zola. These ought to be marked and those who want their cholesterol (the LDL kind) somewhat high would be interested in giving it a pass. The pescetarian types could instead go direct to the Fish pavilion and read and smell the bounty piscary. Zola’s account of the fish counter has the variety and range of an oceanic aquarium. In all shapes and tints. Flesh and Fish then. If these victuals are often presented in opposition Zola exploits this by making it drive some aspects of the novel. For the plot moves along the rivalry between the Butcher and Fishmonger ladies.Other people may prefer to move ahead and read the counter on cheeses and butters over and over again. Never would I have thought that anyone would ever write such an Ode to the Cantals, Gruyères, Bries, Port-Saluts, Roqueforts, Monts-d’Or, Neufchâtels, of this world. Sumptuous and delectable. I certainly belong to that group, and if I could only put one update for this book, it would be this glorious passage. But then, I am a lacto-addict.And even if the book first pays attention to the vegetables, it may be of interest to leave that section to read at the end. I always liked the French custom of eating salad at the end of meals. I don’t know why Zola did not follow this commendable habit here. No matter, his vegetables sparkle like colourful jewels.But not everything is the food. There is history too. Although I have read a fair amount of Zola in the past, for its literary appeal, I was now drawn for its documentary value. And I have not been disappointed. This novel can be read as an intense social, economic and political document.Although published in 1873, when France had installed the Third Republic, the novel is set in the early years of the Second Empire when the population of Paris had doubled in just a few decades. This was the time of the Haussmannization of the city, and amongst other projects, the Central Market of Paris was rebuilt in a structure of glass and steel pavilions to accommodate the provisioning of the city. Balzac had already been fascinated by the logistics required for the supply of food for the daily consumption of Parisians. And Zola followed Balzac’s steps in this too. Reading his Ventre de Paris one feels the compulsion to google all kinds of data relating to Les Halles of Victor Baltard (1805-1974).But what fascinated me the most during this read was Zola’s exploration of the nature of substantiality and his blurring of the borderline separating the human from the material. In some of his descriptions there is a symbiosis between the individual and the corporeality of her/his world that goes beyond anthropomorphism. Inevitably, I had to think of Arcimboldo’s fantasies..For there is something Surreal in Zola’s Naturalism."

I haven't gone to see the movies, because I don't want the characters in my mind replaced with British teen actors and Gary Oldman. (can't stand Gary Oldman.) Fantastic read for any age. Some of my all-time favourite literary characters are from this series, like Dumbledore and Sirius Black. The books get heavier (literally and metaphorically) as the series progresses. The first book is the most child-like, shorter and lighter fare. The last book is downright philosophical and practically qualifies as a doorstop it's so weighty. The HP series is kind of like literary comfort food around here, if there's nothing else to read we'll just grab one and dive in. A definite must-read!"
515,Programming Ruby: The Pragmatic Programmers' Guide,Dave Thomas,4.06,1713,73,Manuel Menezes,5,"If you are an experienced programmer wanting to learn Ruby, this book is for you. A word of warning, though: go take a look at Chapter 27, Metaprogramming. That's the place where the object model of Ruby is explained. Without it, the rest of the book will seem to rely a bit too much on your faith. Unless, of course, you enjoy discovering the truth behind the magic for yourself. I'm sure it is possible and fun, but if you cannot spend the extra time, do take a peek at that chapter.Another warning: the book (or at least it's ebook version) has quite a few typos, especially in Part 4."
5311,The Financial Wisdom of Ebenezer Scrooge: Transforming Your Relationship with Money,Ted Klontz,3.53,60,10,Chavonne,4,"I really enjoyed this book as it interestingly married two loves of mine: financial therapy and Dickens. I think the only thing that led me to not give it a 5 was the lack of money scripts given (I think some readers would struggle with know theirs without a list to work from) as well as its dearth of actual quotes from 'A Christmas Carol'. This book uses the example of Ebenezer Scrooge to really drive home the concept of how one's beliefs (or scripts) about money can dictate their entire existence. I appreciated that this was written by authors with both financial and counseling backgrounds. It's incredibly easy to read, but gives lots of food for thought. It definitely made me look forward to reading the novel this book uses so well in the holiday season as well."
5786,"The Mystery of the Aleph: Mathematics, the Kabbalah, and the Search for Infinity",Amir D. Aczel,3.85,585,44,Roy,1,"Some of the errors in this book baffle me. They are not of the innocent kind. Some major offences:Both the continuum hypothesis and its converse are true. And both the continuum hypothesis and its converse are not true. The continuum hypothesis is undecidable within our realm of mathematics.By 'our realm of mathematics' Aczel means the ZFC theory. By 'undecidable' he means 'independent' (fair enough, apparently the two are used as synonyms in some contexts). What he means by 'converse' is not clear to me: the continuum hypothesis (CH) is an equation, not an implication. Perhaps he means negation. In any case, whatever the meaning, he's claiming both p and ~p are true. On a semantic view this is bogus. Perhaps he meant it syntactically. But that would mean ZFC is inconsistent, which does not at all follow from CH's independence of ZFC. Given any system, Gödel concluded, there will always be propositions that cannot be proven within the system.This is far too strong and sloppy. If we interpret it strictly, it's false, since inconsistent theories prove all of its sentences. If we're generous and assume Aczel means consistent theories, then it's trivial, since consistent theories do not prove some sentences by definition. So we may be generous again and assume he means that there will always be a sentence S such that both S and ~S are unprovable within some theory. But this is again not true since there exist negation complete theories.One might argue that so much detail would only confuse the layman. Fair point. But then Aczel could just have written something like: ""Gödel showed that any system strong enough to serve as the foundation of mathematics necessarily can't prove some mathematical truths"", without being so inaccurate.The completion of the theory of mathematics will have to wait until the day when more is known about the mystery of the continuum.Wut. Gödel has shown that such a completion is impossible, and you have even made a stronger claim than his result just now. And now you tell me I have to wait for a completion.Also: the mystery of the continuum. Other things I recall Azcel calling mysterious: the proof of Zorn's lemma, the axiom of choice. Other new age-ish terms Aczel seems to love: the secret of garden of the infinite, forbidden knowledge (in reference to Cantor's theories). Granted, the mathematics is definitely fascinating, mind-boggling even, but I think this characterisation is a bit tripe. The same goes for biographical details related to mental illness (both Cantor and Gödel suffered from this). Aczel loves to push the 'tormented genius' theme (Logicomix did the same) which I personally find to be in pretty bad taste.So the mathematical exposition is generally wanting. What about the Kaballah?The Kaballah is superficially explained in a single short chapter, and Aczel does not seem very knowledgeable on the subject. At some point he e.g. emphasises the mystical significance of the number ten. The reason for this, he explains, is that the sequence JHVH has ten permutations. He even proceeds to enumerate 'all' of them. The problem is that he overlooks two permutations. At that point one can only guess that he did not bother to consult any sources.At the end Aczel argues for the Platonist philosophy of mathematics. His arguments:(1) If numbers are our invention, then we would know everything about their properties and structure, which is not the case. So they must be real.(2) The effective applications of calculus are hard to explain if the continuum is not real.Both of these arguments are weak. (1) seems plain false: just consider the design of a legal document or a rule-based game. As for (2), models don't need to be describe reality in order to be effective. Newtonian physics is still useful for engineers for example. Apart from these arguments, there are popular alternatives to Platonism (constructivism, for one) but Aczel does not even discuss them. In conclusion: a great subject, but poorly treated. I understand people maybe get something out of this (I also picked up a few nice things), but I personally would not be able to recommend it to anyone in good conscience."
6376,"Ordinary Work, Extraordinary Grace: My Spiritual Journey in Opus Dei",Scott Hahn,4.28,318,23,Jeff Miller,4,"This book is partly an introduction to the spirituality of Opus Dei and also how Opus Dei was a influence in Scott Hahn's conversion and daily spiritual life. This book is not meant as a in depth introduction to Opus Dei and it's founder St. Josemaría Escrivá, but it does cover the basics. I was a loosely familiar with the charism of Opus Dei and some of the writings of St. Escrivá via the excellent commentary in the Navarre Bible, and through Scott Hahn's book I found that my understanding of Opus Dei was loose indeed. After reading this I found myself wanting to read deeper into St. Josemaría Escrivá writings. The spiritually of Opus Dei was much richer than I had suspected and that divine filiation was a cornerstone of it.Scott Hahn's books are always easy to read and he is able to explain complex theological ideas in an easy to grasp way. In this book he refrains from the massive punning that is characteristic of some of his other books. I generally love his puns, but I know some are turned off from his use of them and there feel they mar an otherwise serious work. I found it very interesting his description of the founding of Opus Dei and how its founding was many years in genesis. That St. Escrivá vision of this order had no expression until the Second Vatican Council and the creation of personal prelature of which Opus Dei is still the only one. We now mostly take for granted that ordinary life is a path to sanctity, something that was not much emphasized before Vatican II and that it was really St. Josemaría Escrivá who really lead the groundwork for the The Universal Call to Holiness in the Church in Lumen Gentium.Scott Hahn also details parts of his personal journey and how Opus Dei helped him in both incorporating devotions into his life, but in the times when his wife Kimberly was still not Catholic. Considering that Opus Dei has become such a boogeyman for some and that there are so many media distortions about it, it is rather surprising that Scott Hahn did not mention any of this or answer any of the common misconceptions. I realize he didn't write this as an apologetically work defending Opus Dei, but with such outright confusion considering The Da Vinci Code it is a rather odd oversight.Overall I really enjoyed this book and it gave me much to think on in how work is incorporated into your life and how it can really be a work of God."
7119,The Grand Inquisitor: with related chapters from The Brothers Karamazov,Fyodor Dostoyevsky,4.35,3678,161,Florencia,5,"Know, then, that now, precisely now, these people are more certain than ever before that they are completely free, and at the same time they themselves have brought us their freedom and obediently laid it at our feet. It is our doing, but is it what you wanted? This sort of freedom?This is a chapter from one of my favorite novels, The Brothers Karamazov. Some friends already know about my unconditional love for Dostoyevsky's work. Anything I say is extremely subjective and ultimately forgettable. Anyway, it is preferable to read the entire novel so as to not only enjoy that gem, but to basically understand the characters' particular views.Ah. The Lord and the inquisitor.‘Everything,’ they say, ‘has been handed over by you to the pope, therefore everything now belongs to the pope, and you may as well not come at all now, or at least don’t interfere with us for the time being.’Even when read separately, this section stands out for its lyrical force and, essentially, for the depth and intensity of its philosophical meditations concerning religion and human nature. Themes that—as someone who is always struggling in this small fragment of the world filled with fragile, ambivalent impressions—have been haunting one reader for many years now.We corrected your deed and based it on miracle, mystery, and authority. And mankind rejoiced that they were once more led like sheep, and that at last such a terrible gift, which had brought them so much suffering, had been taken from their hearts.Assumptions, everywhere. Confusion. Always the doubts. Always the fear. Ivan speaks. Alyosha, stunned.He comes for the chosen ones. The ones that will inherit the kingdom of God. The ones that amidst all the possible and impossible notions and mysteries that humanity cannot unveil, were chosen before they were even born. He was always aware of their identities. Their acts, their benevolence, their purity of heart. He always knew. They were created to be saved. As for the rest of us, we are left wondering if fate can take a turn. If simple mortals can bend the rules of eternity and challenge the decisions of an omniscient being by behaving like devoted Christians—that would be one case, since the concept of paradise and its constant truth is deeply connected to geography. Illusions of a mind that wonders if the unchosen ones can still create a path towards salvation.Many efforts have been made to reconcile the arguments of such delicate nature. And yet...We have a game. A war. The last battle between predestination and freedom, before the hunting begins.You want to go into the world, and you are going empty-handed, with some promise of freedom, which they in their simplicity and innate lawlessness cannot even comprehend, which they dread and fear—for nothing has ever been more insufferable for man and for human society than freedom!Jan 22, 16* Also on my blog."
7118,The Karamazov Brothers,Fyodor Dostoyevsky,4.31,180347,7828,Rawley,5,"If there was still any doubt, let me confirm that this actually is the greatest book ever written. But be warned that you need to set aside a solid month to get through it. And it's not light reading--this is a dense work of philosophy disguised as a simple murder mystery. But it's well worth the effort. It tackles the fundamental question of human existence--how best to live one's life--in a truly engaging way. Dostoevsky created 3 brothers (Ivan, Alexei, and Dmitri) with opposite answers to this fundamental question, and set them loose in the world to see what would happen. A testament to Dostoevsky's genius is he didn't know how the book would evolve when he started writing. As a consequence, the book really isn't about the plot at all, but about how these brothers evolve and deal with their struggles based on their differing world views.Dostoevsky articulates, better than anyone, how human beings really are what I would call ""walking contradictions"". Perhaps all of our struggles in life boil down to the reality that we desire contradictory things, simultaneously. If you like your novels with good character development, this is the masterwork. Dostoevsky's characters are more real, more human, than any other. At different points along the way, you will identify with them, sympathize with them, curse them, agonize over them, celebrate them. You will be moved.Reading this book was a deeply personal experience for me, because I saw myself in one of the characters, and I didn't like what I saw. My worldview, in fact my entire direction in life, shifted as a result of this experience. I can't guarantee the same results for you, but you owe it to yourself to set aside the time, someday, for the Brothers Karamazov.Be sure to read the Pevear Volokhonsky translation."
9465,Republic: The Theatre of the Mind,Plato,3.91,125289,2331,Brendan,1,"Let me explain why I'd recommend this book to everyone: Plato is stupid. Seriously.And it's important that you all understand that Western society is based on the fallacy-ridden ramblings of an idiot. Read this, understand that he is not joking, and understand that Plato is well and truly fucked in the head.Every single one of his works goes like this:SOCRATES: ""Hello, I will now prove this theory!""STRAWMAN: ""Surely you are wrong!""SOCRATES: ""Nonsense. Listen, Strawman: can we agree to the following wildly presumptive statement that is at the core of my argument?"" {Insert wildly presumptive statement here— this time, it's ""There is such a thing as Perfect Justice"" and ""There is such a thing as Perfect Beauty"", among others.}STRAWMAN: ""Yes, of course, that is obvious.""SOCRATES: ""Good! Now that we have conveniently skipped over all of the logically-necessary debate, because my off-the-wall crazy ideas surely wouldn't stand up to any real scrutiny, let me tell you an intolerably long hypothetical story.""{Insert intolerably long hypothetical story.}STRAWMAN: ""My God, Socrates! You have completely won me over! That is brilliant! Your woefully simplistic theories should become the basis for future Western civilization! That would be great!""SOCRATES: ""Ha ha! My simple rhetorical device has duped them all! I will now go celebrate by drinking hemlock and scoring a cameo in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure!""The moral of the story is: Plato is stupid."

Determined to make it on their own they set out to find a safe place for them. They lived in an old box car in the woods because they didn't have any family left that they knew about. One day the oldest one named Henry saw an add for a race and he decided to go there. The coach's last name was Aladin just like their last name. Then the man went over to Henry and realized that was one of his missing grandchildren, so they went and got the rest of the children and they all lived together.

There are too many cultural and historical references for me to understand without a little background first. Now I'm more prepared to complete Rushdie's book and I may reread this Schurer's book when I've finished Midnight's Children. Perhaps, I should have looked for a foot noted version of Midnight's Children because I would have liked more detail about the actual context."
7031,Things a Woman Should Know About Beauty,Karen Homer,3.63,16,2,Deborah Martinez,4,"This book caught my eye at the library so I picked it up, and it was a quick read (2 hours, and I am a slow reader!) I enjoyed the quotes and pictures of iconic beauties the best. Think timeless actresses like Audry Hepburn and Grace Kelly. ""Nothing makes a woman more beautiful than the belief that she is beautiful."" ~ Sophia Loren I enjoyed the helpful tipsthat you can take care of yourself to make you look more beautiful, makeup tips, manicure/pedicure tips/diet and wellness tips. I think all women want to be beautiful, but it takes time and effort to pull it off if you do not have natural beauty. Also, in today's society it is hard not to judge yourself constantly, and then you see the magazine covers, and even though you know they are photo shopped, it is in your face at all times that it what we should look like. Thankfully, as the old saying goes, ""beauty is only skin deep."""
7035,"Morality for Beautiful Girls (No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, #3)",Alexander McCall Smith,3.97,32747,1544,Anne Hawn Smith,5,"Reading these books is more like visiting with friends. If you are looking for action and plot, this will not really appeal to you, especially if you have read some of the others. These books are more of a slice of life.This was one of my favorites because of the depression that overcomes Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni. It comes over him so gradually and the people who love him are so concerned for him. I could almost feel myself becoming concerned for him also. Since I suffer from depression from time to time (not just the blues) I found the characterization very good. It's hard to portray how abnormal a person's thinking becomes and Smith does a great job. It's easy to stand on the outside and tell the depressed person to get out and visit friends, but the sick person feels that no one would like to be around him and that he is a burden to his friends; he thinks they would all sigh with relief if he got out of their lives.And that brings up another thing I like about these books. The people are not perfect. They are a combination of the good and the bad and they all struggle to get along in the best way possible. They don't just walk away from each other either."
7032,The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency Set: The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency/Tears of the Giraffe/Morality for Beautiful Girls/The Kalahari Typing School For Men/The Full Cupboard of Life,Alexander McCall Smith,4.25,735,86,Friederike Knabe,4,"The inspiration for the No.1 Lady Detective, Ma Ramotswe, came to McCall Smith while he observed a ""traditionally built and cheerful"" woman chasing a chicken in a yard in Botswana. Precious Ramotswe became the heroine of this delightful and engaging series. The box set contains the first three volumes and, as an extra treat, an African folk tale from a forthcoming collection. If you, as I did, just bought the first volume on its own, keep it to lend or give to friends and get the set right away. Mm Ramotswe's charm, humanity and her special sense of fairness will keep you entertained and your heart warmed. You will feel like the author who could not leave Ma Ramotswe at the end of the first book - ""it would have been like leaving in the middle of a conversation"".The diverse cases handled by the No 1 Ladies Detective Agency, while providing a thread through the books, are not really the main theme. The stories provide the reader with an insight into social aspects of one African society rarely offered in such a caring and empathic way. With great sensitivity McCall Smith explores rising conflicts between the traditional values of Botswana society and the modern influences brought from the cities across the border in South Africa. Of course, there are also the usual domestic conflicts that are the bread and butter of private detectives. Mma Ramotswe solves these with aplomb and wit, using common sense and her own version of justice. It is sometimes more important to teach the culprit a lesson and change his ways than to hand him (or her) over to the police authorities...Through all the descriptions of her cases and daily goings on in her life, McCall Smith reveals his love for Botswana, her people and the environment. With each volume, we get more intimately involved with the main characters. In addition to Precious, her fiancé, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, her assistant Mma Makutsi and her father, the late Obed Ramotswe who continues to play an important role in her life are major players. One would love to sit down with Precious on the veranda of her house on Zebra Drive to watch the sun set behind the trees and, drinking her favourite bush tea, reflect on life and its quirky sides. Fortunately there are more stories on the way in this highly entertaining and winning series."
7036,"The Kalahari Typing School for Men (No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, #4)",Alexander McCall Smith,3.99,30675,1301,Writerlibrarian,3,"Fourth installment in this amazing series. You don't read Mma Ramotswe novels for the action or even for the mysteries. You read them for the gentle rhythm of the narration, the wise philosophy of the characters. In this we rejoin Mma Ramostwe as she waits for her fiancée to set a date for their wedding after his illness. Mr Matekoni is slowly coming out of depression and finds his motor repair shop in the good hands of Mma Makutsi who shares her time between the detective agency and the auto repair shop. The joy of these novels is the intimate view of how the characters live, their values, how they set goals for themselves and go after them. Mma Makutsi finds a way to get ahead and make a life for herself beyond the limits of her current situation : single, with a sick brother to take care of and very low income. Mma Ramotswe faces competition with the opening of a new detective agency run by a male detective with international experience. Everything ends well, despite some minor moral growing pains. I like the philosophy, the values McCall Smith projects thru his characters in this simple, yet very nourishing for the soul, series."
69,The Known World,Edward P. Jones,3.82,29737,2866,karen,3,"there is that old adage that a good book will tell you how to read it. and i have no idea to whom that should be attributed, only that my undergrad professors seemed to have been born to quote that thought endlessly: in my gothic lit class, my enlightenment class, my victorian lit class... the african and irish lit professors mostly kept their mouths shut on the subject. but the rest - hoo boy - did they love to drag that old chestnut out... and it makes sense, to a certain degree. but this book doesn't tell you how to read it so much as it presents itself to the reader, like a fat man in a speedo lolling around on an undersized towel saying, ""look at me ladies, you like it?? this is what you get!!"" it almost demands that you read it and like it.but i was disobedient.every sentence, every paragraph, seemed to be trying to contain multitudes. and i am a fan of ""thick"" writing, but the manner in which this book presented itself quickly soured on me. there were too many stories or episodes ending with, ""years from now, when celia was on her deathbed, she would think back to her third year of marriage"",in a scene where she has yet to even be married, or right after two characters are introduced to each other, ""this would be the last time they would meet until the hailstorm of aught-six"" - and i am making up all the names and situations here, but you get an idea of the shape of my complaints. it's constant foreshadowing and some of the foreshadowing is just teasing, as the events never come to pass in the novel itself. it's like sitting down to tea with a god in his dotage, rambling and making connections only he can understand; seeing the past and future simultaneously.""hey, karen, didn't you really like that kjaerstaad trilogy, where he basically did what you are complaining about here??""yeah, what? so? shut up - isn't it past your bedtime??yeah, but sure, that's true. but for some reason, it bothered me here. all i wanted was a straightforward linear narrative about a fascinating subject matter: free black men and women who owned slaves. when i read roll of thunder, hear my cry last summer, the whole transition period between slavery and freedom really excited my brainparts. i dunno. and mister jones was a real sweetheart when he came for the new yorker festival and i waited in line to get a book signed for a friend and i really wanted to like it because it seems like a nice fat sprawling sweeping story the way i like, but i just got lost in the names and the timeline and my confusion turned into apathy. it's like this guy you date who seems really perfect - he is smart and looks like gabriel byrne and he dotes on you and everything is fun and on paper it all looks great and you know you should really like him, but he just doesn't make you laugh so you run off and leave him for a rockstar. you know? because i feel like i should like this one because it is award-winning, and my experience with the african-american novel is middling (although i love the african novel, the west indian novel and the afro-canadian novel - go figure) so i feel like as someone who appreciates literature in general, i should totally love this. but it wasn't there for me.oh, chris wilson, i am sorry. now you are going to want full custody because your baby is being raised among heathens. years from now, when my and chris wilson's book-baby became the mayor of littleton, he would read this review and a tear of sorrow would come to his eye at my short-sightedness."

Even though life in Botswana is most likely very different than life in Canada, there is something about the tone or writing style that reminds me of life at my grandparent's house.

1388,Odyssey,Homer,3.73,718023,8252,Stephen,4,"So my first “non-school related"" experience with Homer’s classic tale, and my most powerful impression, beyond the overall splendor of the story, was...HOLY SHIT SNACKS these Greeks were a violent bunch. Case in point:  ...they hauled him out through the doorway into the court, lopped his nose and ears with a ruthless knife, tore his genitals out for the dogs to eat rawand in manic fury hacked off hands and feet. then once they’d washed their own hands and feet they went inside again to join odysseus.their work was done here now. ""Their work was done here now."" What a great line. Want more violence you say? How about slaughtering over 100 house guests for over-indulging in your hospitality? Can you say overkill!! And for the true splatter junkies out there, you can add in some casual rapes, widespread maiming, a score of people-squishing, crew members being chewed and swallowed, healthy doses of mutilation and torture, and one cyclops blinding. That should make even the most discriminating gore hound leg-humping happy. Yes...that's me...guilty. However, beyond the cockle-warming violence and mayhem, this is a rocking good story that I enjoyed (as in ""smile on my face thinking this is genuinely cool”) much more than I expected to going into it. There is nothing dry or plodding about the story. Beautifully written, and encompassing themes of love, loyalty and heroism while commenting on many facets of the human condition. As important as this story is to literature, it is above all else...ENTERTAINING. In fact, without its massive entertainment factor, I'm pretty sure it's overall importance among the classics would be significantly reduced. Thankfully, there is no risk of that. 
  A NOTE ON THE TEXT
Before I continue, I want to comment on the version I read/listened to because I think can be critical to people’s reaction to the story. There are a TRUCKLOAD of Odyssey translations out there and, from what I’ve seen, they range wider in quality and faithfulness to the original text than those of almost any other work of Western Literature. These versions can differ so much that I believe two people with identical reading tastes could each read a different translation and walk away with vastly different opinions on the work. The version I am reviewing (and from which the above quote is derived) is the Robert Fagles translation which uses contemporary prose and structure while remaining faithful to the content of the original. I found it a terrific place for a “first experience” with this work because of how easy to follow it was. Plus, I listened to the audio version read by Sir Ian McKellen which was an amazing experience and one I HIGHLY RECOMMEND. In addition to the Fagles version, I also own the Alexander Pope translation as part of my Easton Press collection of The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written. While listening to the Fagles version, I would often follow along with the Pope translation and let me tell you....they are vastly different. While the overall story is the same, the presentation, prose and the structure are nothing alike. As an example, here is the same passage I quoted earlier from the Pope translation. 
  Then forth they led [______], and beganTheir bloody work; they lopp’d away the man,Morsel for dogs! then trimm’d with brazen shears The wretch, and shorten’d of his nose and ears;His hands and feet last felt the cruel steel;He roar’d, and torments gave his soul to hell.They wash, and to Ulysses take their way:So ends the bloody business of the day.
 Very different treatments of the same scene. In my opinion, the Pope language is more beautiful and far more poetic and lyrical than the Fagles translation. However, I am glad I started with the Fagles version because it provided me with a much better comprehension of the story itself. No head-scratching moments. Now that I have a firm grounding in the story, I plan to go back at some point and read the Pope version so that I can absorb the greater beauty of that translation. In a nutshell, I'm saying that you should make sure you find a translation that works for you. That’s my two or three cents. 
  THE STORY
So Odysseus, master strategist and tactician (not to mention schemer, manipulator and liar extraordinaire), travels home to Ithaca after the Trojan War. Delays and detours ensue which take up the first half of the story. Most of these travel snags are caused by Poseidon, who is grudging on Odysseus for stick-poking Poseidon’s son (i.e. the Cyclops) in the peeper. Not to fear, Athena (goddess of guile and craftiness) is a proud sponsor of Odysseus and, along with some help for big daddy god Zeus, throws Odysseus some Olympian help. Odysseus’ travels are full of great summer blockbuster-like entertainment and at the same time explore all manner of Greek daily life as well as touching on many of their beliefs and traditions. It really is a perfect blend of fun and brain food. From his time on the island homes of the goddesses Calypso and Circe (who he gets busy with despite his “undying” love for his wife, Penelope...men huh?), to his run ins with the giant Laestrygonians and the Lotus-eaters (i.e., thugs and drugs) and his fateful encounter with the Cyclops, Polyphemus. Odysseus even takes a jaunt to the underworld where he speaks to Achilles and gets to listen to dead king Agamemnon go on an anti-marriage rant because his conniving wife poisoned him to death. Homer does a superb job of keeping the story epic while providing the reader with wonderful details about the life of the greek people during this period. The man had story-telling chops.. Meanwhile, while Odysseus is engaged in the ancient greek version of the Amazing Race, back on Ithaca we’ve got a full-fledged version of the Bachelorette going on as over a hundred suitors are camped out at Odysseus pad trying to get Penelope to give them a rose. This has Odysseus’ son, Telemachus, on the rage because the suitors are eating, drinking and servant-boinking him out of his entire inheritance while they wait on Penelope. You might think that Telemachus could just kick the freeloaders out, but the law of “hospitality” was huge for the Greeks and the suitor-douches use it to full advantage. Well Odysseus eventually makes it back to Ithaca, alone and in disguise, after all of this crew have been eaten, squashed, drowned or otherwise rendered life-impaired. Not an easy place to live is ancient Greece. Odysseus proceeds to work a web of deceit and revenge against the suitors that is a wonder to behold. I’ll leave the final climax to you, but I will say that there was no free lunch in Homer’s time and the checks that people wrote with their bad behavior are paid in full.
  MY THOUGHTS
 This was a fun, fun, fun read. I want to start with that because this is not one of those classics that I think is worth while only to get it under your belt or checked off a list. This was a great story with great characters and in a style that was both “off the usual path” but still easy to follow. Going back to my comments on the various versions of the story, I think this may end up being a five star read in one of the more flowery, densely poetic translations where the emotion and passion is just a bit more in your face. I am still thrilled to have listened to the version I did (especially as read by Gandalf) because I now have a firm foundation in the story and can afford to be a bit more adventurous with my next version. The tone of the story is heroic and yet very dark. The gods are capricious and temperamental and cause a whole lot of death and devastation for nothing more than a bruised ego or even a whim. The pace of the story is fast and moves quickly with hardly a chance to even catch your breath. It is a big epic story...it is THE BIG EPIC STORY...and its reputation is well deserved. A terrific read as well as one of the most important works in the Western canon. Definitely worth your time. 4.5 stars. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!! "

1196,Tyler's Ultimate: Brilliant Simple Food to Make Any Time,Tyler Florence,4.12,3206,35,Nathaniel ,1,"I had high hopes for this book after seeing Tyler make an absolutely mouth-watering looking fried chicken on his program. When someone bought this off my Amazon wishlist later on, I was hoping that we would at least have that one recipe, plus a whole lot of other good ones. I was wrong. The recipes in this book are awful. Many are flat out inedible (macaroni and cheese topped with onions and peas comes readily to mind), and few have obviously been tested before publication. The directions for most of the recipes haven't even been copy-edited properly. I understand that celebrity chefs are often lazy, but this is the worst example of that I've ever seen. This book was quite obviously written by interns who don't even know how to cook. Adding insult to injury, the fried chicken recipe wasn't even the same one from the show, meaning someone wasted $25 on this pathetic excuse for a cookbook for absolutely no reason whatsoever. It's almost as though Tyler couldn't be bothered to even donate any of his own recipes, forcing some poor college student to recreate them (poorly) from the show. On top of that, the fact that Florence may quite possibly be the most arrogant man on the planet and obviously wrote his own copy about how every recipe in the book is the best ever is just tacky. Why go through that much effort to toot your own horn and not even bother to write out your own recipes? I gave this book chance after chance, every time trying a new recipe thinking ""it can't possibly be as bad as the last one"". Every time, this book ruined dinner, guaranteed. I cannot say that for any other cookbook I have ever owned, before or since, and I've been told I'm a fairly good cook. This book is so bad that even a new hardcover in good condition had no resale value. After the third or fourth time that this book produced an utterly inedible meal, I finally said enough was enough and donated it to Goodwill. Tyler Florence has permanently lost my business, and my respect."

2777,Graphic Design: A History,Alain Weill,3.95,39,5,Roberto,4,"This book is an overview on the history of graphic design. To talk about graphic design one must talk about advertising and the many movements in art as well as technical innovations. The author does a great job in explaining, however briefly, the connections between all of those and how relevant they are to our modern practice. This book is not a “complete history,” nor a collection of “the best of,” and there's no claim that it tries to be. I think this book may be relevant for students and professionals alike, specially as a supplementary reading for a class or other books."
2781,Immigrant Acts: On Asian American Cultural Politics,Lisa Lowe,3.94,189,8,L,5,"A very balanced book that looks at the condition of the Asian immigrant through the light of history, literature and politics. Lowe is probably at her best and most passionate in the discussion of the state of Asian immigrant women, and of the need for all of us to cross borders of race, ethnicity and class in order to work towards positive change. She manages to contextualize some basic ideas while at the same time going in depth with some theories of Marx, Althusser, Audre Lorde, Fanon, Benjamin, and others and connecting them to this situation in ways I haven't thought of previously. She also does some great reading of Jessica Hagedorn's Dogeaters, Fae Myenne Ng's Bone, Carlos Bulosan's America is in the Heart: A Personal History, and, especially, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha's Dictee. Her writing can at times be dense and takes some getting used to, but it is a very important work to Asian American studies so it can't be ignored. It is winner of the 1997 Book Award in Cultural Studies from the Association for Asian American Studies and an HOnoroable Mention for the 1997 John Hope Franklin Prize for the best book published in American studies. It brings out some major issues in feminist studies, Marxist studies, and Asian American and immigrant history in general."

Meggs,4.14,1919,53,Victoria,3,"I took a summer class on the History of Graphic Design and had to read this book...not cover-cover, but pretty close. It's the only class I've actually had the time to complete all of the assigned readings for, and I'm really glad I did. This book is the only one of its kind that I've found. I learned so much from it. It's always been very confusing to try to find where our history is (as graphic designers)...Meggs was the first to really pool all the information in one place. The only qualms I had with this book was that for being a book ON graphic design, they really didn't take great care in designing it too well. The book is long and slightly dull as you'd expect any textbook to get after a while, but the sans-serif made it slightly even more painful, and the layout was very disorganized (figure references don't show up until pages after they're already been discussed, you can read a full spread of straight text -which is agonizing- and then skim through a full spread of pictures, etc). The book is set up to give you a general overview of each movement, so it can be a little frustrating when your favorite designer gets a paragraph of recognition and Herbert Bayer gets ten pages, but in all honesty you can't expect a subjective topic like design to be perfectly aligned with what you view as more important.All in all, I think its essential for any designer. Just like with painting, it's kinda hard to find your niche when you haven't had a chance to study the renaissance. It's definitely enriched my design background and vocabulary. You have to know your rules before you can break them, but you also have to know your history so you can see why people made the rules in the first place."

The intern, Nadia Zarinski, was found in the alley behind the Ford’s Theatre. “Cause? Subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhages. Manner or death? Blow to the head with blunt, broad object.”Ms. Zarinski has been rumored to be having an affair with the senator. The senator is ex-husband of Clarise Emerson, the theatre’s producing director. The case is assigned to Rick Klayman and Mo Johnson, detectives from the Crimes Against Persons Unit, of the MPD.The senator and his ex-wife are both career oriented, him wanting to run for president and her currently under consideration for the director of the NEA. It does not help when their son, Jeremiah, who had a sexual relationship with the intern, is charged with the murder.The book was well researched as far as history of the Ford’s Theatre and the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln. There were a couple of mistakes in the author’s police procedural knowledge and a couple of streets were incorrectly names. Otherwise, I enjoyed to mystery.This book is part of the Capital Crimes series written by the author, the daughter of President Harry Truman. "

I'm not going to bother with that sort of thing on my death-bed.""Not much can stir up old squabbles, grudges and festering resentments like the reading of a will, and I'm pretty sure Aunt Becky has that in mind when she orders all her relatives to gather before her. First, she insults each and every one by mocking their physical defects or penchants for writing bad poetry. For some, she brings up old missteps and embarrassments. One woman's crime? She once made jam from blueberries gathered in a graveyard. Horrors! Old Becky then proceeds to read off her will, leaving her furniture and other household items to those who want them least. Why is everyone putting up with this crap? They ALL hope to be the one who inherits a rather ugly jug that has been in the family for ages. Who gets it? Well, the answer is in a sealed envelope to be opened and read...in about a year and a half.What follows is a delightful comedy of manners and errors as each family member jostles to be the lucky owner of the jug. Men attempt to stop swearing. Couples come together and split apart. Confirmed bachelors decide that perhaps they should take wives. Secrets are revealed and old mysteries are solved. Montgomery is best known as the creator of the beloved Anne of Green Gables, but she really proves her mettle as a writer with this sly comic masterpiece. The only reason I did not assign five stars is that I was a bit taken aback that the book ends with a racist joke. It was so out of the blue and so out of character for Ms. Montgomery, it was a like a slap in the face. For shame, Anne Shirley's mommy. For shame!"
2287,"Other Voices, Other Rooms",Truman Capote,3.82,10357,682,K.D. Absolutely,3,"In 1935, at an early age of 11, Capote began writing. The first novel that he attempted to write was Summer Crossing but one day, while he and a fellow southerner and writer Carlson McCullers, the author of The Heart is a Lonely Hunter (1940), were walking in the woods, he got inspired to write something about the rural life in the South. So, he set Summer Crossing aside and wrote this book. This then became his first published book (1948) when Capote was 24 years old. The style is Southern Gothic and it is semi-autobiographical.This is semi-autobiographical because what he wrote was mostly based on his actual experiences in Monroeville, Alabama where he grew up with the 1961 Pulitzer winner, Harper Lee, author of the modern classic To Kill a Mockingbird. Capote and Lee were best of friends so they made each other as character in their own respective novels. Harper Lee's character called Dill was based on Truman as a boy and Capote's Idabel Thompkins in this book was based on the tomboyish Harper Lee when she was a young girl. This 1948 book did not win Capote any award but it stayed in the New York Times Bestseller list for 9 weeks. After 13 years, Harper Lee came up with her only novel To Kill a Mockingbird and it did not only win her a Pulitzer but also the hearts of many people around the world.This book may not have made an impact as strong as Mockingbird but Capote's writing is as good, if not even better, than Harper Lee's. The only thing missing here, I guess, is that it did not tackle social and racial inequality issue but rather focused on those minor themes that are also present in Mockingbird such as courage, compassion, decadence and isolation. Both books have Gothic southern elements but Lee used it for humor while Capote used it for mystery if not to actually scare. So, overall, I agree that Mockingbird is a notch higher than this debut novel of Capote.The story revolves around a 13-y/o boy Joel Knox whose mother has just died. One day, he receives a letter from his father inviting him to live with him in a place called Skully's Landing. Joel does not know his father because he was an infant when his father abandoned him and his mother. Left with no choice, he travels all by himself from New Orleans to his father's house. Before seeing his father, he meets all the other people in the town including the sisters Florabel and Idabel Thompkins. They become his friends particularly Idabel. Towards the end of the novel, Joel finally meets his father and he is shocked to find out his father's condition. Prior to that meeting he had high expectations on what his life would be with his father even writing rosy pictures to his friend back in New Orleans.My favorite scene is one of those first few encounters of Joel Knox (Capote) and Idabel Thompkins (Harper Lee). Idabel asks Joel if he has been snakebit. Joel says no but he has survived being ran down by a car. Florabel (Idabel's sister) says ""now Idabel will think of having herself run down by a car."" This reminded me when I was young and I got to argue with my playmates who had a better toy or who had the richer father or who had gone to a farther place - city or town, etc. That scene made me laugh imagining how the tomboyish Idabel would have been behaving considering the very vivid descriptions Capote spent in his prose for that girl.This is the last Capote book on my bookshelf. I am not yet his completist as far as his novels are concerned because I could not find a copy of The Grass Harp (1951). But as far as those that are available, here are they - fully read with many of their pages now dogeared (proof that I enjoyed reading them):4 STARS (I really liked these!):  and   3 STARS (I liked these!):

Paroled: 7-6-59.As I write this review, I'm sitting about 60 miles from the Clutter house in Holcomb, Kansas. Holcomb is a small, farming community located just west of Garden City. The line from the long running show Cheers perfectly describes this community. Where not only does everyone in the bar know your name, but everyone in the whole county knows your name and knows your family history. I don't own a copy of In Cold Blood. I usually avoid reading true crime books. I don't have any interest in filling my head with tragedy. I want to go about my life with a degree of caution, but not ruled by the fear I feel such books will instill. I stopped by the Dodge City Library, and as expected, they had several copies for me to choose from. The librarian at the check out desk, a woman about mid-sixties, slender, elegant, and still attractive paused for a moment looking down at the book. She physically shivered. She looked up at me and said in a whisper, ""I remember when this happened"". She can remember watching her father put locks on the doors for the first time and knowing afterwards that there was life before the Clutter murders, and then there was life after the Clutter murders. Her response surprised me. In a time when any crime anywhere in the country is broadcast out to the nation I would have thought some of the impact of the Clutter murder would have been buried under the avalanche of murder and mayhem related to us on a daily basis. For this community and for all the small communities dotting the map of Kansas, and even in the surrounding states, this was something that wasn't supposed to happen in a small town. This was big city crime right in their backyard. As I talked to people about the Clutter murders most everybody had a physical reaction. They flinched as if they were dodging a blow. You could almost see the pages of their memories fluttering behind their eyes back to 1959. They attributed more deaths to the crime, each of them citing six deaths rather than four. This could have to do with the fact that there were six Clutters. The two older girls had already left the home and started their own lives and were not present on that fateful night when their family was murdered. In Cold Blood was required reading in many schools in this region clear up until about the 1970s, so even people who were too young to remember the crime have still been impacted by the murders. In the description above of Perry Edward Smith there is a reference to Phillips County. This has special significance for me because I was born and raised in Phillips County. The family farm is located in Phillips County. My Dad and I graduated from Phillipsburg High School. My Dad was a sophomore in high school in 1955 when Perry Smith decided to burglarize the Chandler Sales Company in Phillipsburg, Kansas and this seemingly insignificant act was really the beginning of this story. Smith and his accomplice, also Smith, stole typewriters, adding machines etc and got away clean. Later they ignored a traffic signal in St. Joseph, Missouri and were pulled over by a cop. All the loot was wedged into the backseat of the car eliciting the wrong kinds of questions from law enforcement. They were extradited back to Phillipsburg, where through an open window (image my embarrassment for the law enforcement of my home county)they escaped. Later Perry was caught again and sent back to Phillipsburg where the law enforcement did a better job of keeping track of him. Perry Smith received 10 years in the Kansas Penitentiary in Leavenworth. Richard Eugene Hickock was already serving time in Leavenworth for fraud. The two met and became friends. The final piece to the puzzle that not only determined the fate of the Clutter family, but also the fates of Smith and Hickock was for them to meet Floyd Wells. Wells, serving time for some bit of stupidity, had worked for Herb Clutter back in 1948. He told Hickock and Smith that Clutter was not only a rich farmer, but kept a safe full of cash in his house. He was absolutely full of shit. There was no safe. There was no pile of cash. There was absolutely no reason for four people to lose their lives for $40.   After the murders they went to Mexico for a while, but even though they could live cheaply money still trickled through their fingers, after they burned through the goods they had acquired through the Clutter robbery and through defrauding retail stores, they found that working in Mexico didn't pay well either. They came back up to the United States and there was an interesting moment from the time they were in Miami that for me was really indicative of a level of detachment they were able to maintain. Perry Smith is reading the paper and sees an article about a family that was tied up and shot to death. ""Amazing!"" Perry glanced through the article again. ""Know what I wouldn't be surprised? If this wasn't done by a lunatic. Some nut that read about what happened out in Kansas."" WTF? Some nut? How about the original coconut heads that murdered the family in Kansas? Perry does have a moment or two where he weighs what happened in Kansas. ""Know what I think?"" said Perry. ""I think there must be something wrong with us. To do what we did.""""Did what?""""Out there.""""Deal me out, baby,"" Dick said. ""I'm a normal.""Truman Capote had been looking for the right story for an experimental form of writing he'd been thinking about. He wanted to blend fiction and nonfiction and the Clutter murders struck him as the perfect story to launch this new form of writing. I have to admire his fortitude, for a man of his sensibilities not only spending that much time among farmbillies, but having to befriend them as well. It must have been somewhat of a painful experience. 
  Capote in the Clutter homeFloyd Wells eventually comes forward and tells what he knows about the murders. He had always liked Herb Clutter and felt bad that what he had told, in a moment of prison bonding, had led to such a vicious conclusion. Without his statement I'm pretty sure that Smith and Hickock would have gotten away with the murders. The slender evidence tying them to the murders would have made it almost impossible to prosecute them. They are convicted with the help of their signed confessions, and the punishment is death. As they are being led back to their cells:Smith says to Hickock, ""No chicken-hearted jurors, they!"" They both laughed loudly, and a cameraman photographed them. The picture appeared in a Kansas paper above a caption entitled: ""The Last Laugh?""This is a beautifully written book. I want to thank Harper Lee for her role in helping Capote bring this book to completion. I'm not sure Capote would have had the perseverance to see it through without her holding his hand. I was long overdue to read this. I'm glad that ""On the Southern Literary Trail"" selected to read this book. It was the right push to get me past my own reticence in avoiding this genre. I certainly have a connection to this book and that may have colored my perceptions and certainly may have elevated my rating of the book, but given the historic nature of the book, ushering in a new genre that is still vibrantly alive today; I think most anyone should put this on their reading list."
2288,Answered Prayers - The Unfinished Novel,Truman Capote,3.49,2789,214,K.D. Absolutely,3,"Too bad that this is an unfinished novel. I could have given this at least 4 stars.According to Wiki, Capote was not able to finish this novel because he got busy with the stardom In Cold Blood (4 stars) gave him. In 1966, he signed a contract with Random House to write this book with January 1st 1968 as the delivery date. He missed the date and the contract was renegotiated in 1969 with 1973 as the new delivery date. He missed again so it was moved further to 1974. Missed again so on to 1977. Missed again so it was moved to 1981. Then he died of liver cancer in 1984. He was 59 years old.But he was able to finish these 4 chapters and they got published in Esquire. One of the four, ""Mojave"" was moved to his earlier book Music for Chameleons (3 stars) and only 3 got compiled in this book that was first published in 1986, the year of his death.The story revolves around P. B. Jones the 30ish masseur who is also the narrator of the story. Jones is also an aspiring writer so he always looks forward to meeting writers and entertainment personalities. Not contented with his income, he is lured to also sell his body as a male prostitute catering to the needs of rich gays and lonely matrons.Capote's original plan was to make this book the modern counterpart of Marcel Proust's In Search of Lost Time. The whole idea was to write his own experiences including the lives of the rich and famous in the high society but changing the names of his characters to protect them. Well, he did that in these 3 chapters and the result, for me, was very promising: the prose is well-written, the exposes are intriguing and the telling is frank and no-holds-barred. I do not know all of these people mentioned in the book except those famous ones whose real names Capote used such these three: here Montgomery Cliff is being touched by the drunk Dorothy Parker and Estelle Winwood is telling Dottie to stop but she continues: ""Sensitive. So finely made. The most beautiful young man I've ever seen. What a pity he's a cocksucker.""Kate McCloud (2nd chapter) or Ann Dillon (3rd chapter) are housewives of rich businessmen who they killed apparently to get their inheritance and marry their respective lovers. Well, another reason why Capote was unable to finish this book was that the characters in this book were his friends and upon publication of the stories, they started to stay away from him. An example of this is the chapter ""La Cote Basque"" that readers are saying to be a resemblance of what happened to Capote's benefactor, CBS Mogul Bill Paley and his wife Babe. Another Wiki entry says that Kate McCloud was in fact a real person who shot her husband in the shower thinking that he was a burglar. She went unpunished, got her inheritance but later killed herself. Their two kids also committed suicide some years later.These juicy exposes that Capote told in elegant fashion make this book really an entertaining read. Behind the posh and glamour of the American and Parisian societies are stories of prostitution, drugs, alcoholism, deceit and murder. However, the book does not end up like those showbiz gossip magazines, Capote is too brilliant to allow his last book to be like those.An example is this scene when Woodrow Hamilton is asking P. B. Jones about the novel that the latter is trying to write. Jones says that the title is Answered Prayers.:WH: ""Answered Prayers. A quote. I suppose.""PBJ: ""St. Teresa. I never looked it up myself, so I don't know exactly what she said, but it was something like 'More tears are shed over answered prayers than unanswered ones.'""WH: ""I see a light flickering. This book - it's about Kate McCloud, and gang.""PBJ: ""I wouldn't say it's about them - though they're in it.""WH: ""Then what is it about?""PBJ: ""Truth as illusion.""WH: ""And illusion is truth?""PBJ: ""The first. The second is another proposition.""WH: ""How so?""PBJ: ""As truth is nonexistent, it can never be anything but illusion - but illusion, the by-product of revealing artifice, can reach the summits nearer the unobtainable peak of Perfect Truth. For example, female impersonators. The impersonator is in fact a man (truth), until he recreates himself as a woman (illusion) - and of the two, the illusion is the truer.""If that is not brilliant writing, I don't know what it is."
9735,"Ender's Game Boxed Set: Ender's Game, Ender's Shadow, Shadow of the Hegemon",Orson Scott Card,4.48,1768,59,"James M. Madsen, M.D.",5,"I think that this is the right order for reading the Ender and Shadow series--chronologically. Start with Ender's Game (Ender Book 1), then read Ender's Shadow (Ender Book 5, an alternate telling of the events in Ender's Game from the viewpoint of a character who is fully as interesting as, if not more interesting than, Ender himself), and finally read the rest of the Shadow series, starting with Shadow of the Hegemon (Ender Book 6). After you've finished the currently published(as of 2008) Shadow books, you can then step out of chronological order briefly to read First Meetings in the Enderverse, which I think will mean more to you if you first know how important the characters in First Meetings are. Finally, you can then go on to read Speaker for the Dead (Ender Book 2), Xenocide (Ender Book 3), and Children of the Mind (Ender Book 4). Card is reportedly working on a book in which Ender's and Bean's paths will cross, so depending upon when the action of that book takes place, it might profitably be read before Ender Books 2, 3, and 4. All of these books are well worth the read, in my opinion. One dear friend of mine has commented that the children in Ender's Game would have been unlikely at their age to have the motor skills required for the battle training in Ender's Game, but I'm not so sure. Certainly current Armies recruit children, albeit not quite so young. Bean's case is even more outstanding, but he's different (as you'll find out when you read Ender's Shadow) for a special reason. Some of Card's earlier themes (such as the one in Wyrms) are more fully developed in this series, and as usual, he tackles large issues of morality and ethics in terms of the deeply personal choices that individuals have to make and in terms of the effects of those choices not just upon cultures and societies (think of his excellent The Worthing Saga) but also upon the individuals themselves (shades of Songmaster). I love these books and highly recommend them!"
5487,Carnegie,Peter Krass,4.01,200,19,Alison,4,"If ever there were a man you loved to hate . . . or in my case just hate. I feel for his struggles and his roots but Carnegie truly epitomizes classism and the horrible outcomes it can produce. But he is a product of his world in which individualism was the core value espoused by all who sought ""success"". This is a fantastic book. Peter Krass does an amazing job humanizing such a iconic figure. I wish it were more widely read so the terror that results from a man like Carnegie's ambitions would be deeper understood instead of heroified without full understanding of the circumstances that led to his development and the results of his actions."

That spin off of Card's was alright, but Speaker for the Dead, Xenocide, and Children of the Mind are my all time favorite books. THEY ARE AMAZING!!!!!The depth of the character developments, and explinations of other worlds and alien species - I cannot even begin to put into words what an expeirience it is to read these books. Card has you thinking about so many aspects of life and where our spirits come from and where we go after death. He dives into issues of being human and what that means in the face of extermination, or even the fear of it, how far a race will go to protect themselves to keep on living.Love these more than I could express! I hope Card keeps filling in the 3,000 year gap between Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead. I just can't get enough!!!!"

Why such vitriol for the book? Here you are, then. 1) Bad plotting: It didn't take me long to realise that after I was past Ender's arrival at the Battle School, every - literally every chapter thereon until his return to Earth - was more or less the same thing. Battle games, beating the shit out of kids, battle games, switching back and forth to Armies, battle games. It was so repetitive that I was exhausted at the end of every.single.chapter.

9738,"Ender's Shadow (Shadow Series, #1)",Orson Scott Card,4.3,127050,4643,Stephen,4," 4.0 to 4.5 stars. Okay, now don't turn away thinking that this book is just a ""re-telling"" of the story of Ender's Game from the perspective of the character of Bean. Not at all. This is not simply OSC cashing in on the success of the Ender Series. This is a completely different novel and there is little to no overlap in the actual events of Ender's Game. It simply takes place at the same time as those events. The purpose of this story is two fold. First, we get to really know Bean who turns out to be a character as gifted as Ender and whose life story is absolutely fascinating. Growing up poor and homeless on the streets in Amsterdam, Bean difficult early childhood is used as the backdrop to explore the Earth of Ender's Game and provide much greater detail of the socio-political-economic environment. I love that kind of stuff so I was in heaven. From there, we get to see Bean's recruitment into Battle School and watch the very different road he takes through the Formic (or bugger) War described in Ender's Game. At the end, it feels like we have finally been told the complete story. The second and MUCH MORE IMPORTANT purpose of this novel is to set the stage for the novels that follow (Shadow of the Hegemon, Shadow Puppets and Shadow of the Giant), of which Bean is a central character and which deals with the aftermath of the Formic wars on Earth and the rise of Peter Wiggins (Ender's brother) as Hegemon of Earth. This is a wonderful novel and the beginning of a new and exciting chapter in the Ender saga.

410,V.,Thomas Pynchon,3.97,16233,839,Aubrey,4,"4.5/5Knowledge is a funny business. Everyone pretends omniscience in the classroom, but god forbid you spout off like an intellectual outside of it. And then you have the subculture of people making an effort to read Pynchon in public, and the other subcultures that amuse themselves at their expense. The verdict seems to be know it all, but please, spare us from your efforts to prove it.I'd sell my soul to write like this at the age of six and twenty. There, I admitted to lack of know-how when it comes to the realm of Pynchon. Of course, the reference to souls might not be worth much coming from someone with no memory of being religious in any sense, but I'd like to think the Catholic upbringing accredits the statement somewhat. My horse may be hitched to atheism, but I can still appreciate good theological diatribes with healthy roots in philosophy and literature.Which is what I'm getting at here. Roots. Easily graspable statements with esoteric legs to stand on. A sense of context that spans the contemporary as easily as the ancient, and ties the two together in the delightfully tangible sense. Ivory computers, porcelain circuitry, old materials caking the eternal Street from 1955's Norfolk to 1919's Malta and beyond. To say the word 'automaton' and have the images of golems and cyborgs seamlessly interweave on the succeeding pages. This isn't your banal tactic of cultural references and knowledge dropping at every turn. I suppose I should give credit to Neal Stephenson for setting up an apparatus of tin foil and pipe cleaner, to better display Pynchon's idol of ebony and titanium. The desire to imitate that deceptive depth of story is understandable. Not everyone can write in the style of the yo-yo, apex to apex, apocheir to apocheir, without the bottom ponderously dropping out or the string severing at the zenith or the snagging speed making the ride sickening to the stomach.And again, six and twenty! 1963! In the US! Did you know that this book passes the Bechdel Test? I wouldn't have believed it either, least not without reading it for myself. Or believed without experiencing for myself how conscious the story is of life and its seeming coincidences, long lines of 'plot' drifting back and forth from immediate relevance to useless trivia. It never forsakes the surface details for the underlying meaning, and vice versa, and there's even spots of real humor and true beauty to be found. It's a rare talent that belies Pynchon's youth, to describe the passions that drive the intricate clockwork of the small days, and contextualize them in the themes that have, do, and will span for millenia. And to switch from one to the other without any noticeable jerks or shuddering! It makes one question the validity of the categories of knowledge that we function in, conventional discourse that so many gain use of by sacrificing the essence of their critical thinking. Puzzle pieces guaranteeing a pretty picture, inherently forsaking its right to a blank canvas. ""Events seem to be ordered into an ominous logic."" It repeated itself automatically and Stencil improved on it each time, placing emphasis on different words--""events seem""; ""seem to be ordered""; ""ominous logic""--pronouncing them differently, changing the ""tone of voice"" from sepulchral to jaunty, round and round and round. Events seem to be ordered into an ominous logic.So, knowledge? Pynchon has it, and shows it in endless waves of connective tissues. I don't claim to understand all of it. But I have to thank him for my new-found way of thinking about this reading business of mine, my yo-yoing along the V shaped tracks of books like his, picking up bits and pieces with every passing over the same old stomping grounds. There's a surface of tin cans and plastic rubbish in those lands, and a wind whistling of ages past that sounds all the clearer the longer you walk. You can walk forward, and you can walk back, but to tread the same way twice is an impossibility, for better or for worse."
8234,Saving Graces: The Inspirational Writings of Laura Ingalls Wilder,Laura Ingalls Wilder,4.2,50,7,Rosa Cline,5,"I absolutely loved this book! I really like the Little House series and thought I would venture into biographies of Laura to see how 'true' the series were... or also just to get to know her a little better. This book is small devotionals (which I really appreciated) which if you don't have time to read a lot then just pick the book up and read one and a half to three pages at a time and you get the full effect of what Laura is telling you. In each 'chapter' it includes a favorite Bible verse that goes along with what Laura is explaining. Almost like sitting in a Sunday school room with her, or better yet sitting in her living room and just being her best friend. These devotionals cover everything from treating your neighbor correctly to a few chapters on the government (which to me in my early 40's was interesting because it was right after WWI she speaks of.)She speaks some of Almonzo which she refers to as 'man of the house' and things that sometimes affect him as well. Just over all I loved this book... a great inspirational book, devotion book, or just a really good book to realize how Laura Ingallas Wilder really was."
1370,The Persian War (Translations from Greek & Roman Authors),Herodotus,4.04,384,6,Erik Graff,4,"I'd enjoyed Thucydides in college but had avoided Herodotus because he was not cited as being as reliable as a source. Applying for work at a great books college which required Herodotus, however, got me to read the thing and it turned out to be much, much more interesting than expected.While Thucydides comes across as a recognizable historian, Herodotus comes across as an elderly, well-travelled storyteller. Many of his accounts, including his explanation of the ultimate causes of the Persian War, are pure myth, but his account of the war itself and the events leading up to it constitute the first real history we have of anything.The book isn't just about the Persian War, however. It also includes descriptions of the lifeways of various exotic peoples including, notably, the Scythians and Egyptians. One imagines Herodotus making a living as a lecturer to enthralled, and possibly skeptically amused, audiences in his old age."
1369,The History,Herodotus,3.97,32557,899,Grace Tjan,4,"What I learned from this book (in no particular order):1.	Ancient Greeks are quarrelsome and love to waste each other’s city-states for the pettiest reasons. 2.	From all forms of government known to man, democracy is the best. Tyrants and oligarchs suck.3.	The Persian Empire is a mighty barbarian nation, but being cowardly, effeminate and slavish, it is eventually defeated by the quarrelsome but brave and civilized Greeks.4.	Among the Greeks, the Spartans are the bravest. Gerard Butler with a six-pack King Leonidas and his 300 Spartans heroically perished in the battle of Thermopylae. They also have the particularly icky custom of marrying their own nieces.5.	The Delphic oracles are 100% accurate, except when someone manages to corrupt the Pythoness. The Gods are, however, a jealous sort and would strike any mortal who has the presumption of calling himself happiest on earth. Therefore, one should call no man happy until he is dead.6.	Egypt is a country of wonders, but its citizens’ customs and manners are exactly the reverse of the common practice of mankind elsewhere. For example, the women there urinate standing up, while the men sitting down. The country also abounds in strange fauna, among them the hippopotamus --- a quadruped, cloven-footed animal, with the mane and tail of a horse, huge tusks and a voice like a horse’s neigh. 7.	The Scythians are a warlike nation that practices human sacrifice. The Scythian soldier drinks the blood of the first man that he kills in battle and cuts off all of his enemies’ heads, which he must show to the king to get his share of the war booty. They also like to saw off their enemies’ skulls, which they make into fancy gold-plated drinking cups.8.	The manners of the Androphagi, being cannibals, are more savage than those of any other race. Darius the Persian smote them.9.	The Atarantians, alone of all known nations, are destitute of names. The title of Atarantians is borne by the whole race in common, but the men have no particular names of their own. They also like to curse the sun because he burns and wastes both their country and themselves.10.	In the Indian desert live ants that are larger than a fox. They like to throw up sand-heaps as they burrow, which are full of gold. This is why India is so rich in gold. In Arabia, there are sheep that have long tails, so long that the shepherds have to make little trucks for their tails. Really.BUT SERIOUSLY,Herodotus is a consummate storyteller who had a fine eye for the fantastical, although to his credit, he always qualified his more improbable assertions by stating that they are based on hearsay or other sources that he could not wholly verify. Much of the pleasure of reading his book is found in the lush descriptions of long lost nations and their exotic customs. His 'Histories' does not concern itself solely with history in the modern sense, but it is also a book of travelogue, ethnography, zoology, geography and botany. He is an excellent raconteur, almost always entertaining, except when he drones about speculative geography. We can easily imagine him, a man of seemingly inexhaustible curiosity, interviewing Marathon veterans for firsthand battle accounts, or interrogating Egyptian temple priests about their country’s history and religion. History for him is not a dry recitation of facts and dates, but an intensely human story acted by a vast cast of monarchs, queens, warriors, tyrants, gods and ordinary citizens. Regicides and rebellions are caused by personal passions, such as in the stories of Caudales and Gyges, and Xerxes and Masistes. Dreams compel Xerxes to invade Greece. Divine intervention decides the course of epic battles. A skein of tragedy runs through the historical drama that he narrates. The gods are so capricious and jealous that “one should not call a man happy until he is dead.” Xerxes, on beholding his massive force on the Hellespont, laments that “not one will be alive when a hundred years are gone by.” Yet while man lives his short existence he is capable of epic deeds, and Herodotus chronicled them all."

6051,Brother Juniper,Diane Gibfried,4.41,27,5,Kim,4,"This charming picture book tells the story of one of the friars in St Francis of Assisi's order. When the other brothers go out to preach, leaving Brother Juniper to watch over the chapel, he is so generous that they come back to find that he has given away EVERYTHING-- including the chapel doors and walls. They are angry at first, but come to realize how his actions have blessed the various recipients and, by extension, the entire congregation in their little village. The muted palette of the watercolor illustrations ties in well with the text, which is humorous and never didactic. A lovely story of generosity."

I really liked the description of frontier Idaho and how several prominent citizens took it from a rough town to some semblance of civilization.

It has to be one of the most awesomely bad books ever written. It's intended for children of course, but that doesn't make it any less terrible. It's some screwy adventure tale of two young sisters on a sinking ocean liner who end up alone in a life boat with two or three babies. IT'S LIKE A DREAM COME TRUE! The older sister is quite the mother hen, while the younger, butcher sister takes on the more masculine role of provider. She finds canned meat. They land on an Island and make a little home for themselves there. We were laughing so hard I almost ran off the road a few times. Its awful, and totally worth the read."
301,Treasure Island,Robert Louis Stevenson,3.82,315294,8081,Bookdragon Sean ,3,"Someone recently asked me what review I enjoyed writing the most, and, well, this is it:I have a massive problem with this book. It’s one I’m a little embarrassed to admit. The problem is not with the writing or the characters that Stevenson has created; it’s not even with the plot. The problem resides with Kermit the Frog. (Stay with me here!) I grew up watching the muppets. I became slightly obsessed with them. I kind of wanted to join them. So, whenever I read about Captain Smollett and Long John Silver all I can see is Kermit fighting Tim Curry! Therefore, I just can’t take this book seriously. Well, at least not completely. The Muppet Treasure Island is such a great film; it’s hilarious. This book was much more serious. The pirates in here aren’t singing toys; they’re hardened criminals that created the pirate stereotype. They’re the sort of men you don’t want on your ship because they’d likely cut your throat in your sleep. They might wake you up first if they’re feeling kind. So, they wouldn’t try and gain your trust by singing you a jolly song about piracy, like Tim and his muppet mates would. But, muppet based comparison aside, this is a good novel. I did quite enjoy it. It all begins when the young Jim Hawkins comes across a map for buried treasure, except he hasn’t got any money to fund the voyage. He  Gonzo and Rizzo goes alone and seeks the help of  Fozzie Bear  Squire Trelawney. As a member of the Victorian gentry, he takes the map for himself with the intention of filling his own coffers with the loot. He’s not a very nice  bear  guy, and he’s not overly intelligent either. In his frugality he accidently hires a group of twisted  muppets  pirates that, unsurprisingly, mutiny against him. This all sounds terrible, I know. But, it’s not all bad because the ship’s captain is none other than  Kermit the Frog  Captain Smollett who is absolutely in love with  Miss Piggy  no one. Indeed, Smollett is in direct contrast to the money driven  Fozzie  Trelawney because he is everything he is not; he is brave and honourable; he is completely true to his word. He is competing, unknowingly, for the attention of Jim. The young boy is looking for a farther figure, and in Silver and Smollett he sees two potential role models, and two potential life choices. It all works out in the end though because this is a  muppet movie adventure book after all. In all seriousness, it is an exciting book. But, for me, that’s all it is. There are no hidden motives or dark secrets. Everything is straight forward, clean cut and simple. It is a nice easy read. Stevenson’s masterpiece is most definitely  The Strange Case of Doctor Jekyll and Mr Hyde. That’s where the real mystery is at. But, it doesn’t have muppets….."

So, whenever I read about Captain Smollett and Long John Silver all I can see is Kermit fighting Tim Curry! Therefore, I just can’t take this book seriously. Well, at least not completely. The Muppet Treasure Island is such a great film; it’s hilarious. This book was much more serious. The pirates in here aren’t singing toys; they’re hardened criminals that created the pirate stereotype. They’re the sort of men you don’t want on your ship because they’d likely cut your throat in your sleep. They might wake you up first if they’re feeling kind. So, they wouldn’t try and gain your trust by singing you a jolly song about piracy, like Tim and his muppet mates would. But, muppet based comparison aside, this is a good novel. I did quite enjoy it. It all begins when the young Jim Hawkins comes across a map for buried treasure, except he hasn’t got any money to fund the voyage. He  Gonzo and Rizzo goes alone and seeks the help of  Fozzie Bear  Squire Trelawney. As a member of the Victorian gentry, he takes the map for himself with the intention of filling his own coffers with the loot. He’s not a very nice  bear  guy, and he’s not overly intelligent either. In his frugality he accidently hires a group of twisted  muppets  pirates that, unsurprisingly, mutiny against him. This all sounds terrible, I know. But, it’s not all bad because the ship’s captain is none other than  Kermit the Frog  Captain Smollett who is absolutely in love with  Miss Piggy  no one. Indeed, Smollett is in direct contrast to the money driven  Fozzie  Trelawney because he is everything he is not; he is brave and honourable; he is completely true to his word. He is competing, unknowingly, for the attention of Jim. The young boy is looking for a farther figure, and in Silver and Smollett he sees two potential role models, and two potential life choices. It all works out in the end though because this is a  muppet movie adventure book after all. In all seriousness, it is an exciting book. But, for me, that’s all it is. There are no hidden motives or dark secrets. Everything is straight forward, clean cut and simple. It is a nice easy read. Stevenson’s masterpiece is most definitely  The Strange Case of Doctor Jekyll and Mr Hyde. That’s where the real mystery is at. But, it doesn’t have muppets….."

304,Daniel Deronda,George Eliot,3.82,19371,735,Kalliope,5," THE DIPTYCHThis novel was renewed my interest on how George Eliot wrote. I am highly tempted to read more about her and approach literary evaluations of her writing, but before I do so I want to read Adam Bede and Silas Marner and may be reread The Mill on the Floss.When I read Romola I considered GE’s cosmopolitanism and breath of knowledge. These elements are also present in Daniel Deronda but with an added edge. With Middlemarch it was the role of the narrator and the clear presence of the author that attracted me. In DD the voice of the writer is also clear but in less authorial fashion and, one suspects, speaking more often through her characters. What struck me most, and want to select for my review this time, is the structure of the novel. It is clearly divided in two. Clearly a diptych. Already MM seemed to me to consist of two parallel stories joined somewhat seamlessly in the middle. The study of provincial evolved around two foci, the doctor Lydgate and the illuminated Dorothea. Both idealists. The twists and turnings of the plot, however, managed to link the two stories creating a middle path in Middlemarch were these two different versions of dreamers confronted each other and helped each other in correcting their reflections.This double structure is again present in Daniel Deronda, GE’s last novel, but with a wider gap between the two panels. With almost separated frames the novel reads like a double portrait, or a diptych with two facing and complementary donors searching for an object of adoration that is however missing – for the Self is never in the other. The two subjects pursue their mirroring images and transverse their separating frames by engaging in dialogs and verbal encounters. The twists and turns of the plot this time do not fuse their separated worlds. Only their minds bridge the gap.Generally I do not discuss characters in my reviews, but I can't avoid it this time. In this novel, the two protagonists, the sitters in the double portrait, baffled me. Gwendolen (Gwen), potentially a highly irritating young woman, fascinated me because I thought she was such a modern character. I expected that young powerful women in today’s professional world, and who are not just capable and intelligent, but also beautiful—and I am thinking of top Wall street traders, or international lawyers of the type, of for example, Amal Aladdin--, must have a similar self-assurance and defiance and inner drive and independence and élan as Gwen. But even if these contemporary women have had a better chance to explore and exploit their abilities in their chosen fields of excellence than GE has allowed Gwen, she did not get on my nerves. I was enthralled by her modernity. Daniel, in spite of having claimed the title of the novel, remained for me an equivocal figure. It is almost as if in my diptych Daniel—with his messianic role turned around, for he is the Christian leading onto the Jewish— is a donor who through a process of transubstantiation has become the object of adoration.And in that transformation, the novel dims and blurs its cast of characters and becomes more and more an exploration of ideas, spirituality and politics, with a defence of Judaism and a daring proposal of Zionism. In all this Daniel emerges as an ethereal saviour but poor Gwen succumbs and loses her leading edge.And that is what made me wonder about how GE wrote her books and planned her work in her mind. Did she spend half of her day doing intellectual research on the subjects that captivated her and did she then transcribe her reading into her novel in the afternoons? What was her true objective, to expand her erudition, or to mould it into something else?I will have to put aside my curiosity for a while and continue reading her work, but with her intelligent writing and formidable abilities she certainly makes me ponder about the process of writing, that elusive act - creativity. How is it born and how does it live?And how did Rothko paint the above diptych?"

Laiken,4.01,2973,99,Trevor,5,"Rules for writing a great book:Someone near and dear needs to die.There can be no going back – it is crash through or crash time.Some of the good guys have to have near fatal flaws – some of the bad guys need to be damn charming. Oh Long John Silver, what a great character.Mortal danger – lots and lots of mortal danger.And the most frightening character in the book needs to be someone who would normally be the least frightening. No wonder Tom Waits talks about the tap, tap, tap of a blind man’s cane – I just didn’t realise he was quoting Stevenson.What a romp, what a read, what a book. What a pity I waited until I was 45 to read it.In high school, when I was a bit obsessed with Lord of the Flies I was told that book was based on this book. What seems virtually certain is that they are both set on the same island. I should go back and double check at some stage."
3342,The Big Oyster: History on the Half Shell,Mark Kurlansky,3.9,2830,342,Jason Koivu,4,"The title of The Big Oyster: History on the Half Shell is a nod to The Big Apple and could very well be considered a solid stand-alone history of New York itself. Mark Kurlansky's book titles do not get the reader's blood pumping: SaltNonviolenceCodYou'd half expect to fall asleep before finishing the intro. But keep pushing on and you'll find a highly enjoyable read filled with interesting facts. Seriously, Kurlansky can make oysters and cod interesting. That's impressive!The Big Oyster takes us through the history of the oyster, its life cycle, its biology and its importance to mankind.*That last topic mainly focuses on North America's relationship with the oyster and more specifically New York city's, for Manhattan and this particular shellfish are particularly linked in growth and decline. It doesn't seem to matter if you're a Wall Street fat-cat or a loincloth-wearing native, humans used and abused the little buggers. Though I enjoyed the detailed descriptions of both (with a great section on the ""Gangs Of New York"" Five Points area), it's the whens, hows, wheres, and what fors that make truly make The Big Oyster a fascinatingly good read!* FUN FACT: Did you know pearls do not come from oysters?"
3806,Creative Correction: Extraordinary Ideas For Everyday Discipline,Lisa Whelchel,3.9,1040,94,Becki,3,"My sister-in-law actually recommended this book to me when we were discussing parenting. \nThe copy I read was from the library. However, it is on my �to buy� list. While I got some ideas just through reading it, I would love to have it on the shelf to pull out and look up specific behaviors and corresponding consequences. Or even corresponding Scriptures. Lisa Whelchel does a great job of have Scriptures with most of her corrections (or rewards). And as a parent trying to raise her kiddos to love God and follow Him, I think that is important.\nJeff read it too. Our biggest take-away that we�ve implement so far is the �chore jar.� You know, sometimes there isn�t a consequence that fits the crime. Or there are ongoing infractions of the same rule. That�s when they visit the chore jar to pick a chore to do. These are the chores are bigger than their weekly chores. They are the things that need to be done but we never get around to doing (i.e. cleaning all the baseboard in the house, weeding/winterizing the flower beds). So the girls get to do them. \nThere is an added benefit to the chore jar. Our girls are both saving up money toward a goal. So we�ve assigned dollar values to each of the chore jar chores. Of course, if they are doing an extra chore as a discipline, they don�t get paid. however, if one of them has some extra time and wants to do an extra chore for extra money, we don�t have to think of one on the spot. They just pull from the jar.\nI think this book would be a worthwhile resource for any parent � but especially for those trying to parent from a Godly worldview.\nFascinating Fact: Lisa Whelchel was Blaire on the T.V. show Facts of Life."
3341,Nonviolence: Twenty-Five Lessons from the History of a Dangerous Idea,Mark Kurlansky,3.99,894,125,James,5,"This book was absolutely captivating.The history of non-violence is unrepresented in our educational system. In fact, it is quite the opposite: our educational system presents history almost entirely as a progression of violent acts.Kurlansky's book is remarkable for several reasons. It is a fascinating, lucid account of the non-violence movement throughout history, most of which we have never before encountered. His writing is excellent - clear and concise, and yet descriptive. And the story is so engaging it draws you in like a fiction novel.Kurlansky contrasts the non-violence movement from that of the pacifist's. Gandhi was in fact antagonistic to the inaction in pacifism. Kurlansky quotes Ghandi, ""Violence is any day preferable to impotence. There is hope for the violent man to become non-violent. There is no such hope for the impotent."" As you read this book, you become aware of the incredible bravery of those in the active non-violence movement. As one non-violent leader was quoted as saying, it requires far more bravery to be an active non-violent protestor than a warrior.Some of the writings from the non-violent movement of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries are amazingly powerful. It makes one wonder how we could still be fighting wars in the twenty-first century. I can only think it is because we have leaders who lack imagination, intelligence, and yes; bravery.I believe every teenager should have this book as required reading.I rarely keep books. After I have read them, I put them out in to the world for others to enjoy. This book I will keep and read again many times. I would put it in my top ten of all time. Along with ""All Is Quiet On The Western Front"", it is a cry to humanity to stop the madness of war."
9483,"Open Society and Its Enemies, Volume 2: The High Tide of Prophecy: Hegel, Marx, and the Aftermath",Karl R. Popper,4.03,1603,58,Clif,5,"This is the second volume of Popper's work that warns of the great influence of thinkers who were no friends of the open society, a society in which the rights of the individual are valued over the glory of the state.In volume one, Popper uses Plato's writings, quoted extensively, to indict Plato very effectively as an advocate of totalitarianism. In this volume, it is Hegel and Marx that are up on charges of abandoning reason for historicism, Popper's term for a mythological belief that there is a force directing the course of societies that dictates their fate and, by extension, allows prophecy about what societies will come.Historicism defeats effort. Why should you and I do anything when the lessons of the past dictate an inevitable future, for better or worse? The future will be inevitably worse, part of the predictable degeneration from the original ideal thought Plato, a pessimist, while Hegel and Marx, optimists, thought improvement was the rule.Hegel is all but entirely dismissed by Popper as a pretentious windbag writing difficult if not unintelligible prose about a world spirit moving through the ages coming to fruition in the the glorious Prussian monarchy by which Hegel was employed to philosophize for the state. For him, there is no higher calling for the individual than to be of service to the state.Marx, on the other hand, is given a significant amount of credit by Popper for being a very observant, insightful analyst of capitalism as it had developed up to the time at which Marx wrote his magnum opus, Capital (1867). Where Marx falls down, Popper writes, is in his prediction of the inevitable demise of capitalism at the feet of the proletariat (the working people) and his far too simplistic view of society as composed of only two classes, the workers and the bourgeoisie (the employers/capitalists). This mystical view of the future turned out to be wrong. The most obvious reason for the error is that Marx could not foresee the power of labor, through democracy, to impose restrictions on capitalism, taming it for a while.Popper's reasoning here, written in 1962, fails to see the power of capitalism to come roaring back in our time to essentially dismantle all of the reforms (and the unions) that restrained it, doing so through the corruption of democracy by unrestricted campaign funding that empowers the corporate lobbies. But this doesn't detract from Popper's argument, he would never claim to be able to predict the future.As powerful as volume 1 was in explaining the writing of Plato for the layman, volume 2 is even more powerful in explaining the voluminous writing of Marx, not in detail but in the fundamental ideas that Marx was attempting to relate to his readers. Thanks to Popper, I have never understood the basis of Marx' work as well as I do now, nor the atmosphere of the time in which Marx wrote that so forcefully directed his thoughts. This book is well worth reading for two reasons.The first is that Popper demonstrates the power of reason in the careful way he writes and the distance he goes to provide evidence for his thinking. This work is most of all a defense of reason. Popper is adamant that for reason to work, ideas must be able to contend for approval. Argument is vital. Advance comes only out of disputes that are resolved on evidence, concerning society this means the evidence found from ""piecemeal engineering"" where society is exposed to change in one small area at a time and the result is seen to be beneficial or not. Never will some grand plan for a new society work because it can never account for the many errors in detail and the internal contradictions that will defeat it. In the face of unavoidable problems with a grand plan, it will end up imposed no matter what, meaning heads will roll to take care of opposition (see the French Revolution). This is exactly the opposite of a just society that values the individual.The second reason to read this book is to get a solid grip on Marx, a man Popper feels was a humanitarian at heart, honestly eager to advance the cause of the virtually helpless multitudes of the mid 19th century. Though Marx was a believer in reason he was unable to hold to it, falling victim to a view of inevitable social change in a specific way that would follow his prophesy. That prophesy, thoroughly discredited by events since his time, has unfortunately led most to make the error of dismissing his work entirely.As for Popper's writing, a high school student would have no trouble following the logic and just might learn the power of logic in the process."

FUCK, life is so full of crap.there is one good thing in my life though. just read this book Catcher in the Rye. blown away! i don't know how a book written decades ago could say exactly what i would say. it is like the author was reading my thoughts and put it all down in this book. things i didn't even realize i felt were right there on the page! I LOVED IT. i think this is my favorite novel of all time. which is not saying a whole lot because there is a ton of pretentious bullshit out there and i bet mrs. durham will force us to read it all. man i hate that bitch.journal entrytoday i am 20 years old. life is great as usual. just enjoyed my wednesday morning wake-and-bake session with j-p, the sun is shining, the san diego weather is beautiful, and tonight i'm off to rob & gregg's to destroy them at bullshit. love that game! gregg says that joelle will be there (yes!) but she'll probably bring that prick pete with her. one of these days i'm going to lose it and kick his ass. ""i'm in a band""...fuck you, pete! i will never spin your records.all i have on the agenda today is to go to the gym and then off to keracik's american lit class. it is not a bad class, although it is nowhere close to gender studies with halberstam. or davidoff's survey of modern postmodernism last semester. now that was a class! it blew my mind. so many things to think about. the reading in american lit has been okay. but we've been assigned to read Catcher in the Rye and it is terrible. can't believe i ever liked this book. caulfield is a whiny little bitch. the book has no depth. there is literally nothing going on with the narrative, style, theme, characterization, it is just one rote cliché after another. he thinks he is such a rebel-without-a-cause but in reality he is just another tired representation of rootless, stereotypical masculinity and gender essentialism. completely inane and without meaning. i think my essay will use some acker-style postmodernist techniques to show how simplistic this trite ""classic"" truly is. i'm going to deconstruct the shit out of this novel, baby!journal entrytoday i am 25 years old. another gray, drizzly san francisco morning. i wish christopher would wake up, i really need to talk to him after all that shit last night. notes on my pillow, really?? time to grow up dude, i will never ""complete you"". well actually i'm glad he's still asleep, my throat is too sore to get into it right now with him. plus Food Not Bombs is happening this morning and i have to get the kitchen ready. john is probably hard at work already, typical over-achieving behavior. i bet the wisconsin kids are still crashing on our living room floor. it's time for them to leave! they've seen The Vindictives at every single Epicenter or Gilman show now and it is time for them to hit the road. or learn to take a shower. this apartment is not the world's crashpad!i woke up early this morning and thumbed through A Catcher in the Rye. i remember hating this book in college for some reason. probably wasn't po-mo enough for me. or ""challenging"". feh. what a pretentious idiot i was. this is a beautiful book. it changed my life as a kid, i'm not sure how i would have survived orange county without it. just re-reading parts of it brought back all that old angst about all the fucked-up shit in the world that kids have to deal with. i'm not sure there is another book as insightful or as meaningful. or funny! that part with the clipping-of-the-toenails is hilarious. ackley is such a douche. this book is the foundation of every zine that i have ever loved. a perfect novel. it is so....""human"", i guess.journal entrytoday i am 30 years old. man my head hurts...so hungover! my birthday party last night was awesome. even got to spend some time on the turntables (thanks kraddy for actually relinquishing a tiny bit of control for once). i must have made out with a half-dozen people. sadly, no real action. i think last night's party will be the last big party i will ever throw. things have got to change. no more partying like the world is about to end, i still have my entire life ahead of me! tomorrow i am going to go into AIG and hand in my notice. i am not an entertainment insurance underwriter, that is not me. fuck them. if erika can get me that job working with homeless kids at Hospitality House, than i am set. although moving from the biggest room in the flat to the water heater closet will be no fun. i'm 30 years old now for chrissakes! still, i've got to do something meaningful with my life. it cannot all be about booze, drugs, hooking up, and paying everyone's rent when they're broke. things have got to change.i cracked open A Catcher in the Rye yesterday before the party and read some of my favorite parts. what an inspiration! seriously, that is a classic novel. it is packed with meaning. i'm twice caulfield's age but i still somehow connect with him in a very direct way. my life is going to change and the attitude expressed in that book is at the heart of that change. i love you, holden caulfied. it's not too late for me to learn from you, to find some meaning in life.journal entrytoday i am 35 years old. another intense, sad, but deeply fulfilling week has passed. every day something meaningful happens, something so emotional and real. sometimes i find myself just losing it in a fetal position because of the things i've seen. working with people who are drug addicted or who have been abused or who are dying is HEAVY. but it is also beautiful. it's hard to believe i am dealing with all of that and supporting my folks too. thank God i have good friends to talk to about these things. anyway. so now marcy wants to have a kid. i just don't know how i feel about that. this is such a fucked up world, do we really want to bring new life into it? i dunno. it seems....selfish, somehow. she should just quit her job with the d.a.'s office and get back to her roots in the public defender's office instead. does she think that having a child with me will bring more meaning into her life? my life has meaning enough already. and i really am not sure i can handle that responsibility on top of everything else.i skimmed A Catcher in the Rye yesterday, after an awkward talk with marcy about having a baby. it was not an inspiring read. caulfield is so full of misplaced angst! i'm not sure i even understand him anymore. why is he so pissed off? he's seen nothing of the world and what the world can actually do to people. i want to like him, i want to re-capture that feeling of affection i had for him, but now his contempt and his anger just seem so meaningless, so naive. he really does not have it so bad. there is so much worse out there. i don't know how i would handle a kid like that. i hate to say it, but i constantly rolled my eyes when reading it. oh the emotional self-absorption of youth! just you wait, caulfield. it sure gets a hell of a lot more complicated once you grow up.journal entrytoday i am 40 years old. when did i become a boss? it is like i woke up one day, mysteriously transformed into an old man. am i really a ""leader""? what does that even mean? sometimes i feel like i am just faking it all and someone is going to figure it out and blow the whistle on me. last week i made a huge play on the Council, i had all my ducks in a row, and all the votes came in just as i had planned. everyone has their own agenda and the way to get things done is simply to recognize and engage with that disappointing fact. some folks got up and started clapping and then the whole room joined in, even council members who voted against my motion - feh, phonies. the experience was sort of amazing but it also made me feel very odd, almost disconnected from myself. is this who i am now, a public policy figure, a community advocate, a mayoral appointee? ugh, i can't stand the mayor. i don't feel like me. there is accomplishment there, and some satisfaction... but i am missing something, something visceral, something real. sweet Jesus, is this what a mid-life crisis feels like? it is a weird feeling, like i know everything that i need to know about the world, about the people around me, how everything connects, but yet i still feel like i know so little about life. oh, such angst, mark. surely you've outgrown this?i've started re-reading A Catcher in the Rye. it's so strange, during different parts, i felt like crying. a wonderful and moving novel. i feel like i really understand holden, like he is my guide, my son, my brother, my friend... myself. i think of him and i know that change in the world and changing myself can still happen. it just has to happen. that's life after all, right?"
9484,"Within a Budding Grove (In Search of Lost Time, #2)",Marcel Proust,4.4,7184,543,Renato Magalhães Rocha,5,"I've long debated with myself - and friends - the actual benefits of re-reading versus a fresh read of a new book. Would re-reading really bring me a considerable number of new reflections, ideas and opinions to add to the first impressions I've gathered on my first read? And wouldn't this time spent on this repeated task be better employed by reading a completely different book that would instead and therefore give me completely different reflections on different subjects I perhaps haven't touched yet? In short: would a re-read prove effective considering time spent and rewards obtained?For being in the middle of a serious Proustmania - obsession, really - I decided to re-read all of the volumes of his Recherche, even having questioned so much and for so long the advantages of a re-read. Well, in addition to everything else which I'll address along this review, this rexperience came to show me that, for some books, a re-read is extremely beneficial - if not almost required -, especially in the case of a very long novel, with intricate plot, underlying motifs and interconnections that are impossible not only to absorb - but also to notice - on a first read. ""Thus it can be only after one has recognised, not without having had to feel one's way, the optical illusions of one's first impression that one can arrive at an exact knowledge of another person, supposing such knowledge to be ever possible. But it is not; for while our original impression of him undergoes correction, the person himself, not being an inanimate object, changes in himself, we think that we have caught him, he moves, and, when we imagine that at last we are seeing him clearly, it is only the old impressions which we had already formed of him that we have succeeded in making clearer, when they no longer represent him.""In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower starts off by addressing one of Proust's most important beliefs - and a theme that will recurrently permeate his narrative: that what we understand to be someone, how we perceive and describe them, expect them to be, are merely an effort of our own intelligence into molding all of the characteristics we've been shown and seen through our own perception into an sculpture we believe to be a fully functional person. In order to develop his point, it seems the second volume makes a case of confusing us: majestic Swann is described as someone of little prestige while buffoon Dr. Cottard is a must-have guest in any respectable dinner party. Surely the writer confused their names after such a long hiatus between volumes?A l'ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs was only released in 1919, a good six years after the first volume was published due to the Great War. This time, however, Proust wasn't to pay for the publication costs and the book would even win the prestigious Prix Goncourt award, making him widely known and appreciated not only in France, but also across Europe.The changes we observe in characters' reputations and actions are not exclusively confined to Swann and Dr. Cottard. Besides them, we also learn of M. Norpois and how his political views evolved over time. Just in the first twenty pages or so of this volume, the writer already sends us the clear message that people and their status are never set in stone and prepares us to a big roller-coaster ride when it comes to his characters (and that will last throughout all of the volumes). Proust's treatment of his personages feels like a superposition of a multitude of layers constituted of their past beings with the addition of the most current state at that particular time, which, granted, is only at the surface for a brief period, shortly being covered by yet another fresh and new layer that is for its turn as expirable as the previous one. This constant shift is, of course, accompanied by his narrator's - and our own - which follows the same pattern and, with these ever changing subjects, arises a million possibilities as to what will happen every time a character reappears, thus making Proust's creations always exciting and never predictable.In addition to the conditions mentioned above - of a person's own interior alterations and how our perception of those is in constant transformation as well - there is the question of change of reputation by association. Being someone respected and admired in the most prestigious and intimate circles of the Parisian society wasn't enough to keep Swann from having his esteem considerably downgraded after his marriage to Odette, like those chemical elements that form a good substance while associated with hydrogen and are poisonous while in a chemical reaction with lead. Following this pattern, other characters will go up and down in the social scale depending on whom they're associated with, and also accompanying their respective ups and downs.Just like the characters change depending on the point of view they're being observed from - much like the narrator's description of the Martinville steeples and their positions in relation to each other while on his car trip -, certain events on the plot also do so. Seemingly insignificant little moments - such as an insistent look from someone, a face expression, a phrase that appears to be innocently said in the midst of a longer dialogue or even a statement surrounded by a lengthy digression from the narrator that could be overlooked - retroactively take on a huge importance when analyzed from another perspective (even if that only comes 500 or 600 pages later) and one can't help to admire Proust's skillful incorporation of such ""little details"" that make his future events feel natural once they're fully developed, just as in life, where things certainly don't appear to us classified by importance - or even by the future importance they'll attain in our lives - and always in the right order. This is one of the characteristics that make his writing so organic and lifelike and what, at the same time, may be perceived as boring for some readers.Still on the subject of how an event from one volume is important and brought to life again on a subsequent volume, we continue to witness how the narrator is incapable to control his nervous impulses - an inability that was first exposed to us in the goodnight kiss drama from Swann's Way - and easily gives in to his impulses even though he's fully aware of the consequences. Only this time such matters are related to love: his ungovernable need to establish a love connection with Gilberte and to receive it back from her makes him go to such lengths and to scheme manipulations that could be easily attributed to a sociopath. Besides the aforementioned connection to the previous volume, these pages are also connected to a subsequent one, anticipating in hundreds of pages his behavior and conduct he's to develop later in another relationship.But back to the concerned volume, while Charles Swann is no longer a renowned gentleman, he still greatly influences the narrator's life, as the falling gent seems to be the one who drives our hero to accomplish those that were mere dreams in his mind when it came to places he wanted to visit: it's because of Swann and his mention of how Bergotte (the narrator's favorite writer) admires Berma that our pupil develops his obsession with the theatre and the great actress; it's also Swann who invites him to enter the much anticipated Gilberte's world and her mother's salon life (his first one) and, to conclude the dream trinity, his trip to Balbec was rekindled in his desires after a comment made by Charles about the roman cathedral in that beach. While Swann's and the Guermantes ways were still separate paths to the narrator, it was through Swann that he was able to enter the Guermantes way, for was in Balbec (following Swann's recommendation) that he eventually met important characters that lived in that still obscure world. It is precisely because of this trip that the narrator embarked on that we can also call this volume a book of firsts: the first time he meets people from the Guermantes clan; the first time he meets the artist - Elstir - that will influence his life and art so much; and the first time he sees the young girls in flower. All events that might seem like random plot directions but that, in the future, come together to form an unity. After much longing in the first volume, the narrator finally makes a trip he's been anticipating for so long, and what a trip! Not only the change of scenery was a breath of fresh air, providing us a warm beach breeze, after the cloistered feeling that came from the first chapter (Madame Swann at Home), but this second part (Place-Names: The Place) depicts a major life changing experience: while I was reading this chapter for the second time, it hit me how much of the future developments comes from this single summer trip, like one of those occasions in life where you stop and analyze what could've been if this or that event never happened, if you never went to such place or never met a certain person; you're left with no clue as to who you'd be if not for that, almost like being born in a different time, country or family would make you a different person than you are now. In such a supple time in one's life - adolescence - where even going to a different school and bonding with other friends could design a different personality, imagine (and it really requires a powerful imagination to picture that) if you hadn't met three of the most important people - aside family - of your life. Aside the place and the people - or maybe because of them -, it's also at that time that the narrator stars playing with his theories and philosophies about life and art.And now that I've mentioned 'art', I suppose it's time to talk about Elstir. Proust's brilliance in not only conceiving a fully realized painter - when he himself wasn't one - but also in developing and depicting his talents so precisely as if he actually existed impressed me so much. The way he described Elstir's painting talents is in complete relation with his own literary ones: while Proust makes use of involuntary memories (those sensations that are already in us, but that we can't recover through intelligence alone or we risk distorting them), Elstir makes use of involuntary first impressions (those visions that appear to us right before we make use of intelligence to recognize them properly and to fit them to a pattern); the difference being that Proust is revisiting a memory after it settled into his consciousness, and Elstir is painting a vision before it does so. Both artists try to isolate a singular true feeling, removing all rationalization that we've been programmed to attack with every unknown sensation that comes our way, like our white blood cells fighting foreign invaders.It seems Marcel Proust and James Joyce will remain forever linked in my mind - they who only met once and had never read each other's works (although Joyce later admitted he had read parts of Swann's Way), and who are so far apart in their writing techniques, but that to me stand so close, not just because I read them at the same time last year (and now continue to do so as I'm re-reading the Recherche and the James Joyce biography by Richard Ellmann), but also because, having stated before that I wasn't much of a visual person while reading - that is, I could never really form a fixed image of what the writer was describing, I wasn't able to build that room and enter it in my imagination, only blindly feel the sensations the words awakened in me - after reading Joyce's Dubliners, began to be a little more creative in that aspect. So another positive aspect of re-reading is that we're able to approach the same text while provided with new tools to delve into it that we've acquired ever since finishing it the first time. While I was re-reading this second volume, I could picture what Proust meant when he described not only the sea and the sun and the landscapes his narrator envisioned outside of his window, but also even Elstir's paintings, which only existed in his mind. And the whole section the narrator spent in the painter's atelier that bored me a bit on my first read for I could not envision any of the described images, now became gorgeous and alive as if he actually removed the white sheets that were covering them.
  ""And our dread of a future in which we must forego the sight of faces, the sound of voices that we love, friends from whom we derive today our keenest joys, this dread, far from being dissipated, is intensified, if to the grief of such a privation we reflect that there will be added what seems to us now in anticipation an even more cruel grief; not to feel it as a grief at all—to remain indifferent; for if that should occur, our ego would have changed, it would then be not merely the attractiveness of our family, our mistress, our friends that had ceased to environ us, but our affection for them; it would have been so completely eradicated from our heart, in which today it is a conspicuous element, that we should be able to enjoy that life apart from them the very thought of which today makes us recoil in horror; so that it would be in a real sense the death of ourselves, a death followed, it is true, by resurrection but in a different ego, the life, the love of which are beyond the reach of those elements of the existing ego that are doomed to die.""
Taking this review a bit to the personal side, one of the reasons this volume specifically resonated so deeply with me was due to the developed theories about loss and forgetting that Proust attributed to his narrator when he was obsessing about the end of his love for Gilberte or even for Albertine, but that can generally be used in the context of getting over someone - even with whom no romantic link is involved - that's gone away. I've always had a little trouble with that future when someone that is now so important, so vital, so present in my daily activities, simply won't be missed because time - and habit - will have worked their magic in making me comfortable with the new situation. As paradoxical as it can be - suffering because of a future time where we won't be suffering and fearing to forget exactly that which we won't remember -, it feels like an actual loss and it gets to me every time; whenever I changed schools, changed cities, changed jobs, I mourned about those friendships that I knew would cool down because of what would come from such situations.I find it mesmerizing how Proust was able to write like that in a work of fiction (of course there's a lot of himself here and the very ideas he's developed his entire life), but for someone not currently experiencing all the situations while writing his book, it's pretty impressive how he could take a moment to dissect just about every possible feeling so well. And when you find yourself - or rather a piece of you - so masterfully depicted in a work of art, being thoroughly analyzed, looked at from every possible angle, considering all hypothesis and implications, you can't help but to consider it a tool to mirror life and to understand yourself better and to highly value it.Rating: for a volume that stands on its own and gets better on second read, without losing its initial charm, but becoming even more interesting, and therefore strengthening in my not only my decision, but also my will to keep re-reading: 5 stars.-------For my re-reading experience of the entire À la recherche du temps perdu:Vol 1.

9634,From the Dust Returned,Ray Bradbury,3.76,3664,334,Jean,4,"Have you ever watched the TV programme ""The Addams Family""? A strange way to start a book review, perhaps, but bear with me and all will become clear. Charles Addams was an American cartoonist and comic strip artist known for his black humour and macabre characters. His work regularly appeared in The New Yorker, where according to a biographer, he was ""drawing with a happy vengeance"". Ray Bradbury is a master story-teller, a science-fiction writer whose works are without fail extraordinary flights of the imagination. They met in 1946, and the rest, as they say, is history.In his twenties Ray Bradbury wrote a short story entitled ""Homecoming"". It was to be the first in a series of tales chronicling a family named the Elliotts. But this was no ordinary family. Yes, they were loyal and loving, with great hearts and compassion, as families should be. But they were a strange outlandish family, comprised of ghosts and unnamed supernatural creatures, who all lived in Illinois, in the Mid-Western United States. Charles Addams painted a two-page spread to illustrate ""Homecoming"", which was published in the October 1946 issue of ""Mademoiselle"" magazine. Although ""Homecoming"" had been rejected several times, this time the editors enthusiastically decided to change the magazine to fit the story, and based the whole issue around it. The pair, Bradbury and Addams, became friends and planned to collaborate on a book of the Elliott Family's complete history with Bradbury writing and Addams providing the illustrations, but it never materialized. From then on, their two paths diverged. In an interview, Bradbury stated that Addams, ""went his way and created the Addams Family and I went my own way and created my family in this book."" ""The Addams Family"" became a huge success, both on television and films, and in cartoon and book form. However, it is a very different beast from Bradbury's. Addams heightened the humour and populist treatment; Bradbury's stories about the Elliott family kept the wry macabre humour, but were by turns lyrical, wistful, poignant, and chilling. ""From the Dust Returned"" then, is Bradbury's created novel from 2001, about the immortal family. The author developed six of his short stories written over a fifty-five year period. All of the stories had appeared in magazines, and some also in previous anthologies, so the reader may well have a feeling of deja-vu whilst reading this novel. If anything this adds to the dreamlike feel characteristic of all Bradbury's writing. The cover illustration to the book is the original one by Charles Addams, created to accompany the first story. Sadly Addams never saw this novel; he died in 1988. Interspersed in the text are small line drawings of spiders, cats, tombs, skeletons and suchlike, to enhance the mood. The previously published six stories are interwoven with newer chapters and lyrical prose passages, connecting to make a unique atmospheric patchwork of a most peculiar clan.""They hollowed, they lingered, they roared down and wafted up... the shapeless and invisible winds... carrying the semblance of their old weather with them. And if they had names at all it was monsoon or sirocco or santana... hurricanes flung hopeless... or flurried south with freezing breaths to meet the breaths of fire that moved intemperately across the Gulf.""Bradbury says that his initial inspiration for the Elliott family dates back to his childhood, and the Halloweens he spent at his grandmother's house. This resulted in the first short story, ""Homecoming."" He then published five further stories about the Elliotts.They have lived for centuries in a house of legend and mystery. Nobody except the family know where it is, and they preserve its secret location ferociously. Rarely encountered in daylight hours, the family's children are strange and wild; all supernatural creatures of the night save one - Timothy - the human foundling son they feel sorry for and adopt. He is considered to be abnormal by them as his face reflects in a mirror; a perfect example of Bradbury's trademark ghoulish wit. Ironically it is Timothy who is the poignant character in this weird tale, for it is he who carries the burden of time on his shoulders. The family are right; he is strange. He is unique. For unlike them, one day he must age and die. This series of interconnected stories, uses a device Bradbury has used before, notably in ""The Illustrated Man"". In this case the linking character is A Thousand Times Great Grandmère, the family matriarch. She is the mother of Nefertiti, and she and Grandfather have survived since before the Sphinx in Egypt. She speaks pronouncements; lyrical passages from deep within her mummified wrappings. She speaks about the old ones, and of millennia gone by,""a captive of time, her eyes slits of deep blue lapis lazuli behind thread-sewn lids, a glitter of remembrance as her mouth, with a shriveled tongue wormed in it, whistled and sighed and whispered to recall every hour of every lost night four thousand years back"" The main character is Cecy, ""the one who dreams,"" a young girl yearning for love who can experience the world only through the travels of her mind as she flies high in the consciousness of bird, or bat... or human. There is Uncle Einar, a fun-loving, proud-winged vampire who loses his ability to fly. There is Tom, a farm boy whom Cecy ""meets"" and falls in love with one night during one of her spirit-borne journeys. Throughout the stories, there is growing tension as the house is being got ready for the gala homecoming that will gather together the farflung branches of the family, whether shapeshifter, telepath, somnambulist or vampire. But in the midst of eager anticipation, there is a sense of doom. For the world is changing. And it is Timothy who must find a way to resolve it. The ending... well it is unexpected. Afterwards the reader has a great sense of loss, but also a sense of inevitability.This novel shows Ray Bradbury's powerful vision and imagination. The single human representative of the Elliott family is a very far cry from the human ""stooge"" of the Addams family. But then from the initial conception has developed something touching, wistful and strange, at times reading like liquid poetry.A critic once stated, ""Ray Bradbury is Edgar Allan Poe for optimists."" A good description of this book, perhaps? Here's a taste,""And what are you, or we, or us? Can it be named?...Are we kin to Autumn rains? Do we rise in mists from wetland moors? Do twilight fogs seem similar? Do we prowl or run or lope? Are we shadows on a ruined wall?...Do we hover or fly or writhe...? Are we footsteps heard to waken us and bump our skulls on nailed-shut lids? Are we batwing heartbeats held in claw or hand or teeth?...Do we abide in walls as mortuary beetles telling time?...Do we sleep by day and swarm-glide the splendid night? When Autumn leaves shower bullions are we that Midas stuff, a leaf-fall that sounds the air in crisp syllables? What, what, oh what  are we?"""
7906,"Emily of Deep Valley (Deep Valley, #2)",Maud Hart Lovelace,4.23,2533,171,E.L.,5,"There were two books that sustained me the most during my first year of marriage - a year when everything was changing, I had moved away from everything and everyone I knew, and I was post-school but pre-job or -kids, when my new husband was working long hours and I had huge spaces of time just by myself, wondering what my purpose was. One book was The Blue Castle, by LM Montgomery. The other was this book, Emily of Deep Valley. The questions and struggles Emily endured, the feeling of something ended without something else starting, the need to ""muster her wits"" and make her own path ... it all provided such encouragement and hope to my lonely soul!I love that Emily's love story is secondary to her own self-discovery, that it provides a counterpoint to the lessons she is learning throughout her ""lost year"" but does not overshadow them. I love that Lovelace is not afraid to go against tradition - we are never sure if her heroines are going to end up with their first loves or with somebody new (in Lovelace's world, Anne Shirley and Roy Gardiner might very well have ended up more suitable to each other than Anne and Gilbert, shocking though that may seem!). I love that throughout everything she does is a thread of love and devotion to her grandfather, and never once is it suggested that she is wasting her life by staying with him. And I have to admit, I love all the descriptions of the clothes from back then!It is an old-fashioned story, but Emily is a heroine for all ages."
8693,West Africa,Lonely Planet,3.63,70,6,Tinea,4,"I've only ""thoroughly"" explored this for Mali and Senegal, and for a guide book it's great. Things in every backwater that surely cannot have a thing to see or do, reliable and varied food suggestions, and sleeping on every budget. You really can do all your planning directly out of a Lonely Planet guide, which I knew already and really appreciate. Their 3-day, 1-week, 2-week, etc prioritized itineraries are spot on, and I taught myself basic getting-around Amharic out of the language guide for Ethiopia a few years ago. What inspired me to write a review of this book, however, was when my partner and I were sitting around a table in the Siné-Saloum Delta in Senegal and he started reading the short country histories at the start of each chapter. In the span of an hour or two of reading and talking, he--someone who had never studied West Africa or read much about it, on is first visit to the region-- got a thorough introduction to the people, cultures, art, colonial histories, and recent wars of a large handful of individual countries, each given space and depth, respect in its turn. Impressed, I read the 150 pages of background materials in the front and back of the book, and will try to read the introductions to the rest of the West African countries (years studying and some time living in the region and I still know nothing about Togo except that Mali's football team should and can crush them). Overview-level but such a diverse choice of information to summarize, and a million book recommendations for further reading on everything (including photo books for art and a ton of literature I've never heard of, which proved very helpful in the African Lit section of a Dakar bookstore as I stared at a wall of West African authors and was overwhelmed by the newly accesessible francophone world opening up because of improving language skills and the plummeting sadness of the lack of good bookstores [that I've heard of] in Bamako, which is what 'imports' are for, I guess, thank you Senegal vacay!). My only complaint is the health section, where they chose to list off a terrifying array of tropical diseases at the expense of foregrounding the basic but vital actions one can take to avoid and treat most of them at once. I would have moved the health section to the front, as well, since travelers could easily miss it tucked in the back but you really should not attempt travel in West Africa without a solid understanding of the mechanisms of spread of water- and food-born illnesses and malaria.Overall, it's just really well done, much more than a travel guide, this book enables you to be informed, culturally sensitive, and adventurous without being totally blind."
624,The Automatic Millionaire Homeowner,David Bach,3.81,1073,76,David,1,"My attention to detail skill was absent when I bought this audiobook on iTunes. I wanted The Automatic Millionaire, but bought the Real Estate version by accident. While I still want to go back and read that book, I cannot recommend this particular book. Bach begins by stating the stock market cannot produce the returns of real estate. His disclaimer is the book is written in 2006, so some things may change when the reader goes through it. He mentions his methods are timeless because everyone needs a home. He discusses building wealth through borrowing other people's money. While he spend 12 chapters talking about building a portfolio of real estate, he does not adequately discuss risks invovled. I give him credit for stating that ""get-rich quick"" does not work and that the reader should take tiime to build their real estate wealth. This is because the home is one of our most valuable investments. I just cannot begin to agree with his methods of using debt to build wealth. If you read the Total Money Makeover by Dave Ramsey and you want to know what this book talks about, then here's what you will find. Take most of Dave's principles and do the opposite. If you go this route to build wealth, keep Dave Ramsey's phone number ready to call when the banks start calling in your notes. I'll take financial peace over wealth with debt any day."

In the US version of the third novel of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Life, the Universe and Everything, the word 'Belgium' is used to replace the word ""fuck"" which was in the British publication.Apparently Douglas Adams' American publishers thought that some of the language in the book was too crude for Americans and asked him to take out the words 'fuck', 'asshole' and 'shit'. Adams' replaced asshole with kneebiter, shit with swut and fuck with Belgium! Sheer genius.American publishers are pussies.But you can kind of understand why when every now and again in the Feedback group someone whines that books need to be rated for language (not to mention amount of sex and violence) and there are groups devoted to letting people know if words that might upset their members are used. I remember one review where the woman said she went through the book and used a black marker on every single curse word. I hope it wasn't a library book.But still, using Belgium, that was a low blow."

3471,Message in a Bottle,Nicholas Sparks,3.95,193504,3779,Annie,5,"For those of you (like me) who have seen the movie of the same name starring Kevin Costner, the end of this novel will come as no surprise. I knew what I was getting in for when I started this book and kept the tissues well-stocked. In fact, I had to stop reading it on the bus for fear of crying in public.Instead of going into a detailed review, I'd like to share with you an excerpt of an interview Nicholas Sparks did with the NY Times after writing this novel. He shares his inspiration but I have to warn you, it is gut wrenching...""Message in a Bottle was inspired by my father after the death of my mother. In 1989, six weeks after I was married, my mother and father went horseback riding. They were avid riders and very comfortable on horses, and were simply walking the horses along a scenic trail. For a reason that no one can explain -- we assume it was the horse, a rather skittish Arabian -- my mom fell out of the saddle, off the horse, hit her head on a rock, had a cerebral hemorrhage and died. My mother and father had married at the age of twenty-one and my father was absolutely crushed by her death. They'd been married twenty-seven years and my father didn't have the slightest idea of what it meant to be a grown-up without my mom. A lot of people wear black to a funeral. My father wore black every day for four years. He pretty much became a recluse. He pulled away from his family and friends, he stopped going out, he stopped doing pretty much everything. All he did was go to work and back home again. It was heart-breaking to watch. After four long years of worrying about him, my father finally started taking baby steps out in the world again. He started reconnecting with family and friends, eventually he started to date again -- think more years passing -- eventually he met someone in particular, eventually he fell in love again. And then one day, about seven years after my mom had died, I got a call from my father. ""I'm engaged,"" he said. Now, I was happy about that, not because I didn't care about my mom -- I adored her -- but because I'd been so worried about my father. Kids worry about their parents the same way parents worry about their kids, and I was glad that he'd finally found someone.

  THE TEMPTATIONS OF HISTORY
What are some of the toughest temptations for the historian to resist?
  1. Looking for Concrete Causes2. Looking for Dramatic Turning-points3. Looking for Direct Consequences
Keegan’s history is dry and that is precisely why it is so good.Keegan tries hard to fall into these traps. He knows that he cannot afford to keep his history dry. He knows that these traps are exactly the ones which can juice it up. But luckily, he does not (or could not) juice it up.Keegan’s strength is his military analysis and command of the tactical decisions that punctuated the war the war. He tries to dress up the book beyond this by talking about ‘the mystery of why a continent at the high of its powers went to war’ & ‘the Second world war was a continuation of the First’ & ‘the race for naval supremacy perhaps started the process’ occasionally, but except for lip service at the beginning and the end of the book, these are left as mysteries.Looking for Concrete CausesKeegan does not easily take sides. He does not show one side as good and one side as bad. There is No Demonizing involved. He does not blame any one country for precipitating the war (well, at least not in his actual account - as you will see, I discount certain parts of the book).  He does not even condemn specific war practices or instances (except book burning — he does hate the Germans in those few pages. Well who wouldn’t? Book burning is just BAD), instead he shows us how desperate all sides were and how willing to push any sort of limits to escape from this war that had become a hell beyond what they could have imagined.Keegan’s war is not a grand Good vs Evil, or a Defense of Democracy/Civilization, or whatever else.It is a bunch of misguided leaders bringing destruction upon millions. At the same time, the leaders are not crucified either.In the end, Keegan maintains a very balanced approach that never tries to apportion blame for causing the war.Instead he leaves it as a Mystery #1. Good.Looking for Dramatic Turning-pointsA good story teller cannot lack for ‘turning points’ in war, as evidenced by many titles that talks of the battle that changed the war (insert Somme, Marne, etc. here).But the most common temptation is to cite the American entry as turning point. And conversely to show the U-boat mishap as the big-stupid-decision. But was it really?Without Germany’s precipitous surrender and without Austria and Ottoman’s ethnic dissolution that followed this, it might not have mattered as much. I am not denying that it did not affect the mood of the army, but Keegan’a account shows clearly that it is not just the Army’s mood that matters. The atmosphere back home matters as much.The long British blockade of trade into Germany, which forced them to resort to U-Boats again which in turn brought Americans to turn the screw even more... You see where we are going? The ‘turning point’ was a screw that was truing and tightening all along.Technology: Keegan does slip a bit at times and tries to show the influence of communication technology (esp radio) and military technology (esp tanks) but again, hedges it by showing us how contingent that too is. The British were ahead of the Germans in tank-tech, but it was purely fortuitous.  Neither were using radio tech on the ground. Again, this was not rally a technological limitation. Consider how within two years radio was everywhere, so were tanks.This teaches us an important lesson: Modern wars are not about strategy, technology or leadership anymore. It is about how long a country manages to keep its people in illusion. The longer they can, the better their shot at winning.This leads us to another trope to push: to say that ‘Democracy was the secret weapon.’ After all, if popular sentiment was so crucial and if the non-democracies were the ones who couldn’t handle a long war, that is the logical conclusion? We can take for example the Russian revolution, the German civil unrest and the Austrian ethnic strife - samples from both Allied and Central forces - what unites them? Lack of Democracy! Bingo.But we do this only by conveniently ignoring that it could easily have been France that fell prey to  civil unrest, or Italy. Or even Britain for that matter. They did all revolt at some point after all — both their armies and their peoples. So it couldn’t have been democracy alone then?The overall sense Keegan’s narrative conveys is one of a Precarious Balance of Power discovered by powers who thought war all too easy, perhaps deluded by the easy victories they were accustomed to in their colonial possessions.None of the countries involved were prepared for a long war (or even for a short one). And accordingly, hardly any army had made real progress in 4 years. The war was conducted mostly in stalemate. Where progress was made it (what little of it) was more due to one army folding up from exhaustion, moral or material.These tended to be reversed almost immediately. Any ‘turning points’ were just the winds of war, of morale - just as in The Iliad when war seems to turn at the urging of the gods giving morale to the men. What seemed decisive at the moment soon turned out to be just another exercise in stalemate. Nothing on the field seemed to decide how this stalemate could be broken. The really major shifts in fortune were usually due to events far from the battle-filed.The lack of clear turning points in the narrative means that until the last few pages, the reader can hardly believe that the war was headed towards any specific conclusion. And when it is over, there is a sense of disbelief. After all that, it was just over? Just like that?We can well believe what the world too must have felt… it must have felt incomplete.We can well understand why Hitler found it so hard to believe that it was conclusive and resorted to conspiracy theories soon.Mystery #2. Good.Looking for Direct ConsequencesThat thought, along with the details of the harsh treaty forced on the vanquished, leads us to the final thread Keegan tries to explore in his unfulfilled quest to spring one of the historiographic traps — The unity of the two wars & thus the origins of World War II.Luckily, he does it in what must now be recognized as his standard modus operandi — by setting it out in the introduction, leaving off during the actual narrative and picking it up again in the conclusion. Deft move, eh? After all, if this is his thesis, this too is not supported by the actual account of the war.Mystery #3. Great!So why did I feel the book was so great?In fact, the five stars you see above are a direct consequence of the modus operandi I described above. The five stars are for the entire book minus the introduction and the conclusion, which are the only places where Keegan tries to alleviate the dryness of his narrative with juicy historiography. Yes, the dryness gets him full marks."
1390,Earth Odyssey: Around the World in Search of Our Environmental Future,Mark Hertsgaard,4.22,254,32,Sarah,4,"Somewhat dated by the time I got around to reading it but his insights about political inaction in the face of any crisis that appears to threaten the status quo and economic bottom line seems apropos off into infinity as far as I can puzzle out. His hands on research was very interesting, his skewering of Gregg Easterbrook made me wince and laugh simultaneously kind of like Matt Taibbi does all of the time. While I think his suggestions for solutions in his conclusion build up quite a head of steam and seem grandiose I do take his point about ""doing nothing is well...going to get you nowhere so at least make the effort and adjust when necessary"". And he does offer suggestions and ideas for solutions - most people don't- they just endlessly define the problem. And the reading caused me to look up Armory Lovins (again) in Wikipedia just to see what he is up to now which pointed me to the BMW3i which further pointed me to the just released Super Bowl commercial with Katie Couric and Bryant Gumbel discussing the Internet/and the new Beemer. I laughed... My son said it was humor for the easily amused...I prefer to believe that I appreciate people that can laugh at themselves and not take themselves too seriously. Mr. Hertsgaard has written a serious book though and I appreciate that too. Give it a look ...just for the places you go in your own head.Favorite quotes: ""you can stand on a mountaintop with your mouth open for a long time before a roast duck flies into it""""Try again.

But she's being tracked as well-by a serial killer whose psychosexual madness is born out of the darkest corners of history. In quiet isolation, Tony Hill is laying to rest the scars of his past-until he's recruited back into business on a case he can't ignore. An evil is striking uncomfortably close to home, and casting a killer shadow over the life of his long-time colleague and sometimes lover.

8747,Desert Flower,Waris Dirie,4.09,13152,831,Libby,5,"There are three reasons why I chose to pursue ""Desert Flower"" by Waris Dirie. Her book showed up as a GoodReads recommendation with a summary about the author overcoming tremendous odds in Africa; I delved into the book and realized that I recognized the author to be an international super model; and, once I started reading the book, its contents were so compelling that the text was difficult to set aside for even a little bit of time.""Desert Flower"" is an autobiographical account of how Waris Dirie survived female genital mutilation (FGM) and many rape attempts, escaped the life plans her family had for her in Africa, created a completely new future for herself, and became an icon for helping other females whose lives started with a parallel path to that of her.I was in pure awe of this woman's life experiences and how she conveyed them. Several times my jaw dropped, leaving my mouth open for a while as my eyes felt like they were doubling in size due to sheer astonishment, shock, horror, lack of understanding that I felt while reading Waris' accounts. Dirie gave an account of how she developed scarred feet and how she was repeatedly questioned about them. She indicated that marks and other facets on your body equated to your history. Everyone had a story to tell...some with more significant demarcations than others. Her story incorporated the lives of many women in varying circumstances and in a number of countries; but, ultimately, it came back to their plight(s): a life of suffering physically, intellectually and emotionally. Decisions were made for them and there was a double standard that became a life-long burden. This book educated the reader about the concept of ""ritual of ignorance"" (pg. 213); one example was female genital mutilation. Many believe that FGM was a religious practice specified in the Koran and/or the Bible; but, the reality was that the behavior was demanded by its men who view women as their property. The author expressed her pride in being a product of Africa and lamented that outsiders did not understand true nature and kinship. She did not want the reader to confuse the author's humanitarian work and desire to end FGM with not being proud of her heritage; she considered it a separate mental model.Waris Dirie was offered, and accepted the position of, Special Ambassador to the United Nations Population Fund, to join the fight to stop female genital mutilation (FGM), a practice that, due to immigration, has spread vastly beyond the confines of Africa's borders. It has achieved international reach. Her goal was to strive to stop females from having to endure her early life experiences. The reader could not help but want to be a part of the author's fight. Waris Dirie's book was an outstanding read and easily earned its five-star rating."
8742,The Last Temptation,Nikos Kazantzakis,4.14,9600,600,Mohamed Al Marzooqi,5,يمكن اعتبار نيكوس كازانتزاكيس أحد أقل الكتاب حظًا في القرن العشرين، فقد ترشح في العام 1956 لنيل جائزة نوبل، ولكنه خسرها بفارق صوت واحد في التصويت لصالح ألبير كامو. وتعرضت بعض أعماله لعبث الرقابة -بل ومُنعَ نشرها- في العديد من دول العالم. إلا أن هذا الكتاب الذي نشره كازانتزاكيس في عام 1951 هو الأكثر إثارة للجدل من بين جميع كتبه (أو الأقل حظًا في معركته مع الرقابة)، إلى درجة أن البابا آنذاك عمد إلى إدراجه ضمن لائحة الكتب الممنوعة في الفاتيكان سنة 1954.ويبدو أن سوء الحظ هذا تحول إلى لعنة لاحقت كل من قرّر الإهتمام بكتاب كازنتزاكيس، ففي فرنسا قامت مجموعة من المتعصبين الكاثوليكيين بإضرام النّار في دار للسينما عام 1988، احتجاجاً على عرضها الفيلم الذي أخرجه المخرج الأمريكي مارتن سكورسيزي والمستوحى من هذه الرواية! غضب هؤلاء المتعصبون لأنهم سمعوا (ولن أقول قرأوا .. لأنني أشك أن أمثال هؤلاء يقرأون) أن كازانتزاكيس يتحدث في روايته عن المسيح كإنسان وليس كإله. وهذا ما يتعارض كلياً مع العقيدة المسيحية. وهو ما لا يستطيع أن يتحمله الأصوليون المتزمتون أما السبب الآخر الذي أغضب هؤلاء المتزمتين كان تلميح كازنتزاكيس إلى إغواء متخيّل تعرّض له المسيح وهو معلق بالمسامير على الصليب يدفعه للتخلي عن رسالته. فعقدة الرواية تبدأ فعلاً في ال40 صفحة الأخيرة منها عندما يصرخ المسيح وهو يتفطّر ألمًا على الصليب: إلهي إلهي، لماذا تركتني؟! عبارة قد توحي بأن المسيح راح يشك في حقيقة دعوته في آخر لحظة ويتمنى لو أنه لم يفعل ما فعله ويصل إلى هذه النتيجة المأسويةبالطبع فإن المتعصبين (مسيحيين كانوا أو مسلمين) لا يستطيعون القبول بمثل هذه التساؤلات المشينة التي تهدد اعتقادهم. ولذلك راحوا يلاحقون الكتاب بغية صلبه كما لاحق أسلافهم من اليهود المتعصبين -في الرواية- السيد المسيح!إن السؤال الأخلاقي الذي طرحه كازنتزاكيس في الرواية في رأيي (والذي لم يكن له علاقة بالمسيح وحده بل بكل أصحاب القضايا والمناضلين أو سمهم مائشت) يتمحور في لحظة الإغواءالأخير تلك، عندما كان المسيح قاب قوسين أو أدنى من الندم والحسرة على حياته التي أضاعها مقابل ربٍ ومريدين وأتباع تخلوا عنه، ورسالة لم يعد متأكدًا من جدواها!لست متأكدًا ما إذا كان المسيح (وأنا هنا أؤكد بأنني أتحدث عه كشخصية روائية حتى لا يهاجمني أحد المسيحيين المتعصبين ويقوم بحرق حسابي) قد اتخذ القرار الصحيح في النهاية، وما إذا كان قبوله لوضعه كان بسبب إيمانه -أخيرًا- بالرسالة التي ظنّ أنه يحملها، أم لأن الأمور كانت سيئة لدرجة أنها لا يمكن أن تسوء أكثر من ذلك (ما هو الأسوأ من الصلب والدماء تنزّ من كل مسامات جسدك أمام حشد حيواني يرشقك بالشتائم والسباب؟! أعتقد أن الموت في هذه الحالة أهون بكثير من البقاء في هذه الوضع المزري)بالطبع لن يفهم المتعصبون هذا الكلام، ولن يدركوا بأن الصوة الإنسانية للمسيح في هذه الرواية تجعله أكثر عظمة من الصورة الأسطورية أو التبجيلية التي رسختها أجيال المؤمنين المتلاحقة على مرّ الصور. وهذا الأمر ينسحب على المسلمين كذلك فلا زلت أذكر التأثر الذي أصابني (وأنا طالب في الإعدادية) عندما قرأت للمرة الأولى عبقريات العقّاد (عبقرية محمّد وأبوبكر وعمر) التي قدمني فيها العقّاد للإنساني في هذه الشخصيات بعد أن حولها منهج التربية الإسلامية في لاوعيي لنماذج صارمة بعيدة عن إنسانيتها وصلتها الوثيقة بالحياة.
2012,"Whipping Star (ConSentiency Universe, #1)",Frank Herbert,3.65,2694,145,Lyn,3,"Original.Whipping Star by Frank Herbert, first published in 1970, explores among many things the complexities of communication; heightened by hyperbole as between xenological species but also as an allegory for human relations. I once cross-examined a troglodyte who was being intentionally evasive and it was maddening. Reading passages in this book was akin to that experience, yet Herbert uses it as an illustration of the frailty of relational semantics. Another aspect of this book that was disconcerting was an undertone of absurdist humor. From reading other Herbert creations, I cannot believe that this was intentional, yet there it was, kind of a Monty Python sensibility. And all the more amazingly, Herbert pulls it off as a psychological instrument. This would have made a bizarre Doctor Who episode, or a CSI show written and produced by Terry Gilliam. Fascinating, oddly hypnotic, weird and completely unique (except for the pseudo-sequel The Dosadi Experiment) Whipping Star is a short, strange trip.Finally, Whipping Star represents a singularly jaw-dropping phenomenon, one that was not achieved by Heinlein’s Starman Jones or by Ursula K. LeGuin’s The Dispossessed. After decades of reading science fiction, I wish that I had paid more attention in math class."
401,Don DeLillo's White Noise (Bloom's Modern Critical Interpretations),Harold Bloom,3.65,23,1,  LunaBel ,3,"My rating:2.5 At last! I have mixed feelings about this books.Some of the essays were good; others were just plain boring and repetitive.All in all, there was some useful information that make it worthwhile to read the critical books.Since the essays are collected and brought here as separate entities, there was a lot of repetive which was redundent and annoying. It seems that there are a set of themes that keep being mentioned over and over again until...These themes are:Death: how Jak and Babette want to cease fearing death, and how they carry on their plans to stop being scared of death. Consumer-space: products that you find at the supermarket can save you from death. Tv: tv can give you the satisfaction of seeing the sublime, that is catastrophes, while you're safe in your couch with your family and beer in hand. Simulacra: we are living in a copied imageWords: they have power but they have become meaningless."
403,Americana,Don DeLillo,3.44,3907,296,Violet wells,3,"I’ve now completed the set, read all DeLillo’s books. This is his first novel and though impressive as a first novel doesn’t really have much to recommend it in my eyes. It’s narrated by an obnoxious filmmaker who heads West to find his creative soul, sort of like a literary road movie. We get lots of snapshots of American life; we also get quite a lot of overwriting and a fair smattering of pretentiousness. A fascinating feature of his books is that they often begin on a more inspired plane than they end. DeLillo loves writing; but he loves writing sentences rather than stories. He’s like Nabokov in the delight he takes in crafting individual sentences. I don’t think any living writer is better at individual sentence writing. I can think of at least four of his novels that begin with stunningly beautiful prose but eventually peter out as if he runs out of that magic elixir, inspiration. At the point where he tries to forge into shape what he’s previously written. DeLillo doesn’t do plots. You could say plot is the discipline at the heart of any novel. It’s probably frustrating at times, like the rules of any game. And it seems to curb DeLillo’s flow. The alternative to plotting a novel is to theme it. Which is what he does but has a tendency to become a bit too esoteric and ambitious, to lose focus. Zero K was probably better unified in terms of theme than some of his earlier novels but the inspired writing was missing. The Names has the inspired writing but the theme becomes ever more oblique and elusive. To be honest I can’t think of much to say about Americana except if you fancy reading him make sure you avoid this one. It was a bit like listening to an early demo recorded in a garage by a band you love."
3478,Message in a Bottle,Nicholas Sparks,3.95,193497,3778,Annie,5,"For those of you (like me) who have seen the movie of the same name starring Kevin Costner, the end of this novel will come as no surprise. I knew what I was getting in for when I started this book and kept the tissues well-stocked. In fact, I had to stop reading it on the bus for fear of crying in public.Instead of going into a detailed review, I'd like to share with you an excerpt of an interview Nicholas Sparks did with the NY Times after writing this novel. He shares his inspiration but I have to warn you, it is gut wrenching...""Message in a Bottle was inspired by my father after the death of my mother. In 1989, six weeks after I was married, my mother and father went horseback riding. They were avid riders and very comfortable on horses, and were simply walking the horses along a scenic trail. For a reason that no one can explain -- we assume it was the horse, a rather skittish Arabian -- my mom fell out of the saddle, off the horse, hit her head on a rock, had a cerebral hemorrhage and died. My mother and father had married at the age of twenty-one and my father was absolutely crushed by her death. They'd been married twenty-seven years and my father didn't have the slightest idea of what it meant to be a grown-up without my mom. A lot of people wear black to a funeral. My father wore black every day for four years. He pretty much became a recluse. He pulled away from his family and friends, he stopped going out, he stopped doing pretty much everything. All he did was go to work and back home again. It was heart-breaking to watch. After four long years of worrying about him, my father finally started taking baby steps out in the world again. He started reconnecting with family and friends, eventually he started to date again -- think more years passing -- eventually he met someone in particular, eventually he fell in love again. And then one day, about seven years after my mom had died, I got a call from my father. ""I'm engaged,"" he said. Now, I was happy about that, not because I didn't care about my mom -- I adored her -- but because I'd been so worried about my father. Kids worry about their parents the same way parents worry about their kids, and I was glad that he'd finally found someone. Two days after that phone call, my father was driving home late one night, fell asleep at the wheel of his car, crashed, and died . . .""Is it better to have loved and lost then never loved at all? Nicholas Sparks says yes and after reading Message in a Bottle, I'm inclined to agree. PS It's 100% just as good as the movie. Promise."
402,Mao II,Don DeLillo,3.68,8100,451,Jr Bacdayan,4,"“The cult of Mao was the cult of the book.”A writer is always said to bring wisdom and knowledge to his readers, to give them guidance, clarity of mind by using stories and instances regardless of truth as exemplars. But can the writer do the opposite and inspire terror, chaos, and bewilderment? It is often said that a writer sacrifices himself for the better fortune of his readers. Writing should be a beloved practice to those who are enamored by words, by language, and sometimes by the ability of playing god and make-believe. That is not always the case. It is easily traceable in literary history that writers have the hardest time concentrating on their works. Indeed it is rather easy to write a few pages when inspiration hits you, but writing and rewriting hundreds even thousands of pages over a grueling stretch isn’t an attractive plight. Writers readily suffer fatigue, languor, creative blocks, and would often put off their work for great lengths of time. But then his suffering is assuaged the minute he publishes his work and people are inspired by what he painfully poured out of himself. But what if instead of inspiration, his horrors take hold of his prose and flow through his readers? What if he instills fear and uneasiness into their minds? And what if the book takes the form of a chimera that terrorizes both creator and receptor? In Christopher Nolan’s Inception he uses dreams to put in ideas into people’s heads. But in Don DeLillo’s Mao II, the obvious truth is revealed, in the real world, writing books take this function. “What terrorists gain, novelists lose. The degree to which they influence mass consciousness is the extent of our decline as shapers of sensibility and thought. That danger they represent equals our own failure to be dangerous.” In Mao II, Bill Gray, the world’s most renowned novelist, an aging dinosaur and an illusive sonofabitch firmly believes that he was born too late. He was of the idea that writers used to be the scale of the world’s moral balance and sometimes even the force the drives it off its axis. Books inspired fear, they served as catalysts of change. Most of the visionary books were banned; great writers were often murdered and burned on a stake. People in power didn’t like ideas people were getting from what they read. The Bible inspired great religious frenzy and turned lots of heathens into believers of Jesus Christ. Similar function goes for Islam’s Quran. And these works inspired a great many religious wars. The Greek Philosophers such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle’s works inspired an intellectual revolution. The Malleus Maleficarum caused the deaths of thousands of forward thinking women. Mein Kampf was an idea that killed millions of Jews. Marx and Engle’s Manifesto started a movement so hated by the world. Oscar Wilde’s flair caused uproar and probably got him killed. D.H. Lawrence’s vulgarity made him a literary villain. Victor Hugo’s Les Miserables gave the common people the feeling of power. Jose Rizal’s novels inspired the Philippine revolution. Even Nabokov’s Lolita gave rise to such a resounding cry of moral righteousness. But nowadays, definitely post 9-11, terrorists and acts of terror have taken hold over the populace and what was once a mass that was affected by literary ideas now moved to terror’s rhythm of fear and self preservation. The Osama bin Ladens and the Saddam Husseins of the world are now more known than the Garcia-Marquez and the Toni Morrisons. Even modern writers have not escaped the fate of fear. Salman Rusdie’s Satanic Verses shows how terrorism is encroached even to the influencers emeritus. A long time ago people read books and these chiefly inspired how they think, the choices they made. Nowadays people watch and listen to terror-dominated news and their mindset and life-choices are affected by what has happened. Books are now relegated as fantasy and escapism serving as a pastime rather than a critical tool of change, and it is no great wonder the biggest selling books are about vampires and masochistic sex. What was once a public that read and reacted on ideas and concepts now dwelled on reported events. The time of the thinking man is gone; the rule of the fear-addled reactionary homo-sapien is upon us. Is this the post-modern word we live in? “He is saying terror is the what we use to give our people their place in the world. What used to be achieved through great work, we gain through terror. Terror makes the new future possible. All men, one man. Men live in history as never before. He is saying we make and change the history minute by minute. History is not the book or the human memory. We do history in the morning and change it after lunch.”“Mao believed in the process of thought reform. It is possible to make by changing the basic nature of the people.”Mao Zedong, the man who graces the novel’s title was not just a revolutionary leader; he was also a brilliant writer. As a youth he wrote well-regarded poems and several philosophical treatises on the subject of war, democracy and so forth. But what really symbolized Mao, aside from his images, was his Little Red Book that the Chinese people clamored for. Formally called Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung, this work was printed and sold by the millions because the populace wanted to learn and adapt the ideas of their leader. I am saying this because although Mao did commit many vile acts of terrorism, what propelled people to notice and revere him was not his actions but the idea he wanted to propagate. “There is a longing for Mao that will sweep the world… eloquent macho bullshit.”This novel of set pieces isn’t as coherent as I’d hoped it to be. It combines hazy, fragmented views on terror, on war, of the lone and of the mass, of writing and shaping and out of the disarray comes a piercing cry out of the rubble that should be heard in the shell-shocked world of today: fear me, fear the writer. DeLillo purposely fills the book with scenes that cause unease and he reminds the reader that an idea is still scarier than an act. That the mass can never be compelled by fear and terror unless it takes root in informed viewpoints that the individual must make on his own, and that when traced, everything comes back to literature. Thus when man realizes his errs, he shall see that terror does not come from explosions and bombs, but from letters and words."
405,Ratner's Star,Don DeLillo,3.5,1548,132,Michael Finocchiaro,1,"What a bunch of meaningless gibberish. And all this so Billy can eat worms (literally not figuratively) in the end? I guess DeLillo was attempting to pull a Pynchon here but seems to fail miserably. I could wade through 100s of pages of Proustian interior dialog and description, 100s of pages of how-to-run-a-dysfunctional-tennis-academy-or-drug-rehab-center in Wallace or 100s of pages of Pynchonian voyages across anarchic, dystopian spaces in Germany or Mexico but this drivel about math and logic with spectacularly uninteresting, overly described and curiously underdeveloped characters (particularly the completely devoid of emotion with a more 8 year old sexuality or lack thereof than a 14 year old) was boring and inane. I felt I wasted two good days of reading time rather than the feeble attempt to confuse and impress with pseudo-science and pseudo-math in the first part (and here Pynchon is far superior in Mason&Dixon, Gravity's Rainbow, and Against the Day with far more intriguing apartés about math and science) and the (poor imitation of) Rothian sexual abandon in the second half. What was DeLillo really trying to accomplish with this book?Well, that's it, after impressing me with Underworld, Libra, Mao II and White Noise, he has completely turned me off with Players, Falling Man, Zero K (Christ that was bad) and now Ratner's Star, I am done and scratching him definitively off my Nobel- or Pulitzer-deserving list over to the has-been or wanna-be category reserved for 4th places or ""I don't wanna be a one termer!"" (anyone else remember that Bush I SNL segment?) column. If you really love reading good challenging and enlightening literature, don't look for it in Ratner's Star."
8497,The Second Sex,Simone de Beauvoir,4.1,21469,852,Aubrey,5," The fact that we are human beings is infinitely more important than all the peculiarities that distinguish human beings from one another; it is never the given that confers superiorities: ‘virtue’, as the ancients called it, is defined on the level of ‘that which depends on us’.My life has led me to develop a love for thought, a love heavily dependent on the context of reality and my personal view of such, a love that has been, is, and will continue to grow through heavy doses of words both spoken and printed. I will admit to being biased towards the printed, as well as to being biased in many things as a result of characteristics both physical and mental; the fault of nature and nurture, neither one of which I can help very much. My method of coping with having a love for thinking, while being aware of the inherent inaccuracies of said thinking, is a rabid interest in argument, debate if you will, on many fronts that concern me.Being a woman concerns me. With that, let us begin.I am a white middle class female undergraduate who has spent all twenty-two years of her life in the United States. I did not read this book for a class. I do not in any way claim that this book speaks on all women’s issues, or deem women’s issues more important than those of any other oppressed group, whether via race, sexuality, financial security, et al. I simply don’t have the firsthand experience with other issues that, I believe, would accredit me to speak on them to such length. Account for the inherent biases as you see fit.Females are biologically different from males in the interest of propagation of the species, resulting in imposed monthly cycles that involve a whole host of painful and bloody side effects, as well as the inconvenient and sometimes dangerous states of pregnancy and giving birth. Females also have a more difficult time of building up muscle mass and other aspects lending to physical movement, due to the consequences of puberty and resulting chemical development.
  The bearing of maternity upon the individual life, regulated naturally in animals by the oestrus cycle and the seasons, is not definitely prescribed in woman - society alone is the arbiter. The bondage of woman to the species is more or less rigorous according to the number of births demanded by society and the degree of hygienic care provided for pregnancy and childbirth. Thus, while it is true that in the higher animals the individual existence is asserted more imperiously by the male than by the female, in the human species individual 'possibilities' depend upon the economic and social situation.We are now acquainted with the dramatic conflict that harrows the adolescent girl at puberty: she cannot become 'grown-up' without accepting her femininity; and she knows already that her sex condemns her to a mutilated and fixed existence, which she faces at this time under the form of an impure sickness and a vague sense of guilt. Her inferiority was sensed at first merely as a deprivation; but the lack of a penis has now become defilement and transgression. So she goes onward towards the future, wounded, shameful, culpable.
In the United States, the Nineteenth Amendment to the US Constitution was ratified on August 18, 1920, which declares that: The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex. This occurred 144 years after the US declared independence, 137 years after the US was recognized as independent, and 132 years after the Constitution itself was ratified.
  In masculine hands logic is often a form of violence, a sly kind of tyranny: the husband, if older and better educated than his wife, assumes on the basis of this superiority to give no weight at all to her opinions when he does not share them; he tirelessly proves to her that he is right. For her part, she becomes obstinate and refuses to see anything in her husband's arguments; he simply sticks to his own notions. And so a deep misunderstanding comes between them. He makes no effort to comprehend the feelings and reactions she is not clever enough to justify, though they are deeply rooted in her; she does not grasp what is vital behind the pedantic logic with which her husband overwhelms her. 
On June 20, 2013, many news organizations issued articles discussing a report released by the World Health Organization titled Global and regional estimates of violence against women: Prevalence and health effects of intimate partner violence and non-partner sexual violence. The results? One in three women has faced intimate partner violence or sexual violence. 40% of women killed worldwide were slain by the partner.
  And therein lies the wondrous hope that man has often put in woman: he hopes to fulfill himself as a being by carnally possessing a being, but at the same time confirming his sense of freedom through the docility of a free person. No man would consent to be a woman, but every man wants women to exist.Man has no need of the unconditional devotion he claims, nor of the idolatrous love that flatters his vanity; he accepts them only on condition that he need not satisfy the reciprocal demands these attitudes imply. He preaches to woman that she should give—and her gifts bore him to distraction; she is left in embarrassment with her useless offerings, her empty life. On the day when it will be possible for woman to love not in her weakness but in her strength, not to escape herself but to find herself, not to abase herself but to assert herself—on that day love will become for her, as for man, a source of life and not of mortal danger. In the meantime, love represents in its most touching form the curse that lies heavily upon woman confined in the feminine universe, woman mutilated, insufficient unto herself. The innumerable martyrs to love bear witness against the injustice of a fate that offers a sterile hell as ultimate salvation.
There is currently in the US a widespread political machination in many states aiming towards the eradication of legalized abortion, in essence granting living women less rights to their bodies than dead individuals who in life chose not to donate their bodies to science.
  ...modern woman is everywhere permitted to regard her body as capital for exploitation. The fact is that a true human privilege is based upon the anatomical privilege only in virtue of the total situation.That the child is the supreme aim of woman is a statement having precisely the value of an advertising slogan....the distortion begins when the religion of Maternity proclaims that all mothers are saintly. For while maternal devotion may be perfectly genuine, this, in fact, is rarely the case. Maternity is usually a strange mixture of narcissism, altruism, idle day-dreaming, sincerity, bad faith, devotion and cynicism. 
Also current in the US is the discussion of rape culture and slut shaming in light of the events of the Steubenville High School Rape Case, where media outlets offered biased coverage that sympathized with the rapists and rarely focused on the victim.
   As a matter of fact, the privileged position of man comes from the integration of his biologically aggressive role with his social function as leader or master; it is on account of this social function that the physiological differences take on all their significance. Because man is ruler in the world, he holds that the violence of his desires is a sign of his sovereignty; a man of great erotic capacity is said to be strong, potent - epithets that imply activity and transcendence. But, on the other hand, woman being only an object, she will be described as warm or frigid, which is to say that she will never manifest other than passive qualities.It is a mistake to seek in fantasies the key to concrete behaviour; for fantasies are created and cherished as fantasies. The little girl who dreams of violation with mingled horror and acquiescence does not really wish to be violated and if such a thing should happen it would be a hateful calamity. Masculine desire is as much an offence as it is a compliment; in so far as she feels herself responsible for her charm, or feels she is exerting it of her own accord, she is much pleased with her conquests, but to the extent that her face, her figure, her flesh are facts she must bear with, she wants to hide them from this independent stranger who lusts after them.Man encourages these allurements by demanding to be lured: afterwards he is annoyed and reproachful. But he feels only indifference and hostility for the artless, guileless young girl...she is obliged to offer man the myth of her submission, because he insists on domination, and her compliance would only be perverted from the start.
In the US, prostitution, the ‘business or practice of providing sexual services to another person in return for payment’, is illegal. 
  The Cinderella myth flourishes especially in prosperous countries like America. How should the men there spend their surplus money if not upon a woman? Orson Welles, among others, has embodied in 'Citizen Kane' that imperial and false generosity: it is to glorify his own power that Kane chooses to shower his gifts upon an obscure singer and to impose her upon the public as a great queen of song. When the hero of another film, 'The Razor's Edge', returns from India equipped with absolute wisdom, the only thing he finds to do with it is to redeem a prostitute. One remarkable fact among others is that the married woman had her place in society but enjoyed no rights therein; whereas the unmarried female, honest woman or prostitute, had all the legal capacities of a man, but up to this century was more or less excluded from social life.Sewers are necessary to guarantee the wholesomeness of palaces, according to the Fathers of the Church. And it has often been remarked that the necessity exists of sacrificing one part of the female sex in order to save the other and prevent worse troubles. One of the arguments in support of slavery, advanced by the American supporters of the institution, was that the Southern whites, being all freed from servile duties, could maintain the most democratic and refined relations among themselves; in the same way, a caste of 'shameless women' allows the 'honest woman' to be treated with the most chivalrous respect. The prostitute is a scapegoat; man vents his turpitude upon her, and he rejects her. Whether she is put legally under police supervision or works illegally in secret, she is in any case treated as a pariah.
The Equal Pay Act was signed into law in the US in 1963. The male-female income difference in the US was in 2010 at a female-to-male earnings ratio of 0.81, medium income in full-time year-round workers being $42,800 for men compared to $34,700 for women.
  When he is in a co-operative and benevolent relation with woman, his theme is the principle of abstract equality, and he does not base his attitude upon such inequality as may exist. But when he is in conflict with her, the situation is reversed: his theme will be the existing inequality, and he will even take it as justification for denying abstract equality.Woman is shut up in a kitchen or in a boudoir, and astonishment is expressed that her horizon is limited. Her wings are clipped, and it is found deplorable that she cannot fly. Let but the future be opened to her, and she will no longer be compelled to linger in the present.
The history of literature is dominated by male writers. Since 1901 when the first annual Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded, out of the 109 individuals that have received it, twelve were female. More women have been awarded the Nobel in this field than any other, save for the Nobel Peace Prize, of which fifteen of the 101 recipients were female.
  When he describes woman, each writer discloses his general ethics and the special idea he has of himself; and in her he often betrays also the gap between his world view and his egotistical dreams. …the categories in which men think of the world are established from their point of view, as absolute: they misconceive reciprocity, here as everywhere. A mystery for man, woman is considered to be mysterious in essence.And while her lover fondly believes he is pursuing the Ideal, he is actually the plaything of nature, who employs all this mystification for the ends of reproduction.'Pendants have for two thousand years reiterated the notion that women have a more lively spirit, men more solidity; that women have more delicacy in their ideas and men greater power of attention. A Paris idler who once took a walk in the Versailles Gardens concluded that, judging from all he saw, the trees grow ready trimmed.'–Stendhal
Feminism is, well. You tell me. I have to say, though, bra-burning and unshaven legs seem empty condemnations in comparison to rape and domestic abuse.
  The truth is that just as—biologically—males and females are never victims of one another but both victims of the species, so man and wife together undergo the oppression of an institution they did not create. If it is asserted that men oppress women, the husband is indignant; he feels that he is the one who is oppressed—and he is; but the fact is that it is the masculine code, it is the society developed by the males and in their interest, that has established woman’s situation in a form that is at present a source of torment for both sexes.It is perfectly natural for the future woman to feel indignant at the limitations posed upon her by her sex. The real question is not why she should reject them: the problem is rather to understand why she accepts them.
I thought about keeping a list of how many authors/philosophers/lauded historical people I’d have to completely boycott due to misogyny. That action makes as much sense as completely boycotting those who favor feminism. Think about it.Alternative Title:

404,Running Dog,Don DeLillo,3.42,1385,91,Greg,4,"Looking down at Krok's comment (comment number 1 and the only comment as I write these words), I have to agree. Maybe not with the ultimate ranking of DeLillo novels, but this is a remarkably under-appreciated work. I doubt anyone has been paying attention, but I've been on a very slow and only periodically remembered task to read all of the DeLillo novels leading up to Underworld with the rough theory that Infinite Jest is a response or homage or a something to the pre-Underworld DeLillo. I meant to read them in order, but I realized I don't own Players yet, and the most recent troll on Karen's review of Underworld, made me want to dive back in to my mini-mission and I guess it's ok to skip a book, as long as I go back to it before I read Underworld. DFW updates from this book? Some similar themes, but nothing really new. The film that everyone is after feels like The Entertainment in the way people are reacting. Besides some characters feeling sort of similar to ones that DFW populates Infinite Jest with there wasn't anything as overt here as in Great Jones Street or End Zone (you can find my reviews for these in my shelves, I'm too lazy to link to them even though this is probably costing me a few votes). I've been a lazy and distracted reader lately so I might have missed things. The book? It's quite good. After Ratner's Star, which made me want to stab my eyes out with a rusty screwdriver rather than continue reading the book, this was great. I have some complaints, it feels a little underdeveloped. I think it's good as it is, but I feel like he could have done more with the characters, he has so many really good characters here but they are given a really limited amount of space to live in. This should have been his first BIG book, he had the story and the characters were more than just a series of quirky shadows spouting stylized dialogue like too many of the ones that populated RS. Maybe that is IJ's debt to this book, DFW gave the story line of the 'film' room to develop, I'm sort of grasping for straws here and I just thought of that, so I'm not sure if I stand behind it. Ignoring RS and not having read Players, I'm still going to say that DeLillo's early / 1970's work is great. Jimmy Cline, etc. made a comment on Karen's above mentioned review (he's not the troll), he said, ""I'm just conjecturing here, but it seems that his work does not age well at all, and that when his pomo navel-gazing gets at all over the top, the critics just pounce on him like rabid dogs. This is about Underworld, so I can't weigh in on that book, but I would say that DeLillo's early work is going to age quite well, he plays with some post-modern tricks in these early books, but he is more interested, it seems, in creating his own overly stylized version of America and the author, DeLillo, never appears to be making any appearances. Compared to the work of say John Barth, which mostly has aged as well as some hideous Park Avenue woman with too many face lifts and botox injections, there is still a freshness to the early (non RS(why is this one DeLillo's favorite early novel? Why?!?!) work. These early novels are quite good, maybe not developed as fully as they could be, maybe they could be longer and the themes delved into a bit deeper, the characters given some more room to stretch their legs and all of that, but they are still (in my not-so-humble opinion) some of the highlights of that dreary decade known as the 70's when authors appeared in book jackets wearing awful turtlenecks and people had key-parties and swinger orgies in between group readings of Jonathan Livingston Seagull. Now on to the 1980's with DeLillo.Moll was suspicious of quests. At the bottom of most long and obsessive searches, in her view, was some vital deficiency on the part of the individual in pursuit, a meagerness of spirit.She sat in the dark, listening to Odell fiddle with the projector.Even more depressing than the nature of a given quest was the likely result. Whether people searched for an object of some kind, or inner occasion, or answer, or state of being, it was almost always disappointing. Nothing but themselves. Of course there were those who believed the search itself was all that mattered. The search itself is the reward."
1283,Investing in REITs: Real Estate Investment Trusts,Ralph L. Block,3.58,98,10,Leo Polovets,4,"I read this in an effort to broaden and improve my investing skills. REITs, or Real Estate Investment Trusts, are like mutual funds of real-estate assets (typically this means either managed properties or mortgage notes), and Investing in REITs explains just about everything one might want to know about the subject. This includes a formal definition of REITs, coverage of the different types of REITs, and how to decide whether a particular REIT is a good investment and what its fair value should be. It’s hard to say anything bad about the quality of the content, but I did discover that I didn’t really need to read an entire book about REITs to understand their pros and cons; a short blog post or 5-page article would have served me just as well."
1281,"Men are From Mars, Women are From Venus Low Price CD",John Gray,3.52,131140,4294,Rachel,1,"My biggest problem with the book is that it is extremely sexist. The book continually explains that this is just how men are, and then goes on to explain how women can learn to deal with that. Biggest load of crap ever. While some people will certainly fall into these stereotypes, I believe this book may cause more harm than good. Some of the sexist highlights:-a woman should go shopping when her man decides that he needs alone time (this is how she can show him her love and trust) {apparently women were able to spend more time shopping when they lived on Venus, because the planet was “covered in shopping malls.”)-a man can leave anytime he wants – in fact, he cannot even control when it is that he may need to leave-a woman is unfairly punishing a man if he leaves even when she really needs him and she then acts upset or hurt in the slightest upon his return Gray thinks that only women are needy, and that only men need to be alone. Not so. Apparently, Gray thinks that women only ever want to be with their men, and nothing more. Well, that is simply not true for most independent, capable, and informed women. But that is beside the point. Let’s assume that it is true. What bothers me even more is that Gray identifies the different needs of men and women (men need space; women need someone to listen to them/emotional attachment), but he then goes on to explain that when both men and women are experiencing their needs at the same time, the woman simply must concede to the man’s needs. Gray explains that *whenever* men need to be alone, that is just the way it is. There are no compromises. In his book, a woman, Cathy, asks the question: “If he gets to be in his cave then what about me? I give him space, but what do I get?” And here is the answer: “What Cathy gets is the best her partner can give at the time. By not demanding that he listen to her when she wants to talk, she can avoid making the problem much worse by having a huge argument. Second, she gets his support when he comes back – when he is truly capable of supporting here.” That is simply ridiculous. What a woman gets is *whatever* her partner can give at the time. A woman just must let the man have what it is he needs, regardless of her needs at the time. I’m sorry, but being in a relationship requires selflessness, and that means that both men and women have to give more than what our selfish natures think we can handle. While I’ll admit that some of Gray’s advice is helpful (insofar as the individuals in a given relationship fall into Gray’s stereotypes), they simply are just not that profound. Essentially, “if you listen to women and try not to take them for granted, your relationship will be better.” Well, no kidding. The book just seemed full of perplexing thoughts. For example: “Men rarely say ‘I’m sorry’ because on Mars it means you have done something wrong and you are apologizing.” Well, even on earth, I was under the impression that when you are apologizing, you say sorry. I don’t know why the definition of sorry would somehow explain why men would be less able than women to say it. In the chapter about how to score points with the opposite sex, there is a list of 101 things a man can do such as bringing her flowers, listening to her, complimenting her, calling her, etc. Most of them are good, even if obvious suggestions; nonetheless, Gray’s view of women as subordinate still creeps in. My favorite thing a man can do to score points with a woman is #67: “read out loud or cut out sections of the newspaper that would interest her.” Good idea. Because I can’t read, and even if I could, women don’t read newspapers. Come on! Even more upsetting is that the corresponding list of 26 things that a woman can do to “score big with men” involves NOT doing things. For example, he makes mistakes, and she doesn’t say anything; “he disappoints her, and she does not punish him.” There are only a few things that a woman can affirmatively do to score points, one of which is “she really enjoys having sex with him.” Again, women are largely the passive actors. I’ve wasted far too much energy and time already on this book. It is now dead to me. "

4471927,Divide And Rule,L. Sprague de Camp,3.31,32,3,Nick,4,"This slim volume, which also contains the story The Stolen Dormouse, is an enjoyable romp of through a pair of weird dystopian futures. In the title story, the reason for the dystopia is that we have alien overlords [okay, so the cover artist drew them like giant rabbits, but they're still alien overlords] who have limited our weapons, technology, education and political systems, to make us easier to rule. While the McGuffin used to fight back is a little contrived, the character interactions and dialogue are what makes the story fun.In The Stolen Dormouse, it's a dystopia of our own making, in which de Camp was remarkably prescient. Corporations rule everything and try to destroy unions and professional organizations, the U.S. lost a war to a Communist nation in the late 1960s, and there's a subway under Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles with a station at Western Avenue. Hmmm...the Red Line, the Vietnam War [off by a couple of years, but he did write the story in the early 1940s] and modern U.S economics taken to a slightly silly extreme.The attitudes of the characters in both stories are dated, but much less so than a lot of other stories from the same era. The female characters are not just backdrops or love interests, but have at least some personalities and strong traits.So, while the stories are a bit old-fashioned, they're still very interesting and worth reading."
4844,What the Dormouse Said: How the Sixties Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry,John Markoff,3.84,749,85,Natali,4,"First the good: A very inspirational read for anyone who loves computers and history. Markoff tells the the underground tale of how personal computers evolved out of a (sometimes illicit) counterculture in the 1960s in the San Francisco Bay Area. The story made me homesick for the independent, creative, and brilliant spirit that permeates the Bay Area. I am proud to be from there. Now a few drawbacks: The book is a little hard to follow because there were so many players. I really wanted to know the personal background of every major contributor to the personal computing movement but I had a hard time keeping them all straight. Perhaps a little different organization might have been helpful. Also, the book omits the contributions of women and minorities. I know that these groups' contribution were limited but some of the wives of the major contributors hardly had their due. One woman in particular was only ever referred to as so-and-so's wife. It is no wonder that the computer is such a masculine tool. It was designed by white men who could afford the time to play with their toys. Anyone who calls the computer androgynous is seriously mistaken. This book does provide a fascinating juxtaposition for the state of personal computing versus the intention of personal computing. Our digital founding fathers intended information and software to be freely exchanged. They figured they would make their money on hardware, not software. It is amazing how, after the 90s era of big money Microsoft, we come full circle to a computer culture that values free-flowing information. But this is still tricky. Here is a great quote from the book illustrating this: ""Stewart Brand expressed the fundamental tension most clearly: 'Information wants to be free,' he said, 'and information also wants to be very expensive.'"" "
4840,Death of a Dormouse,Patrick Ruell,3.67,201,18,Eric_W,3,"I'm waffling on the rating for this book. I am a devoted Reginald Hill fan, especially of the Dalziel and Pascoe series; even more particularly when read by Brian Glover. A number of Hill's earlier works are being re-released both in paper and audio and this is one of those. It's clearly not up to the standard he set for himself later; then again, it's a very different genre. This is a quasi spy/thriller. The heroine's husband dies in a car crash and she then learns that all is not what it seems. Fairly traditional plotting. She manages to investigate and get herself out of some bad situations. Again pretty ordinary. Occasionally, though, you can see signs of the Hill to come, and that's why 3 rather than 2 stars."

Montgomery,4.23,540420,14380,Shannon,5,"I don't often give books five stars and as I neared the end of this book, I gave some thought to how many stars this book deserved. I've read the Anne of Green Gables series once before - over twenty years ago. In spite of the amount of time that has elapsed, I clearly recall reading the last book in the series very slowly and thinking to myself, ""I will be so sad to not be able to read about Anne anymore."" When I picked up this book a few days ago to re-read it, I found within a few chapters that it was like seeing an old friend. Anne was even more delightful than I recalled, since I now have daughters who share her ""scope for imagination,"" her penchant for large words and her zest for life. Reading about Anne's appreciation for life's loveliness made me appreciate my daughters and long to live more in-the-moment myself. So, I decided that a book that feels like an old friend after twenty years deserves five stars.Anne Shirley must be one of the most delightful characters ever written, largely because she is far from perfect. She makes mistakes, as we all do, but her mistakes are much funnier than my own feel and she makes me see the value in learning from each of them, laughing at them and moving on. Like my middle daughter, there is no lukewarm with Anne. I love that she approaches life enthusiastically, despite have spent a decade belonging to no one.I also like that Anne talks straightforwardly about wanting, seeking and building friendships. Even now, I am hesitant, awkward and scattershot at building relationships. I may meet someone who seems a kindred spirit, but lack the time or, let's be honest, sheer boldness to approach them and seek to build a friendship. We see Anne seek and build relationships not only upon her arrival in Avonlea, but during her time at Queens.One reasons I re-read this book was because two friends recommended it for it's fluency in writing dialogue. Unlike Little Women, which I attempted to read for the writing, this book did not disappoint. The dialogue sounds exactly like each character would sound and it flows smoothly from narration to dialogue and back. In fact, I'm baffled that Little Women routinely makes top 100 lists while Anne of Green Gables is nowhere to be found on the lists of must-read classics. Unlike the Little Women characters who are archetypes rather than three dimensional characters, Anne is a bold a female character who refuses to be categorized. That's exactly why I love her and love this book."

8137,"The Road to Yesterday (Anne of Green Gables, #9)",L.M. Montgomery,3.78,3588,231,Manybooks,5,"I very much enjoyed The Blythes are Quoted, although the interspersing of short stories, poetry and Blythe family interludes does make and call for slow and deliberate reading (and while the poems are lovely, descriptive, often thought provoking, if you really do NOT enjoy poetry, you might want to consider skimming or even skipping the poetry sections, as doing so does not interfere all that much with the short stories and novellas presented). Although most of the featured stories have previously appeared in The Road to Yesterday, and the first story (Some Fools and a Saint) in Among the Shadows: Tales from the Darker Side, the stories are for the most part abridged in these books (and often quite significantly shortened at that); in The Blythes are Quoted they are shown as they appear in the manuscript that was presented to L. M. Montgomery's publisher on the very day of her death (which now appears to have been due to a drug overdose which might very likely have been deliberate). This is a must-read for L.M. Montgomery fans (but regrettably, the book does not seem to be all that readily available in the United States or Europe). For dedicated L.M. Montgomery fans, I would also strongly recommend perusing both Elizabeth Rollins Epperly's foreword and Benjamin Lefebvre's afterword (but only AFTER having completed the book, so as to avoid possible spoilers)."

5027,I Love Saturdays y domingos,Alma Flor Ada,4,485,168,Manybooks,4,"Both the text (the narrative) and the colourfully fun illustrations are evocative and engaging, a heartwarming presentation and depiction of a loving inter- and multiethnic extended family. The voice of the young narrator (a little girl who spends Saturdays with her European-American paternal grandparents and Sundays, los domingos, with her Mexican-American maternal grandparents) shines brightly and demonstrates the child's love and affection for both sets of grandparents, and the love the entire extended family has for one another. Although the grandparents do have some different cultural traditions, it is clearly demonstrated that while cultural differences do exist, they are often only skin-deep; both sets of grandparents also have a great deal in common. This would be a wonderful book to share with children whose families are multiethnic, or with children who are interested in knowing more about their own families' ethnic backgrounds. I could also imagine using the book in a pre-school or grade one to three classroom setting, perhaps for a social studies or immigration unit. The little girl's descriptions of her Sundays (her domingos) with her Mexican-American maternal grandparents contain quite a number of Spanish words and expressions. Personally, I love this aspect of the book, as I think it makes the story much more authentic-sounding (it would also be strange, indeed, if the narrative were to feature only English words and expressions, as this might give a false impression of implied superiority of the English language, of European-American culture). As a person who loves languages, I really enjoyed not only the liberal use of Spanish throughout the text, but also trying to figure out the meanings of the Spanish words and expressions, and their English counterparts (for the most part, I was quite successful). However, I do wish that Alma Flor Ada had provided a Spanish/English glossary at the back of the book. Some of the Spanish vocabulary and expressions were/are not all that easy to figure out from just the context of the narrative itself and could likely prove a bit confusing and frustrating for both children and adults who do not speak or read Spanish, or whose knowledge of Spanish is limited."
5026,Saturday Night at the Dinosaur Stomp,Carol Diggory Shields,3.9,438,58,Laura,5,"I've read this children's book quite a few times but I never realized I hadn't tracked it on GR so after completing the 50/50 book challenge for this year I placed this here so I don't forget it.It was my Mum who put me onto this book when I worked with a child who LOVED dinosaurs and I mean to the point of high obsession. This book is great for young children because it's got rhymes and lovely colourful pictures illustrating dinosaurs dancing!! Basically it's a story about dinosaurs who are going to have a party,getting ready for it and enjoying the party all night long.It might even help you with naming some of those not so easy dinosaur names..haha! It's also just short but long enough to keep the kids interested. Could even get them into the swing of wanting to do their own rhyme."
1289,How to Talk to Women,Ron Louis,5,5,1,Val Nwosu,5,I don't know where to start. This book is good for beginners or mediocre men that are just starting to talk to women. I assume that is who it is aimed at. The authors of this book don't seem to want to throw a pity party for you or want you to feel that there are forces beyond your control. One of the things they say in this book is that women will never parachute into your backyard and beat down the door to talk to you! It is your job to initiate conversation. They also say not to argue with women because you can lose sight of the goal. Do you want to be with her or argue with her? You can't have both. Great freaking book!
1290,How to Succeed with Women,Ron  Louis,3.81,74,12,Ellie,3,"I feel that I need to explain. Found myself in the relationships isle of the library. Ended up borrowing almost the entire section. I was intrigued. When I came across this book it occurred to me that i should pick it up. Not because I am interested in succeeding with women sexually but because I wanted to compare the advice they gear towards men with the advice they gear towards women.Totally worth the effort. This book does not disappoint in terms of broad generalizations about the female sex. But it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be and there were some great nuggets of advice in here.I found it interesting that most of the books I've read that are geared towards women are about securing a man, moving towards marriage. This was about getting a woman to talk to you. Being successful at getting her into bed. You're on your own after that. But it wasn't one of those books with a ""plan"" and it actually calls out those ridiculous plans we have come to know and love (like the program that teaches men that insulting women will get the hot ones to sleep with you. Umm. Only the insecure hot ones... and insecurity makes your exponentially less hot. I must say that I am pretty hot and if you come up and covertly insult me, I will get annoyed and walk away... bit I digress).So this book was more of a no-bullshit mating guide. But it still approach 'women' as one homogeneous group of mystery beings ... which ... is hilarious. The author *clearly* got it backwards. Women are normal, everyday people. It's the men that are mysterious beings."
1294,How to Survive the IRS: My Battles Against Goliath,Michael Louis Minns,3.6,5,2,Lana,5,"Review for Michael Louis MinnsHow to Survive the IRS My Battles Against GoliathPublished 2001 ISBN 1-56980-170-3 by Barricade Books Inc.This is a fascinating book dealing with the other side of the Internal Revenue Service the side that most us might not encounter but once we have will be very displeased. Let me preface this review with the fact that I used to work for IRS as a clerk and did my job with honesty and integrity and to the best of my knowledge according to the Internal Revenue Manual.Mr. Michael Minns is a renowned trial attorney and has firsthand knowledge at how IRS has stormed in and seized property they were not entitled to, how devious IRS auditors edit interview tapes, lied on reports, stole or altered tax records and best of all how little the IRS employees really know about their own rules and regulations.This book is well written, should be read by everyone who files a tax return or who doesn’t, and should be sure to follow his “not so subtle” advice. He has an enormous history with dealing with litigation and IRS. One of the best things I liked about this book other than its honesty is that when Minns’ refers to a legal term he explains so you don’t have to wonder what it means or shuffle through the book to find his meaning. He writes in a way any lay-man can understand. This is a must read book."
1293,How to Succeed with Men,David Copeland,3,11,1,Chelsea,3,"I think this book gave some really great advice, but it was written by men. I personally think their idea of having casual sex before the commitment conversation is stupid, and most women--especially the ones reading such a book--wouldn't be able to handle the wrong answer after they'd gotten intimate with a new prospect. I think this book is definitely worth reading if you need tips on how to widen the circle of men you have to choose from, but I think you should definitely keep your pants on until you know how serious he is about you."
1292,Kiowa Trail,Louis L'Amour,3.88,1615,52,Tricia Mingerink,5,"I found this on book on tape at a Goodwill store, and of course I snapped it up. I grew up on Louis L'amour westerns. At 14 while most girls were swooning over Pride & Prejudice, I disappeared into shoot 'em up westerns. It had been so long since I read this one, I'd forgotten what happens. In a way, this one is a bit unusual for a Louis L'amour. It is more character driven than most of them, yet there is still plenty of gunfights and fighting. No fist fight, and the mystery of the main character's back story is told in flash backs that break up the main action (since most of that main action is a siege of a town). It also is a tad unusual in how it ends, but I won't give that away."
1295,"The Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children, #1)",Jean M. Auel,4.02,189414,5217,Corey,4,"The thing that strikes me most about her work is that every time there's a new discovery about how paleolithic people lived, it goes along with her stories. Things they said were silly back when she wrote it (Neanderthals with instruments, Neanderthals living with homo sapiens sapiens, and the like) keep proving true. She presents interesting ideas of cognition, culture and how societies develop. The first two books are her best I think. The rest remain interesting if you can deal with the constant repetition, soft core porn and the fact that Ayla discovers everything but cold fusion. Clan of the Cave Bear is an incredible, courageous story. The author spent a lot of time hanging out with some of the world's most noted paleontologists doing her research- and she knows her stuff!"

2868,The Golden Tulip,Rosalind Laker,3.9,926,97,Linda,5,"When I first read the description of this story I had the smarts not to read anyone else's review. I enjoyed what I read beforehand and I didn't want other people to tarnish my opinion. I think if I had read someone's less-than-five-star review, I would not have considered reading the book. And I am glad I did this because THE GOLDEN TULIP was such a rich and honored narrative with considerable depth. So, if you have read the publisher's depiction and you think this is a story you might want to read, STOP HERE. Read the story!-------------My Review:I will start with the biggest drawback. The hardcover I read was 585 pages with small print. The actual size of the book was not overly large but you could have easily used it to press flowers. The story was historical fiction mixed with real characters that lived during the 1600's in Holland, a former province of the Netherlands. Francesca Visser, a young woman, wanted to become an artist in the truest sense: a Master Painter. This was a serious profession if you had money and influence to seek an apprenticeship. It was also the story of the three men that affected her the most.Her papa, the artist Hendrick Visser, was a fifty-something year old man with the attitude of a self-absorbent boy. His moodiness, excessive drinking and gambling habit affected his household all the time. He controlled the money but required his wife, and then Francesca, to pay the bills. This issue was a constant source of anxiety.Then there was the sordid, degenerative Ludolf van Deventer, her father's patron and a man whom lusted after Francesca. He was determined that nothing would stop him from possessing her. NOTHING. The best way to describe him? Think of oily sandpaper running over your skin.Lastly, there was the kindly Pieter van Doorne. From the first moment he saw Francesca, he knew in his heart she was someone special. He was a horticulturalist before the term came into being. He tended to his bulbs and landscaped to make ends meet. As strongly as Francesca wanted to become a Master Painter, Pieter had a deep passion for growing flowers. Because he understood her intentness, he respected Francesca. And with a fierceness he had never felt before, he loved her.Francesca's sisters, Aletta and Sybella, tug and push the plot along. There were two wonderful secondary stories in the second half of the book when they reach adulthood. You will also 'meet' Rembrandt and Johannes Vermeer with all their idiosyncrasies. I am not an expert on art but there was a time or two that I wondered if Ms. Laker took some liberties. On the flip side, the author took great care in bringing these people, along with all the others, to life.THE GOLDEN TULIP was very much a character-driven story. It contained espionage, family drama and romance with some surprising men. Until now, the closest I have come to enjoying a book from this general era was THE TINNER'S BRIDE by Irene Northan. Like that story, TGT won me over with five stars."
2871,Burning Bright,Tracy Chevalier,3.34,11069,1231,Shan O,3,"I have long enjoyed Tracy Chevalier's historical novels, particularly ""Girl With a Pearl Earring,"" which imagines the daily home life and creative process of 17th century Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer, as viewed from the vantage point of a teenage, Protestant maid. This more recent book,""Burning Bright,"" is set in 18th century Lambeth, a suburb of London, and imagines the public life and creative mind of painter and poet William Blake, seen through the eyes of two adolescents. While both books are entertaining and show good evidence of the author's grasp of the context in which each of these artists found himself, the former novel stands out above ""Burning Bright"" in terms of its character development and the richness of the setting. While Chevalier's symbolism tends to be heavy-handed in both books, she does have a gift for evoking the sense of place and time in which her novels are located, and she offers fairly well-rounded (though not dynamic) characters whose relationships are complicated and unpredictable. She has a knack for revealing something about the now-famous artists in her novels by surrounding them with rich characters and interesting locations. Vermeer's growing family includes a roiling gaggle of children, a spoiled and demanding wife, and a business-woman for a mother-in-law; these people, not to mention Vermeer's men friends, help the reader to gain a sense of Vermeer by looking at those with whom he surrounds himself in his most private moments. We see Blake by coming to know his rather taciturn wife, Catherine; the two young people who follow him even to his mother's funeral across town; the neighbors who are suspicious of him for being so insular and odd; and Lambeth's pro-monarchy association, whose members try to bully Blake into supporting their cause; these characters help the author depict the political and social side of Blake's life, giving us less insight into his private world. In any case, Chevalier's Vermeer and Blake both benefit from the swirl of life going on all around them.What makes ""Burning Bright"" less compelling a read than the novel about Vermeer is the distance she keeps from Blake. In her earlier novel, she brings her heroine, Griet, the Protestant maid, directly into the Vermeer household, where we can see him in action as an artist and as a husband and father; we do not get this view of Blake. Instead, Blake is spied on by an Jem and Maggie, who imagine him to be strange and curious and who come to know him during the course of the novel as strange, creative, and caring. While Chevalier attempts to narrate Blake's creative process, the reader never gets enough continuity from the various scenes that show him, in one moment, having conversations with his dead brother, Robert, and, in another moment, etching a copper plate for eventual use in the printing press. While we get a sense of what makes Vermeer tick, we never gain that knowledge about Blake. This could be less Chevalier's failing than it is the reality that Blake was truly enigmatic and odd, set apart in his ways from the mainstream of British art and writing even as he wrote and drew, etched and painted his way into history (and anthologies and museums!). If I am to be bluntly honest, I must admit that it is, perhaps, my own knowledge of Blake, more than it is Chevalier's writing, that makes me view the novel as weak. Having written more than enough of my own about Blake and his work, I probably know too much to enjoy Chevalier's development of Blake's character and creative process. In my mind, he is not quite the same man that she depicts on the novel's pages. I suppose I'll have to write my own novel in order to understand the Blake I think I know!"
1884,The Gulf War Did Not Take Place,Jean Baudrillard,3.63,326,24,Spoust1,4,"Three essays: ""The Gulf War Will Not Take Place,"" ""The Gulf War Is Not Taking Place,"" ""The Gulf War Did Not Take Place."" Baudrillard argues that the First Gulf War was a media construction - not that it did not take place, exactly, but that it did not exist for us at all except through the media, which packaged it to us falsely, depicting it as a ""war."" What happened was a travesty, simple imperialist brutality, masquerading as a war - that is what he's saying. Baudrillard's argument is coldly ironic, never making use of a humanistic lexicon. This is intentional: his dry tone is accusatory. His tone forces us to confront the terrifying fact that an attitude of utter indifference to something such as ""the Gulf War"" is absolutely possible for those of us in the post-industrial, wealthiest sectors of the world. That is our isolation, our alienation. The scariest line in the book: ""A simple calculation shows that, of the 500,000 American soldiers involved during the seven months of operations in the Gulf, three times as many would have died from road accidents alone had they stayed in civilian life. Should we consider multiplying clean wars in order to reduce the murderous death toll of peacetime?"""

Confession...this book gave me an earth-shattering Janeaustegasm and I am feeling a bit spent and vulnerable at the moment, so please bear with me.

The question was where to begin.After sherlocking through my Easton Press collection, I started by pulling out my Dickens and reading A Tale of Two Cities which I thought was jaw-dropping AMAZO and left me feeling warm, satisfied and content. It also made me made retrospectively pleased that I named my youngest daughter Sydney.After Two City “Tale”ing, I decided to give this book a whirl as I kept seeing it on GR lists of ""goodest books ever."" However, I must admit I was hesitant going in to this for two big reasons. One, I thought it might be a bit too romantical for me. The second, and much more distressing, reason was that Twilight was on many of the same lists as this book. Austen fans should pull a nutty over that one.So needless to say I went into this thinking I might hate it. Well, for the 999,987th time in my life (at least according to my wife’s records)...I was wrong!!! I absolutely loved this book and had a mammoth, raging heart-on for it from the opening scene at the breakfast table when Father Witty (Mr. Bennet) is giving sly sarcasm to Mrs. Mommie Put Upon. I literaphorically could not get enough of this story. I was instantly captivated by the characters and Elizabeth Bennet, the main protagonist, immediately became one of my all time favorite characters. Mr. Darcy joined that party as soon as he showed up in the narrative as I thought he was terrific as well.Overall, the writing could not have been better. It was descriptive, lush and brilliant. The story could not have been more engaging or intelligent and the characters could not have been more magnificentastic. Elizabeth and Fitz are both smart, witty, self-confident and good. Austen could not have written them better. Oh, and I am sorry if this is a bit of a minor spoiler but I need to add that George Wickham is a cock-blocking braggadouche of startling proportions. I needed to say that and now I feel better. This one has made it onto my list of All Time Favorite novels and is truly one of the classics that lives up to its billing.

1887,The Making of Pride and Prejudice,Sue Birtwistle,4.42,3585,91,Hannah,4,"While Downton Abbey has certainly deserved all the praise that's been heaped on it recently, there was another TV sensation over 15 years ago that caused another tsunami of fan fever, and probably had a huge impact on all the Austen (as well as other classic) book-to-film adaptations produced since 1995.Pride and Prejudice remains one of the most highly loved books of all time, and this adaptation remains, IMO, the best adaptation (regardless of the teeny tiny fact that Colin Firth was too chubby to be  my Mr. Darcy....sorry, it's true, ladies) :pAfter recently finishing the excellent The World of Downton Abbey, I pulled this book out of my TBR pile so that I could immerse myself in another ""behind-the-scenes"" companion book. Unlike the Downton Abbey book, this book focused exclusively on the film production of the P&P mini-series, and gave the reader a very in-depth look at what it took to pull it off. My favorite part of the entire book focused on the owner of the house they used for the Bennett family. Her observations over having her home rented out for several months was fascinating (she continued living in a small corner of the house during the entire production). She seemed like a lovely, gracious lady, and I was happy to learn that she used some of the proceeds of the rental of her house to fix the roof after it was all done.An entertaining read; recommended for fans of the mini (and it paid off to wait over 2 years for this to finally become available from my paperbackswap wishlist) :D"

8506,Thomas Jefferson,R.B. Bernstein,3.98,3730,139,Suzanne,3,"After reading 1776, George Washington and John Adams, I was ready to expound upon my knowledge of our third President and writer of the Declaration of Independence. Thomas Jefferson is an immortal hero for Americans, and often that status comes with a lofty purity that is difficult to actually live up to. In R. B. Bernstein’s abbreviated biography, I felt I got to know the real person that Jefferson was, rather than the icon.Jefferson was clearly a passionate man. He had a love for learning and enjoyed erudite discussions with knowledgeable men of his time. He even extended those discussion’s to Abigail Adams, but it is fairly clear that, like most men of his era, he felt that women were of an inferior mind to men. His passions, however got him into trouble. He would stand firm on an issue (for instance his belief in a very limited Federal Government), write scathing critiques of anyone who disagreed with him, and later, when he had to bend his own beliefs (for example, when he approved the Louisiana Purchase although many in Congress felt this power was not granted to the Federal Government) his public would never let him live it down. He clearly was not the pragmatic man that Washington or even Adams was.Jefferson wrote much about his dislike of slavery and felt that it should be abolished. Yet he owned hundreds of slaves and never set a single one free. I believe it was likely a weakness of character. Jefferson wanted to create an image of being one of the planter elite, and so he continually burdened himself with large debts. The assets with which he could guarantee payment of those debts, included his slaves, and he likely felt that freeing them would make him appear untrustworthy (as opposed to the honorable gentleman he wished to be perceived as) to his creditors.Regardless of his personal shortcomings, his gifts to Americans (and mankind) are immeasurable. The concept of a republic, free from aristocratic rule, and freedom for all men is one that has spread like wildfire across the globe. Jefferson didn’t come up with the idea, but he helped to promote it. His words in our Declaration of Independence have been used to establish new democracies in other countries. Thomas Jefferson was a Governor of Virginia, the first U.S. Secretary of State,and our 3rd U.S. President. He founded the University of Virginia, established lucrative trade treaties and more than doubled the size of the United States.While this is by no means a definitive biography, it’s a good start. There was a six volume biography written by a historian in the 1980′s, but given the fact that there are over 40,000 letters written by or received by Jefferson, it’s a monumental task for any biographer. 3 1/2 stars."
6330,The Best of Roald Dahl,Roald Dahl,4.38,5971,406,Praveen,5,"This book is collection of 20 stories of Roald Dahl. Longest Story is ‘Claud’s Dog’ and Shortest Story is ‘Dip in the pool’. Here are some brief points, I wish to say for now, but I am emphatically going to talk about this book and his writing in greater detail later ! -His stories are very offbeat and of different styles.-This writer gave me goosebumps many times.-These stories lingered on my mind for long.-His stories are full of twists and turns.-I could not put it down in between.-Unexpected ends are common.-Language is very captivating.-Its exotic and enticing.-It touched me. `"
6335,Never Let Me Go,Kazuo Ishiguro,3.8,328518,22297,Trevor,5,"It is a pity that people are told this is a science fiction book before they read it. I feel the least interesting thing about it is that it is science fiction. I mean this in much the same way that the least interesting thing one could say about 1984 is that it is science fiction. As a piece of literature I enjoyed it much more than Margaret Atwood's Oryx and Crake and even more than Huxley's Brave New World. The themes that make this book most interesting are to do with the social alienation of groups of people on the basis of inherited genetic characteristics. In fact, as a critique of racism this book is utterly brilliant. Those being racially alienated are genetically identical (they are in fact clones) to those attacking them.Plato believed those 'in the know' should tell lies to those 'who do not know' so as to protect them from the all too horrible truths about life. I have always hated this aspect of Plato, always finding it grotesque and frightening in its implications. Those implications are drawn out in all their disturbing horror here. This book has much to say about the nature of 'illness' and how those inflicted with an 'illness' use the scars of that illness as the badges of truly belonging to the group. So that those 'less advanced' in the ravages of the illness don't really know or really belong to the group. As a portrait of victims adopting to being victims it says much about us as humans - thoughtful readers may find it says far too much. I write this on World Aids Day.Ishiguro writes the most nightmarish novels I've ever read. In others, such as The Unconsoled or  When We Were Orphans the nightmare feeling is due to the dreamlike oddity of the interconnection of events in the story. One reads these books in much the same way that one wakes from a disturbing dream, with feelings of disorientation and anxiety. Even though this is the most literal 'nightmare book' of his I have read - the world he creates being literally a nightmare, and made all the worse by being set in the recent past - it is a book totally lacking in that strange dreamlike quality so characteristic of these other novels. In this sense it seemed less of a nightmare than these others. If you struggled with these, you will not struggle with this in quite the same way.He also has fascinating and quite painful things to say about the nature of love and how love has a proper time, a time that may be lost or missed. As someone who has loved, lost and missed I found this particularly challenging. The relationship between sex and love and illness is perhaps something people may find simply too much - not because this is handled in any way that is too explicit, but because I do believe we like to think that sex, as a manifestation of love, has curative and redemptive powers. A book that questions this, questions something we hold very dear and some readers may find this too much to ask.This is also a book about betrayal. The betrayals we commit against those we love the most and yet that we barely can understand or explain after we have committed them - these are constant throughout the book. He is a writer all too aware of the human condition. The scene which gives the book its title is a wonderful example of the near impossibility of our being understood by others and yet our endless desire for just such an understanding.There is nothing easy about reading this book - although it is written in the simplest of prose. It has an honesty of feeling that brands one's soul.I loved this book and have thought about it a lot since I finished reading it and will think about it more. There is much more I would like to say, but there is no space. May we all be good carers before we complete."
6333,The Vicar of Nibbleswicke,Roald Dahl,3.83,3477,280,El,4,"This is a very dramatic story of a man who overcame a terrible bout of dyslexia as a child only for the disorder to return when he arrives in Nibbleswicke to become the town vicar. Someone slap an Oprah sticker on this book. Character overcoming great odds and obstacles? Heartwarming, touching, grab a hanky!I'm kidding; the book is 22 pages (24 if you count Quentin Blake's Afterword), so there is no time for drama. But it is an adorable book, and there is some tension and awkwardness as Reverend Robert Lee tries to have regular conversation or (worse!) when he holds a sermon. But he doesn't know his words come out backwards! Zaniness ensues! The good townspeople are at turns concerned, amused, and horrified at some of the things that come out of his mouth. Silly Reverend Robert Lee!I adore Roald Dahl, especially when he's paired with Quentin Blake's illustrations. Two of my favorite people, together again! Look at all the exclamation points in this review! Excitement!There's not a lot to say about such a short tome, but it was worth all 45 seconds it took me to read it and I highly recommend it for Dahl-lovers and kidlets alike. I can't give it a full 5 stars because there was little-to-no character development."
1590,Peace,Aristophanes,3.64,291,16,Bruce,4,"Aristophanes staged this Old Comedy in Athens in 421 BCE when the Peloponnesian War was still dragging on and the Athenian citizens were exhausted and war-weary. Their leader Creon, the butt of much of Aristophanes’ satire in his previous works, had just died. The play anticipated and celebrated the peace which seemed to be just over the horizon, but it also emphasized the societal splits and ambivalences on the parts of the state who had vested interests in keeping the conflict going.Trygaeus, an Athenian citizen, decides to fly to Zeus and convince the god that peace is desired and necessary. His only means of transportation is a giant dung beetle that he has purchased, the play’s opening depicting his servants molding pies of excrement to feed the beetle. Trygaeus succeeds in flying on the beast to heaven, only to find it deserted of almost all the Olympian court except for Hermes, War, and Peace, whom War has sealed up in a cave. War leaves temporarily, and Trygaeus convinces Hermes to assist the Greeks in freeing Peace. The crowd works at cross-purposes to remove the rocks imprisoning Peace, the citizens of some city-states pulling in one direction, those of others in a different direction, some citizens being vigorous, others being lazy. Finally Peace is freed and, with her companion Festival, is returned to earth where Trygaeus weds her. In the course of the narrative Aristophanes includes not just the traditional single parabasis for the chorus (an extended passage addressing the audience) but two. The sizable latter portion of the play describes preparations for the wedding and the peace that comes to Greece. This time is itself fraught with some dissention because various arms manufacturers and others who have gained as the result of the war are unhappy with this outcome, the internal situation in Athens mirroring the tensions and conflicting agendas that existed across Greece among the various war-time participants.As is characteristic of Aristophanes’ plays, this one is highly satirical, ribald, and often scatological, pointedly skewering contemporary politicians, writers, philosophers, and other public figures. It is never surprising to learn that he was often in hot water with Athenian authorities. He is clearly unimpressed by the gods, who have little interest in what is going on down on earth. Except for Hermes as a somewhat reluctant facilitator, none of the gods plays a significant role in the human conflict or its solution. An edition of the play that includes notes clarifying all these personages is most helpful.This is a delightful and very funny play whose underlying messages can easily be applied to our own world, our own societies, and our own national and international struggles and conflicts. Aristophanes reputation rests not only on his immediate skill as a writer of comedy but also on his insights into perpetual common political problems and issues that occur in all ages."
1589,Three Comedies: The Birds/The Clouds/The Wasps,Aristophanes,3.74,117,12,Matt,3,"I don't think anybody cares how I rate Aristophanes: people have been enjoying his plays for two millennia, so it's safe to say the verdict is in. Instead I'm going to rate the modern Aristophanes translations, the quality of which is highly variable. Slang and bawdry seem to be the hardest things to translate, more on account of the people who tend to become translators, I think -- especially translators of ancient Greek -- than of the difficulties inherent in approximating lively foulness. In English Aristophanes has suffered pretty badly; you have to really dig for a translation that conveys why the ancients enjoyed this guy so much. Disclaimer: I don't know Greek, so I can only judge how these translations read in English - and make no mistake, these are all in English English: it's 'bloody' this and 'bugger' that, with 'poofters' and 'bumboys' galore, which sound to this American like the sort of imprecations you let fly when the waitstaff at Gordon Ramsay serves you some ill-blackened swordfish. But I didn't deduct points for Britishness -- not even for all the 'arses', which I have no idea what to do with -- only for stuff that'd be lousy in any dialect. Meineck: ABartlett & Sommerstein: BTheodoridis: B Einhorn (Lysistrata): C+ (his Lampito is straight out of 'Bamboozled')Halliwell: CArrowsmith, Parker, and Lattimore: D-Henderson: FRuden: Oof. In the words of Dean Vernon Wormer - ""Zero point zero.""Meineck only did these three plays, so until he gives us an ""Aristophanes II"" we're stuck with the OK Bartlett & Sommerstein and the slightly unhinged Theodoridis (""Because, by Salty Poseidon, we are so piss-weak ourselves!""). Feel free to take a crayon and a sense of humor to their pages, however: I've found that if you tune up the B&S or give the Theodoridis some Ritalin, they both read decently well. And they are worth reading: Aristophanes is great!"
8708,"Mostly Harmless (Hitchhiker's Guide, #5)",Douglas Adams,3.96,84481,1843,Jon,3,"Mostly Harmless was, for many people, a disappointing end to a fantastic series. Adams admitted that he was having a ""bad year"" when he wrote this book, and it shows: the usual humor and manic pacing are largely gone, replaced by long tracts about actual theoretical science (as opposed to the lunatic-inspired science that created, say, the starship Bistromath), and the tone overall is far darker and more depressive. There are still glimpses of Adams' comedic genius, but the book as a whole is a definite cog or two down the scale from the first four. While Mostly Harmless does provide a firm and definite conclusion to the Hitchhiker's Trilogy, it can, in many ways, be left off the reading list for anyone who is not a die-hard Adams fan; the average reader will get enough conclusion from So Long..., if not from Life...."
8713,Point to Point Navigation,Gore Vidal,3.72,682,100,MJ Nicholls,3,"Disappointerissimo. This memoir is meant to cover Gore’s life from 1968-2006, but unlike its predecessor Palimpsest, fails to offer an entertaining and comprehensive account of the Great Wit’s activities during these four pregnant decades. First off, the chapters are unpardonably bitesize—lacking in detail and conversational digressionism familiar to Gorehounds—and second off, Gore discusses his childhood at length (heard it!) and, seemingly, whatever interests him at the moment of writing. The non-linear sprawl that worked so well in Palimpsest here is simply unfocused and far too casually anecdotal. The bitesize approach leaves many chapters feeling like responses to questions posed by interviewers, as Gore freestyles long or short answers depending on what pops up in the memory hole, and although we itch ourselves impatiently for facts-presented-chronologically, we lap it up like the snivelling Gorehounds we is.

My first encounters were in my final years of boarding school: I heard much of the original BBC radio series and loved them. I read the books as soon as they came out, saw the TV series (mostly the same cast as the radio) and saw a stage version that was the funniest and most anarchic thing I'd ever seen in a theatre. They remained deeply ingrained in my mind, closely entwined with fond memories of school; I reread them occasionally. Then a film version came out; it wasn't as good, but opened the door of the books to my son, so I enjoyed them in a new way, followed, a few years later, by a new stage version, by which time my son was a young adult, and enjoying it at a new level.The Answer is 42Of course, 6 x 9 is NOT 42... except in base 13.

9875,Grimus,Salman Rushdie,3.39,2516,165,Petra Eggs,1,"This is a horrible book. Not even the author rates it! It is interesting only because Rushdie plays around with the magical realism that will play a major part in his writing and touches on themes he will later explore in much greater depth.I don't recommend anyone who is thinking of reading Rushdie to think that as this is one of his shorter ones it would be a good one to start with, it really isn't a good read. Rather go for Shame with the wonderfully drawn character of the Virgin Ironpants (Benazir Bhutto). Now that book would make anyone want to explore more Rushdie.Recommended to writers: knowing that Rushdie won the Booker of Bookers for his magnificent book Midnight's Children should give you hope that even if your first book flops (because it is crap) there is still hope, you can still aim for the top and know that it's possible to reach there.Read back '96ish, reviewed Nov 2012, edited February 2013. Why does this awful book stick in my head?"
9873,Dangling Man,Saul Bellow,3.54,1873,147,Lisa,4,"What happens if you are caught between two commitments?If you have time to look at the world from an unoccupied position? What will you see?What will you discover of our common humanity?Are you still engaged in the questions your generation asks, if you are not actively participating?Can you understand the world better while you are inside it, or do you need to establish distance between yourself and everyday business to define its essence?If it requires you to step out to see the patterns, but you are not part anymore, does that mean that you can’t be part of humanity and understand it at the same time? Catch 22?“I have a right to be spoken to!” yells the protagonist at one point, utterly frustrated with the reaction of his environment to the fact that he resigns from his work in order to join the army, but remains in a vacuum while waiting for the official procedures to take place.Thinking is a way of communicating, but it also separates the reality of one human being from another. Having a lot of time to think and observe is enlightening, and incredibly depressing.The protagonist goes through alienation from different groups, first in his head, then in verbal outbursts, which constitute the last reactions in a long chain of causes and effects in his mind, but come as a complete surprise to his family and friends, who do not follow his preceding thoughts, and only judge the ultimate anger and frustration he shows. Family, friends, Communist party, social groups, all are reevaluated from the perspective of an outsider.“Preferring embarrassment and pain to indifference”, the lonely man starts to pick fights within the family and in the local environment to feel part of it, to feel real.Between the outbursts of desperation, some interesting discussions temporarily lighten his mood:What is life? What is worthwhile? Is it meaningful to continue carrying out nonsensical tasks, justified by the prestige of a workplace in a 53 storey building? Or is the only important work in the world that of art and imagination… ?The novel is written in the form of a diary moving between long philosophical reflections, in the spirit of “the wretched must suffer”, and short unimportant entries, filling in the banalities of life: “January 16th, fairly quiet day”, thus showing the swinging back and forth of feelings and thoughts.As the alienation from the active world grows, the questions in the diary become more urgent:“You can’t banish the world by decree if it is in you!” Self reflection is part of the development as well, and recognition of the narrator’s own arrogance in categorising people according to those who have worthwhile ideas and those who don’t. Part of the issue is the anonymous urban trauma: lack of human spirit in the too overwhelming, crowded human, treeless world of the city, leading to longing for nature as a means to rediscover humanity.In an act of hopelessness, the protagonist gives up his lonely freedom and speeds up the process to join the army, recognising a defeat in front of himself and the freedom he could not handle:“I had not done well alone!”On his last civilian day, he exclaims: “I am no longer to be held accountable for myself, freedom cancelled.”“Long live reglementation!”Worthwhile read, very sad, I would have wished for him to cherish the rare opportunity to have time to think and be creative, but I guess the message is true in essence: Man cannot live with others, and not alone either. Happiness is a very thin line between the two opposites, and it is easy to lose balance, both inside and outside the hamster wheel of daily occupation!"
3363,Angle of Repose,Wallace Stegner,4.27,42838,3621,Steve,5,"Fellow Goodreaders know that feeling of exhilaration when a new entrant pushes its way onto a top-ten-of-all-time list. Wallace Stegner’s Pulitzer Prize winner from 1972 is my most recent example. Of course, Goodreads reviewers also know the pressure involved in justifying the choice. So what makes this one so good? As befits a top ten inclusion, here are ten factors that come to mind. 1. A Damn Good StoryLyman Ward is a former professor of history with a bone disease that put him in a wheelchair. He moved into his grandparents’ house in California where he’d spent much of his boyhood. With a strong personal interest and a research historian’s skills, he studied the lives of his grandmother, Susan, and his grandfather, Oliver. She was an artist and later a writer transplanted from her genteel life in New York to be with her husband, the earnest engineer, out West. He specialized in big projects: mines, irrigation canals, etc. His integrity prevented the material success he would have liked as a source of comfort for Susan. She created what culture she could in mining towns, and had become known for her illustrations and magazine articles about life in the West. Stegner had permission to use real letters of a writer and painter from that era, lending the narrative an authentic voice. As their family dramas unfolded, Lyman had a few related episodes of self-discovery, all very cleverly done.2. Complex Characters What book could ever be considered great without an interesting cast? These players were decidedly not stick figures – more like Rubenesque (actually, that’s not the exact opposite I was going for, but you know what I mean). Starting out, Lyman seemed like a stock character – the crusty recluse – but he becomes more central and more nuanced as the book goes on. The way we see his grandparents through his eyes tells us a lot about him. To be honest, early in his narration I was put off by his invented dialog and false omniscience, but later, after he copped to this as a way to make them more real, I actually liked the device. All the characters, the ones on the periphery included, seemed very credible, with emotions that rang true and unexpected depths that only a first-rate writer could have imagined.3. Interesting HistoryIt’s an impressive laundry list of things the curious reader can learn more about: technology of the time (from Oliver’s various engineering projects), culture (the arts community in NY, pioneer life in the West, the opulent part of Mexico where Susan and Oliver almost stayed for a job), and manners (subtle social conventions, shady business dealings, dirty politics). Lyman, with his background in history, was a very knowledgeable narrator. He had remarkable tunnel vision (literally, since his disease prevented him from turning his head) trained on his subjects.4. Conflict Clashes were easy to come by when the refined East (civilized society) met the rough-and-tumble West (opportunity). Tightrope walks were performed between desire and moral responsibility, the practical and the romantic, and in the case of Lyman and a curvy young assistant, the stodgy academic and the free-spirited hippie. There was conflict in Lyman’s concept of himself, too. Was he more like his grandmother or grandfather? It turned out to be a key question.5. Blissful(?) InstitutionsThe give-and-take of a marriage was a central theme. Susan was described as “more lady than woman” and Oliver was “more man than gentleman.” This made for some tension. As Stegner himself said in a Paris Review interview: Susan is more talented in many ways than Oliver. She shows off better. But while I wrote that book, thinking that I was writing about her as a heroine, I came to the end of it thinking maybe he is the hero because there is a flaw in her, a flaw of snobbery. She doesn’t adequately appreciate the kind of person he is, or the kind of work he does. That’s a story not about either men or women, but about a relationship, a novel about a marriage.On top of this, Lyman reflected on his own former marriage. Would he forgive his ex-wife for what she did to him? Should he have done more to prevent it from happening in the first place? More good questions both for him and for us.6. Metaphorical Resonance “Angle of repose” is an engineering term referring to the angle at which rocks and soil settle when tumbling down off a slope before coming to a stop. Lyman’s goal was to see “how two such unlike particles clung together, and under what strains, rolling downhill into their future until they reached the angle of repose where I knew them.” Another way to think of it may be as the point at which the slights that we suffer lose their animating force and finally give way to acceptance.Stegner spells out a second metaphor so well that I’m willing to risk further attention-squelching length to include it. There is another physical law that teases me, too: the Doppler Effect. The sound of anything coming at you – a train, say, or the future – has a higher pitch than the sound of the same thing going away. If you have perfect pitch and a head for mathematics you can compute the speed of the object by the interval between its arriving and departing sounds. I have neither perfect pitch nor a head for mathematics, and anyway who wants to compute the speed of history? Like all falling bodies, it constantly accelerates. But I would like to hear your life as you heard it, coming at you, instead of hearing it as I do, a somber sound of expectations reduced, desires blunted, hopes deferred or abandoned, chances lost, defeats accepted, griefs borne.7. Powerful DescriptionsWhat was clever here was how natural it was for Susan, the artist, to describe and even embellish the new sights she would see out West. Her eye for detail never got tedious. Of course, we know to credit Stegner for excluding any word that didn’t pull its weight. There were countless little analogies, too, that made for a pleasant experience. For example: “Bunion footed, wearing her look of a supposedly house-broken dog which is called upon to explain a puddle on the floor, Mrs. Briscoe labored toward them.”8. Organic Philosophy I like reading bigger thoughts, but less so when they’re without context. If they appear as natural outgrowths of a story or a character profile, I’m all in. With A of R I’m spoiled for choice looking for examples. Here are a few, ranging from aphorism and homily: It is an easy mistake to think that non-talkers are non-feelers. You'll do what you think you want to do, or what you think you ought to do. If you're very lucky, luckier than anybody I know, the two will coincide.  Home is a notion that only the nations of the homeless fully appreciate and only the uprooted comprehend.  Civilizations grow by agreements and accommodations and accretions, not by repudiations. The rebels and the revolutionaries are only eddies, they keep the stream from getting stagnant but they get swept down and absorbed, they're a side issue. Quiet desperation is another name for the human condition. If revolutionaries would learn that they can't remodel society by day after tomorrow -- haven't the wisdom to and shouldn't be permitted to -- I'd have more respect for them ... Civilizations grow and change and decline -- they aren't remade.9. Awfully Good WritingI may have made my case already with the examples I’ve included, but let me add that this is more than just pretty language we’re talking about here. There’s plenty of substance to it, too. To my mind, Stegner is a true master of the craft. Every sentence has heft, yet never at the expense of flow. Early on I thought Stegner is like a grown-up when so many others are mere children in comparison. His candle-power shines brightly on every page.10. Opportunities for Growth Hokeyness aside, how many books do you read and wonder, “Gee willikers, am I possibly becoming a better person?” If you’re drawn to intelligence, please give Lyman, his grandparents, and most of all Stegner a try. If cumulative insight into human experience floats your boat, ships ahoy. "

2494,The Time Machine,H.G. Wells,3.87,308714,7538,Beth F.,3,"One of the most difficult courses I took in college was a class called Sociological Theory. The professor was either brilliant or a total nut, I’m still not sure, and one of the questions for our final exam was actually: Why? (Use diagrams to support your response).Ugh, ugh, ugh!!! I walked out of that class with a B and I kid you not, I have never worked so hard for a B in my life! I pity the one guy in my class who walked away with an A and don’t even want to think about what his social life was like during that semester because I know mine was down the tubes.At one point, the kooky prof mentioned The Time Machine as some interesting (but not required) reading to pick up on the side. But since he already had us reading upwards of 1,000 pages a week and we were required to hand in a 7-10 page paper every Monday (just for the one class!!!!), I was like, “screw you! H.G. Wells can kiss my ass!” And that’s the funny thing about regret. Because now I’m wishing I’d have made time in my busy schedule to read it. Maybe I should have blown off another class for a couple hours so I could have read The Time Machine. And then I could have thought about it in a state of mind that was open and receptive to what was being said and layering it with some weird, academic extrapolations and connections (the kind professors slurp up) and it would become something ultra-meaningful and profound. Or something. But no, I read it now. At age 29. Because I was dragging my feet and didn’t feel like finishing the book I’m supposed to be reading about Al Qaeda. And so the entire time I was reading it, I was like, “hm, interesting. If I was a younger person and still remembered the specific details about theories I studied in my past life as a student, the ideas in this book would have given me a nerd brain orgasm. And hot diggity damn! This book would have made a fantastic paper for my Soc. Theory class! By referencing several schools of sociological thought and combining those with discussions of evolution, social deconstruction and combining all that with the social norms of Victorian peoples—that would have knocked that prof’s socks off!""So anyway. I liked this book okay. I’m really not a huge science fiction fan and that aspect probably kept me from getting into it as much as I could have given its potential for creating nerd brain o’s. Plus, it was only 90 pages long. It’s hard to really get into something that’s that short. Parts of the story felt like they weren’t fleshed out enough and Wells seemed to have skimmed over several scenes that shouldn’t have been skimped on. But then I found out that his original intent for this story was to turn it into a full-fledged novel but that just never happened due to some financial burdens and it sort of made sense.The basic plot revolves around a Victorian gentleman and his theories about time travel. To prove them, he builds a machine and travels 800,000 years into the future where he befriends a group of people, the Eloi, who are descended from modern human beings. They are much shorter, childlike people who only eat fruit and spend most of their day playing games. They have no concept of work, they have no critical thinking skills and are incapable of logical reaction to problems. They are also terrified of the dark. After spending a few days with them, the Time Traveler discovers another distinct species, also descended from modern man but of a much more sinister nature. This second group lives underground, only comes out at night, is a bit more cunning than the gentle people who live aboveground and this group is also extremely predatory in that they cannibalize the Eloi. These are the Morlocks. The Time Traveler has several adventures during his time spent amongst the Eloi and the Morlocks and towards the end of the story, Wells makes some fairly blatant comparisons between the Eloi and the ultra-rich of our own society. If they spend their entire days being attended to by others, they will lose the ability to care for themselves and if they’re not careful, over the course of time and evolution of the species, they could turn into the Eloi, a group of wimpy wimpsters upon whom a life of privilege has backfired."
2491,Learning to Love: Exploring Solitude and Freedom (The Journals of Thomas Merton Vol. 6),Thomas Merton,4.47,95,11,Greg Talbot,5,"""Being a songwriter is like being a nun: You're married to a mystery."" - Leonard Cohen.Conflicted between the path of marrying a woman or continuing his vows in the monastic life, Jesuit priest James Martin made the coments:""when you enter the religious order, you don’t check your sexuality at the door. You fall in love. And my novice director said, “And if people don’t fall in love with you, something’s wrong because you’re living a loving life, and we’re human beings.” And actually, I was horrified. I thought, “Oh, my gosh, what if I fall in love?” Not that love is a bad thing, but this would be terrible. And I did. I fell in love in a very deep way, and I had to make a decision"" (http://www.onbeing.org/program/james-...)Martin, in many ways is a successor of Thomas Merton. He referencing Merton's seminal work ""The Seven Storey Mountain"" as the point at which he left a career in corporate finance and entered the Jesuit order. Like Merton, he has stature in the community, a well known name, and one whose flock extends the confines of a tradtiional church home.""Learning to Love"" is a collectd of journal entries from 1966-1967, in which Merton describes his falling in love with a young woman, and honoring his commitment as an man who has abandoned the world. We meet him when he is 25 years in, at 51 years of age, and already a prominent Catholic leader. With earnestness, and provactiveness, his journal entries show a conflict that tests his faith and his biology:""I have no intention of keeping the M. business entirely out of sight. I have always wanted to be completely open, both about my mistaken and about my effort to make sense out of my life. The affair with M. is an important part of i - and shows my limitations as well as a side of me that is - well, it needsto be known too, for it is part of me. M need for love, my loneliness, my inner division, the struggle in which a solitude is once a problem and a ""solution"".It's not so simple as walking away from a love interest. Merton details his distaste for the stiffling head abbott and his joylessness, he confronts his own confuson about what good he is doing in the woods of Kentucky, and seeks spiritual understanding in constraints that deny him a greater happiness. Throughout this book he tests his ways to a relationship with M. Asking God for acceptence to do so, and testing conventional ways to leave the brotherhood in good graces.One of the joys of the book is Merton's inexhorable seeking of God in all things. We never doubt his faith, as he states: ""I have no hestiation in firmly desiring and intending 'to be a Catholic and to hold all my herat to the truth faith of the living God manifested in Christ and in his Church. And no monkeying! Amen. Whatever I seek in other traditions is only the truth of Christ expressed in other terms, reject all that is really contrary to his Truth."" (p,358-359). But it is interesting how he loves writing about Bob Dylan vinyl records, seeks the company of Zen Buddhists like Thicht Nhat Hanh for meditation, and offers some sympathy for the university radicals. He cozies up to existential literature like Kafka and Camus, rabidly devours the leading thought thinkers of his day.Merton maintains a self-awareness in his journals that makes the book universally fascinating. Sometimes it's the subtle aspects of his wooden home, snow falls, spotting wolves and killing giant bugs that give it a ""Walden"" presence. All of this gives a slowness and visual understanding of his daily world. And there are the more thoughtful centering thoughts about giving space for God, being a vessel who is useful in his writings for a larger American culture, and evocatively writing about the unjust American prescence in Vietnam. And he knew these writings would be found, asking them to not be published until 25 years after his death.Faith asks us to put a stamp on ambiguity. To have confidence in a a set of cards that are not yet revealed. Whether or not we agree with Merton's decisions, and whether or not he finds the inner peace he looks for, it's the searching of the questions themselves that give meaning to the journey."

4926,Three Men in a Boat and Three Men on the Bummel,Jerome K. Jerome,4.09,2691,234,Mmars,4,"If you are feeling nostalgic for the good old days of say, Charlie Chaplin - only British and not American, like pre-Titanic and pre-WWI, when if one were lucky enough to be well off enough not to work and not forced to grow up before the age of say, twenty-five, then this book may fit the bill. It's not something I would have picked up on my own, but for these pages only. I started this as a free Kindle book but felt like I was missing something reading it that way. And was I ever. I picked up the Oxford World's Classic from the library and experienced a 180 degree turn reading experience. There were maps and a glossary, a chronology of Jerome's life, and of course an introduction. Let's hear it for the depth of knowledge! Hip-hip Hooray!Today I read an article in the newspaper about a private school in my metropolis that emptied its library of books, save a few classics and magazines. I cannot tell you how sad that makes me. This private school that upper-middle class and above parents pay for is sending its students to the public library for books. Let's hear it for that school. Boo! Boo! Boo! On the other hand a ""freelibrary"" box has opened an a route I sometimes take. But I digress - which, incidentally, the narrator does much of as he and his friends row a two-oared skiff down the Thames. Leisurely rowing on a slow flowing stream lends itself to that - mind wandering. But not on a river with locks and steam-powered vessels and fast curves! Jolted from thought, hilarous scenes pursue; there are some very good old fashioned slapstick scenarios here. It's also a bit of a travelogue. Information is given on the history of the towns they pass, or on the landscape as it was in then, in 1899. As a read, it was three stars for me. But I've gone with four because a) Jerome was able to maintain the humor from beginning to end and b) this Oxford edition is so well done. It should be since Oxford was their destination. (This review is based on Three Men in a Boat. I did not read Three Men on the Bummel.)"
974,The Da Vinci Code: Fact or Fiction?,Hank Hanegraaff,3.66,147,14,Jon,4,"Discovered this book on my parents' bookshelf and immediately found it intriguing having read Dan Brown's novel years ago. I was not in the slightest convinced of Brown's ""Christianity"" despite its popularity in the media having spawned shows in Discovery and NatGeo in search for the truth of the ""Uncrucified"" and the ""Married Jesus"" all in vain. Numerous cults including that that worship Magdalene even denies Christ was ever married.Actually it was quite appalling for every Christian out there conscious of their history, authenticity of scripture and not only was this a ridiculous assertion of our past it was popularized and considered factual by some who are surprisingly not aware of the historical writings of Josephus, Tacitus and other early historians - none by the way even made the slightest notion of a Married Jesus. Dan Brown's book was a good fiction, a page turner. But to anyone not familiar with Christianity and its history it can lose you with its dangerous new-age sex-induced sensationalism that you might believe anything said to you by the novel's Sir Teabing.If you read Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code. I highly recommend you read Hank Hanegraaff's The Da Vinci Code: Fact or Fiction."

164,The Untouchables,Eliot Ness,3.87,557,31,Rose,5,"I was more entertained than educated by ""The Untouchables"", which is hardly surprising when you consider that Ness was a publicity monger who recognized the value of a good story and enhanced the truth whenever it fell flat. There are phone threats, drive-by shootings, and murders galore, despite the fact that the son of one Untouchable, Barney Cloonan, told Ness biographer Paul Heimel that they were rarely shot at. Although Ness and the Untouchables did not take down the Capone mob as claimed in the popular media, they did damage the famous mobster's bootleg income, inconveniencing him financially. Ness died just before ""The Untouchables"" hit print, making it a haunting as well as intriguing read. It's not an objective look at the dying years of Prohibition and the downfall of Al Capone, but has novelty value as Ness's final words on that exciting period in his career."
165,Untouchables: My Family's Triumphant Journey Out of the Caste System in Modern India,Narendra Jadhav,3.81,306,40,Shankar,5,"This is a true story of how one couple, Damu and Sonu Jadhav dedicated their lives to help their children break free of the shackles of India's caste system. And behind their commitment is the towering inspiration of Babasaheb Ambedkar whose call to educate Dalit children became the motto of their lives. This book goes up along with Mistry's A Fine Balance and Sainath's Everybody Loves a Good Drought in helping me better understand the condition of Dalits in India.  I want to record some of the questions this book inevitably leaves you asking- why has nearly 70 years of 'progressive' democracy not been able to change the system? Education is often called a panacea. But has education been able to truly erase caste lines? I see very well educated people still entrenched in such thinking. Surely, going to school to learn math, english and science is not going to be enough. Also, caste is not going to go away by simply not talking about it. It needs to be tackled head-on. So, what can we do to accelerate change? I believe that a bit of empathy can go a long way. Given this, I find it very heartening to learn about studies that have shown how one can train oneself to become more empathetic. Stereotyping and prejudice against groups are part of the human condition but it is possible to eradicate them by training to see beyond groups and empathize with an individual's struggles, his dreams and aspirations."
159,Dinner with Anna Karenina,Gloria Goldreich,2.98,433,68,Tania,1,"I didn’t read Jane Austen’s Book Club, I only watched the movie. Perhaps I wouldn’t have liked that book either, but that movie inspired me to read this book, which I definitely didn’t like. I found it pretentious and self-serving that the characters were constantly guilt-ridden about their curiosity of their friends’ marriage, became more important that the stories of their lives, that they had to state over and over again how much they loved literature and how because they wanted to discuss it and the authors it put them above the average reader, these were all annoying points.Along with the annoyances – this wasn’t anything special. The characters were your run-of-the-mill “groupies” their storylines were predictable and their decisions were boring. While everyone was mulling over Eric’s possible offense, I called the secret halfway through and I was only skimming. After the first painful 100 pages I took to speed reading – blowing past the mental angst to pick up the meat of the story and get to the end."
161,The Dream Life of Sukhanov,Olga Grushin,3.88,1106,163,Mary,5,"This paranoid, dark, twisted, funny and moving novel enthralled me. Once I got used to it, I loved Grushin’s writing. She has a style that’s hard to describe; descriptive, blunt, and lush. I was hooked pretty quickly by this strange tale and found myself impatient to get back to it whenever I had to put it down. The world of Sukhanov was highly addictive. You never really knew what was going to happen next as this Soviet official wandered around 1980s Moscow in a fog, dipping in and out of reality, and creating some very amusing scenes with those around him. The past is always lurking right there ready to claim us. One minute Sukhanov is living his cushy life, the next he’s entire being is overcome by the force of nostalgia and regret. The narrative switches up without warning from third person to first person and it works magnificently.Is Sukhanov an unreliable narrator? Looking back, I’d say yes. But aren’t we all? How clouded by hindsight and remorse are we? When everything is filtered through the lens of the present, it’s easy to see what we should’ve done; easier still to justify what we did do. Nothing is isolated. Everything we do sends ripples that touch those around us and alter the future. Life is nothing but forks in the road. Sukhanov went one way, his friend went the other. Who was wiser? We are our choices, Sartre said. Indeed. I’d go one step further and say we are also our consequences. We have to live with what we’ve done and that never goes away, no matter how deeply you bury it. There were parts in this novel that made my chest tighten. The hold memories have on us is something so powerful and absolute. Sukhanov’s mental break was beautiful, claustrophobic and hopeless. This book is a gem. "
163,The Untouchable,John Banville,3.96,2194,239,Katie,5,"It took a while for the magic of this to work on me. Initially I thought Banville’s prose had the quality of bracken on a forest floor – the light picks out some beautiful tones and textures but there was a pervading sense of brittle lifelessness. I felt he wrote like someone who never leaves his study - or perhaps never leaves his head. But, then, all of a sudden, just before world war two arrives, it jumped into life and I very much doubt if I’ll read a more beautifully written novel this year. It’s not going to be everyone’s cup of tea. The narrator is just about as world weary and cynical as any voice in literature I’ve come across. The mood is very much autumnal. Banville has created a fictitious Anthony Blunt, one of the Cambridge spies, and told his story in the form of a memoir – what used to be called a roman-a-clef but now seems to be known as biographical fiction. I guess the first question one asks is why bother giving Blunt a fictitious name? It gives Banville licence to make things up – which means you end up more curious about Blunt than feeling secure he’s been explained to you. This was a little about annoying, as if I now have to read another book about him! At the same time Banville’s character is one of the most memorable and thought provoking I’ve encountered for ages. He's given us a brilliantly complex portrait of a man who defines many characteristics and contradictions of the age in which he lived. The most fascinating thing about Banville’s Blunt is that there’s nothing passionate about his politics. He doesn’t at any point come across as a man driven by ideology. It’s more like being a spy for the communists is a thrilling dangerous game for him. And that the subterfuge fulfils a deep need of his nature. Blunt was also homosexual and the two “occupations” have many parallels – the need of a bogus convincing façade, the necessity of whispering, of being vigilant to your surroundings, of gravitating towards dark secret places, of carrying around the tension of imminent catastrophic betrayal at every moment. At the heart of this novel is a painting Blunt buys and loves as a young man. It’s believed to be a Poussin but has never been authenticated. The authenticity or not of this painting becomes more and more related to the authenticity of Blunt himself as the novel progresses – is there any connection between his inner and outer life? Does he even have an inner life? At times it seems not. He takes no interest in his children (I don’t think Anthony Blunt had a wife or children in real life); he is driven by lust not love; he is a snob; he notices surfaces, especially weather, but seems to have little empathy for people. His only true passion is for art, and particularly Poussin, who he writes about and becomes an expert on. So you have the sense that the only thing holding Blunt together is the hope that his painting is authentic. It’s an exciting moment in the novel when we find out if it’s authentic or not. "
162,Untouchable,Mulk Raj Anand,3.67,2837,236,Samadrita,3,"It amuses me to no end how there has been no perceivable ebb in the flow of Holocaust-World War II novels and yet every time a Toni Morrison and an Alice Walker and a Richard Wright and a Ralph Ellison have tried to address the elephant in the room or America's endemic race problem which like a many-headed monster continues to rampage on unvanquished, they have been accused of betraying an overt political mindedness and a violation of that much harped upon maxim of 'art for art's sake.'""Oh Toni Morrison won the Nobel because she wrote about slavery you know!""Before you scoff at the above declamation let me mention that I have quoted that statement verbatim. 6 million Jews, 7 years. Unaccounted for anonymous millions, 4 centuries. But alas like every other literary theme on the planet, brutalization of human beings, too, has its color-coded hierarchical positions within the canon. The sweeper is worse off than a slave, for the slave may change his master and his duties and may even become free, but the sweeper is bound forever, born into a state from which he cannot escape and where he is excluded from social intercourse and the consolations of his religion.So slavery. A word which no longer evokes the kind of knee-jerk instinctual horror or pathos that it should and has descended into the realms of banality through repeated use over the years. And yet the word refuses to become just another obsolete dictionary entry with its persistent reappearances before us in myriad new grotesque avatars. Forced prostitution, human trafficking, slavery of illegal immigrant workers, bonded labor and so on and so forth. Our own home-made brand of slavery-segregation went by the label of 'untouchability', another convenient, religion-sanctioned writ flagrantly upheld by authorities. Quote obscure mumbo jumbo from scriptures, invent excuses to justify your irrational bias and manipulate the system into giving 'religion' free reign and tada your status quo has been manufactured. 
  He realised he couldn't rush even though the Mahatma had abolished all caste distinctions for the day. He might touch someone and then there would be a scene. The Mahatma would be too far away to come and help him.
One can call this work a thinly disguised attempt at political pamphleteering because there is very little literary merit to be found here. No linguistic shenanigans to express apoplectic joy over. No dazzling imagery to wax eloquent about. A book named 'Untouchable' on an untouchable latrine-cleaner can boast of no thematic subtlety either. To add to these causes of botheration, Anand devotes a portion to the exaltation of Gandhi who had initially felt the necessity of vindicating the caste system (probably to forestall criticism of Hinduism) despite championing the cause of the harijan ('untouchable'). If you have read enough Arundhati Roy or are aware of her political views, you probably know what I am talking about. So yes this novel is a product of a time and the awakening collective consciousness of an emerging nation-state. It is unable to reconcile an essentially hostile social milieu to the aspirations of an enlightened new generation and merely musters up a robust optimism for the foreseeable future. But it added to a much needed discourse at a time when it was in short supply. So there. Of course, caste-based violence is still a regularly resurfacing news item and stigmatization of crematorium/graveyard workers, garbage-collectors and assorted dregs of society has not been completely obliterated. But the normalization of the relentless verbal and physical abuse that Bakha, our 'untouchable' protagonist, is subjected to in the book has long been discontinued. Unable to love it whole-heartedly as I was, I am still painfully aware of this book's relevance. May we be forgiven for passive participation in the ritual dehumanization of a section of society but may we never forget."
8664,The Sherlock Holmes Mysteries,Arthur Conan Doyle,4.28,714,39,rachel,4,"One of the two head-'n'-shoulders-above best classes EVER that I took in college was Crime Scene Investigation. I used to feel a little thrill in my chest whenever my instructor would break from theory and lead into an example from his own detective days with an ominous ""We found a body..."". He would sometimes lay out the clues found at the site and the suspects for us, and then leave us to parse out our own conclusions, based on what we knew of physical evidence and criminal psychology. These moments were easily my favorite part of the week, my favorite part of the semester, maybe my favorite part of college at all.So, of course, I really enjoyed the Holmes mysteries. The emphasis in each case is on the detective explaining his reasoning; like Holmes, there are few things I like more than working through a good logical puzzle (that sounds super pretentious but there's really no other way to say it) especially when it means that closure will be had. For about 7 or 8 of these cases, I figured out the solution and motivation before Holmes' explanation. I'm not sure if this can be attributed to education or to how ubiquitous elements of these stories have become in TV and film, but it is likely at least as much the latter as the former. The stories towards the end got noticeably weaker or less intriguing, with the exception of The Priory School. And the actual printing of the collection was pretty bad, as once in a while Holmes or Watson will reference a previous case that is included in the collection but that I had yet to read, so the comparison was lost. But for the most part, I liked this and the opportunity it gave me to remember how I considered dropping my English degree senior year to begin all over again and study Criminal Justice. Two years graduated and sometimes I still regret this."
8665,Treasure Island,Robert Louis Stevenson,3.82,315294,8081,Bookdragon Sean ,3,"Someone recently asked me what review I enjoyed writing the most, and, well, this is it:I have a massive problem with this book. It’s one I’m a little embarrassed to admit. The problem is not with the writing or the characters that Stevenson has created; it’s not even with the plot. The problem resides with Kermit the Frog. (Stay with me here!) I grew up watching the muppets. I became slightly obsessed with them. I kind of wanted to join them. So, whenever I read about Captain Smollett and Long John Silver all I can see is Kermit fighting Tim Curry! Therefore, I just can’t take this book seriously. Well, at least not completely. The Muppet Treasure Island is such a great film; it’s hilarious. This book was much more serious. The pirates in here aren’t singing toys; they’re hardened criminals that created the pirate stereotype. They’re the sort of men you don’t want on your ship because they’d likely cut your throat in your sleep. They might wake you up first if they’re feeling kind. So, they wouldn’t try and gain your trust by singing you a jolly song about piracy, like Tim and his muppet mates would. But, muppet based comparison aside, this is a good novel. I did quite enjoy it. It all begins when the young Jim Hawkins comes across a map for buried treasure, except he hasn’t got any money to fund the voyage. He  Gonzo and Rizzo goes alone and seeks the help of  Fozzie Bear  Squire Trelawney. As a member of the Victorian gentry, he takes the map for himself with the intention of filling his own coffers with the loot. He’s not a very nice  bear  guy, and he’s not overly intelligent either. In his frugality he accidently hires a group of twisted  muppets  pirates that, unsurprisingly, mutiny against him. This all sounds terrible, I know. But, it’s not all bad because the ship’s captain is none other than  Kermit the Frog  Captain Smollett who is absolutely in love with  Miss Piggy  no one. Indeed, Smollett is in direct contrast to the money driven  Fozzie  Trelawney because he is everything he is not; he is brave and honourable; he is completely true to his word. He is competing, unknowingly, for the attention of Jim. The young boy is looking for a farther figure, and in Silver and Smollett he sees two potential role models, and two potential life choices. It all works out in the end though because this is a  muppet movie adventure book after all. In all seriousness, it is an exciting book. But, for me, that’s all it is. There are no hidden motives or dark secrets. Everything is straight forward, clean cut and simple. It is a nice easy read. Stevenson’s masterpiece is most definitely  The Strange Case of Doctor Jekyll and Mr Hyde. That’s where the real mystery is at. But, it doesn’t have muppets….."
6996,No Ordinary Genius: The Illustrated Richard Feynman,Christopher Sykes,4.31,1858,22,Lana Rigsby,5,"Just when I thought I'd read most everything this guy ever wrote, a friend gave me No Ordinary Genius: The Illustrated Richard Feynman. Wonderful! I felt I was meeting someone that up till now I'd only known through letters—all the photos and drawings and little notes give me a clearer, more intimate picture of this iconoclastic scientist whose words I've loved for years. The robe and bunny slippers picture adds significantly to my up-to-now skimpy mental picture. This book is full of telling anecdotes, many of which are also new to me. Freeman Dyson tells that once, in Austin Texas, Feynman was so appalled at the garishly opulent hotel he'd been placed in that he simply announced ""Not sleeping here, good-bye"", and walked out into the woods to sleep under the stars. This from a man in his mid-sixties who was dying of cancer. Danny Hillis talks about being startled into confessing his sadness at the realization that Feynman was dying. After a moment, the great scientist answered, ""Yeah, that bugs me too, sometimes."" The king is dead; long live the king."
6994,"Dumbing Down Our Kids: Why American Children Feel Good About Themselves But Can't Read, Write or Add",Charles J. Sykes,3.66,167,31,Skylar Burris,3,"Dumbing Down Our Kids is an expansive (but not chronologically organized) history of educational fads and failed reforms from the 1920’s through the mid-1990’s, complete with numerous spine-chilling anecdotes of outlandish teachers, classes, and curricula. Sykes doesn’t quite put it like this, but his book shows that U.S. education is largely a story of traditional, fairly successful, basics-focused education giving way to the trendy, “progressive” ideas born of the educational theorists in the academically mediocre Education Departments of the nation’s universities, resulting in students’ decreased ability to read, write, and compute, until the disaster becomes obvious enough that there is a return to basics, only to give way again a few years later to the same inane trends under different names, in a never-ending loop of “back-to-basic” and “progressive” approaches in which any educational gains are wiped out every few years. What kind of public school education you receive depends largely on where you happen to hit this cycle when you enter your local school. One would think this book was out of date, having been published in 1995, but the point is that educational fads have a way of circling back again. It was written not long after I graduated from high school, so I recognized some of the educational ideologies from my own experience, “cooperative learning” being the major one. I only very nearly escaped the “open classroom” fad; it was going on in the elementary school for which I was zoned, but as my mother was a public school teacher, at the time she was permitted to send me to another public school of her choice, one that was fortunately not expecting children to learn from osmosis in a chaotic environment. Other educational ideologies detailed in this book I did not experience myself, but I recognize them from my daughter’s first year in public school – the most notable being “whole language” (also known as “creative spelling” or “language experience”), the excessive promotion of groundless “self-esteem,” and the “mainstreaming” of children who would better benefit (and less distract other students) in separate classes. Nearly all of the teaching methodologies and ideologies the author denounces I believe to be, based on my own experience or that of my daughter, entirely worthy of harsh criticism. And because of this, I give the book three stars. It does not receive five stars, however, because, like most educational books of its kind, it relies far too heavily on anecdotal evidence, often presenting the extreme case as the normative case. I can pull out a handful of horrifying anecdotes from my own years of public schooling (an English teacher who did not know the difference between an adjective from an adverb and taught us incorrectly; a math teacher who regularly showed up late for class, taught us very little math, and allowed us to earn A’s and B’s with extra credit assignments that involved, among other things, making paper airplanes; a P.E. teacher who brought his students to tears), but these stand out as exceptions for me in a sea of otherwise good teachers. While I certainly felt that “cooperative learning” was a royal waste of time, with a 6.5 hour school day, one manages to learn enough real information despite all that, provided cooperative learning is not ALL the teacher is doing. I can read, write, and add, thank you very much. The problem with these books is that there is no way to tell if these outrageous tendencies are indicative of even an entire school, let alone an entire town, an entire state, or an entire country. While such inadequate methods should be decried and replaced, I think it goes a bit far to say our children can’t “read, write, or add.” I would also like to know more about these international comparison in which the U.S. figures so horribly. What are these “international tests”? Who writes them? Who administers them? Who takes them? I don’t ever recall being given one myself. And how does one compare reading and writing ability in international tests, anyway – when one considers that French and Spanish and Korean, say, are rather different languages than English. I never feel like I get an explanation of this in any educational book, and I certainly did not in this one. At least this book confronted one of my objections to such comparisons. I have always thought that, given the compulsory nature of our education system, it wasn’t really fair to compare us to a place like Korea, where education is a privilege and not a legal mandate, and where the slow and disobedient eventually get kicked out of school. Sykes does address this, noting that all of these other nations DO have compulsory schooling through elementary level, though it does become selective in junior high and high school, but the U.S. still falls behind on elementary school test comparisons – so that excuse for American failure is inadequate. In addition to failed educational methods, Sykes addresses sex education curriculum; sex-abuse prevention curriculum (here I disagreed with him most, as I find this curriculum fairly reasonable and helpful); and the excessive use of (and overly subjective criteria for) the “learning disabled” label (another point I can agree with based on my own personal experience of narrowly escaping such a label despite being a satisfactory student at the time and an exceptional student years later). And what are his suggestions for improving the U.S. education system? He notes that there are successful schools throughout the country, some private, some public, some in affluent suburbs, some in inner cities – but research shows they all consistently have three major things in common (notably, you will NOT find among them either funding or class-size): (1) Emphasis on “pupil mastery of low level skills” and consistent “attention to the progress of all students in…reading, writing, and computation,” (2) high expectations and a willingness to fail students who do not meet standards, and (3) constant monitoring and evaluation of student progress. How to get more schools to share these successful characteristics? Unfortunately, he argues, it won’t be easy because of a deeply entrenched, bureaucratic, union-protected, monopoly public school system. (And not much has changed since he wrote this book over ten years ago, except that the federal government now has even more control over education than it did then.) We have to get rid of this idea that support for “public education” necessarily means support for the public school SYSTEM and seek public financing of education without necessarily demanding public production. But if we’re ever to get anywhere near a solution to our educational woes, Sykes suggest, we’ll first need to eliminate the federal Department of Education and all 50 state departments and open up entry to the teaching profession to non-“educationists” by abolishing current teacher certification requirements. I happen to agree, but … yeah … good luck with that. All in all, it’s a decent book, providing a lot of information, and giving the reader an understanding of what educational theories (such as “outcome based education”) truly mean in practice. It could be better organized; there could be less redundancy, and the anecdotes could be put in a broader statistical context rather than left to imply a normative, universal state. (There are plenty of statics regarding test scores and funding and such, but not a great many regarding, say, percentage of schools or teachers using phonics vs. whole language). Like many books on education, I think he expects too much of teachers and ignores student limitations. For a rare book that takes these (and other) limitations into account, read Charles Murray’s Real Education instead. "

6999,Society of Captives: A Study of a Maximum Security Prison,Gresham M. Sykes,3.72,71,7,Cat,3,"No reviews for this book? Hard to believe given the number of used copies available. Surely many have read ""Society of Captives""?Sykes uses the sociological framework of Talcott Parsons to analyze the ""life of prison"" in terms of its effects on the inmates. Sykes was obviously a key reference point for Goffman's work in ""Asylums"". Sykes works around the idea of describing a maximum security prison as a ""total institution"", but fails to really nail the concept down.He makes some interesting observations about the conflicting motives of guards on the front line of the prison. I found troubling his conclusion that the level of control sought to be imposed upon the prisoners was ever elusive. This seemed, to me, to be a justification for the behavior that goes on behind prison walls.His interesting discussion of prison riot and rebellion prefigures some of Foucault's analysis in ""Discipline and Punish"". In fact, I picked up my copy of Discipline and Punish immediately after (and during) reading this book and found the effect to be akin to a light bulb going on in my head.While Sykes lacks the conclusions of Foucault, his simplified analysis of the structure of prison makes reading Foucault's ""Discipline and Punish"" about 100% easier.Here is not the place for a more detailed comparison between the two books. None the less, any committed reader of Discipline and Punish should feel compelled to digest this book: After all, it only costs a buck and can be read in a single afternoon!"
2985,On the Beaten Path: An Appalachian Pilgrimage,Robert Alden Rubin,3.77,420,56,Gail Gray,5,"I finished On the Beaten Path recently and have to say it's one of the most lyrical books on the AT experience I've ever read. I love Rubin's writing, as I should, since he was an editor before hitting the trail and made the journey after becoming disillusioned with his job, along with the difficulties editors face, which I know first hand. Slogging through lots of stories to find the gems and then once you do so, the pain of writing rejection letters, and even having to reject good writing simply because there's no room. Rubin's descriptions are poetic and vibrant, his approaches change as he is transformed by the trip and the spiritual nature, not in any heavy handed way, more the way one feels when they stand at a summit in awe of the vision stretched out before, above and below them. He can translate this into words and therefore into our minds and hearts. This is a book I'll read over and over. It is an end-to- end, shelter by shelter NOBO relating of the trek, which at this point in educating myself about the trail, I enjoy. It makes it easier for me to look up sections as Loner goes through each particular area so I can imagine what he's seeing.The human story is just as vivid as the nature and travel experience. Rubin honestly accounts the confusion and unsettled discomfort he feels and which drives him to the trail, despite the fact it is a hardship on his wife. We are allowed to come to an understanding, as he does, of how each hiker is transformed by the experience and via a ripple effect so are those in their lives. This remarkable weaving of many perspectives of the Trail helps us understands why some people ""need"" to make this journey. Some may see it as an escapist act, but in the larger vision, it is not a running away from the world but a running towards the true north authentic self.I agree with Bryson in looking at the attempted thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail as a sort of pilgrimage, something each culture needs as a sort of initiation, a coming to terms of what's important and how one must be transformed, an act which minds like Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell considered imperative to the growth of each person.While not as irreverent as Bill Bryson's ""A Walk in the Woods"", Rubin's book still has its funny bits, and while not as detailed as David Miller's book AWOL on the Appalachian Trail, with it's organized info, I found On the Beaten Path less dry for a non hiker who is looking more for a story than for a tool to use to plan a hike.So far, I think Rubin's book is my favorite on the Appalachian Trail, a profound story on both an inner and outer level, of what he calls a pilgrimage. Rubin masterfully blends the powerful encounters of human nature and Mother Nature into a vivid portrayal of this monumental task."
2986,In An Uncertain World: Tough Choices From Wall Street To Washington,Robert E. Rubin,3.71,415,29,Andrea James,1,"I appear to have quite a different opinion of this book to most of the other reviewers on Goodreads. As much as Robert Rubin may have accomplished both in the private and public sector, he is simply not good at writing or storytelling or indeed at providing insights into how he solves problems and makes decisions, the emotional and intellectual conflicts one faces or any astute observations of what other people might be going through.The book reads like ""I applied to Harvard and then I went there and then I met president Clinton, and he was nice and smart, and then I met my amazing wife and she told me that...and so I..."". Much in the style of a speech a 6-year-old might give when under pressure to give a summary of their life (except that Rubin has met high powered people and worked in influential positions).On the other hand, I thought that the descriptions of economic scenarios were actually plainly written and not hard to follow at all. Boring, like the rest of the book, but easy to follow.It could have been so much more had he just given a glimpse into thought processes, the political manoeuvring, any personal interests and jostling that may have impacted decisions, irrationalities in assessing situations...anything really that might show the greater depth of analysis that he is very likely to be capable of."
2989,Behind a Mask: The Unknown Thrillers of Louisa May Alcott,Louisa May Alcott,3.76,977,106,Ana Rînceanu,3,"""Behind a Mask"" - (4 stars)""Pauline's Passion and Punishment"" - Pauline's revenge against a false lover (4 stars)""The Mysterious Key"" - a young widow and her daughter hire a mysterious young man; the mystery aspect of the story is great, but the characters lack charm which is sad for Alcott characters. (2 stars)""The Abbot's Ghost"" - Maurice is left crippled after an accident and lives with his cousin Jasper; he tries to win the hand of his love, Octavia, despite a great secret; good story but predictable (2 stars)"
2987,Hospital Sketches,Louisa May Alcott,3.62,1448,120,Teresa,4,"I read this concurrently with Becoming Dickens: The Invention of a Novelist -- unintentionally, but appropriately -- as not only was Dickens one of Alcott's favorite writers, but this fictionalized memoir of Alcott’s could be said to have led to her “becoming Louisa May Alcott”.Similar to the start of the Dickens phenomenon with The Pickwick Papers being published under the name of “Boz”, Alcott gained her first bout of fame with this work, writing under the pseudonym of ""Tribulation Periwinkle"" (one sees the Dickens influence immediately). Her short time as a Civil War nurse in a Union hospital is expressed in humorous, sensitive, ironic and impassioned prose. Like her literary hero, she captures the telling details. Nurse Trib P., reflecting on her life-changing experiences ministering to the wounded and dying under adverse conditions, discovers a philosophy of life, and her own writing style. In much the same way the sketches of The Pickwick Papers led to Dickens’ development of Oliver Twist, Alcott's hospital sketches paved her way toward Little Women.All of which has me wondering, again, if I would’ve become the Dickens fan I am without my childhood reading of Alcott.""I'd rather laugh than cry, when I must sing out anyhow, so just say that bit from Dickens again, please, and I'll stand it like a man."" He did; for ""Mrs. Cluppins,"" ""Chadband,"" and ""Sam Weller,"" always helped him through; thereby causing me to lay another offering of love and admiration on the shrine of the god of my idolatry, though he does wear too much jewelry and talk slang."
2991,Louisa May Alcott: A Biography: With an Introduction to the New Edition,Madeleine B. Stern,3.85,143,10,Andrea Hickman Walker,4,"Louisa May Alcott really was an amazing woman. I knew her only from the four books about the March family (given that a fair majority of South African books are obtained from British publishers/printers we have Good Wives, rather than two parts of Little Women). I knew that she'd written some other books, but I'd never read any and hadn't much interest in them. I had some vague knowledge that she'd been a nurse in the civil war and that Little Women was semi-autobiographical. I wanted to go to Orchard House because it was mentioned in the adaptation I have of Little Women (the Winona Ryder version).So, when my partner and I were in Boston, we hopped up to Concord (Massachusetts, not the one in New Hampshire or whatever it is further to the north) and visited Orchard House. There I learnt more about her writing, the importance of her father and the society in which they lived. I was more than ready to read her biography - this apparently being one of the best biographies of Louisa May Alcott ever written. It is well written without appearing at all like a biography in any way. It's written more like a historical novel, though one knows that all the events and facts that are dramatised on the page are actual events written about in the family journal and letters.This is a highly recommended read."
2990,Rose in Bloom,Louisa May Alcott,4.03,18408,436,Rachel,5,"For many years (until I read Jane Eyre the second time), this was my absolute favorite book. It is perhaps the reason I love 'nerds.' While many women grew up loving Mr. Darcy, I grew up loving Mac. He was my ideal love interest. He suffered long and noblely for love of Rose and I admired that with all of my little heart. I dreamed of being Rose. Of course, I would have accepted him at once instead of stringing him along so. ;) Regardless, after over fifteen readings (wearing out my old copy so that I had to by a new one) I still find myself liking the lovable Mac, laughing uproariously at him learning to dance. This is a delightful book and well worth the read, even if you don't fall in love with Mac. ;)"
3447,In the Lake of the Woods,Tim O'Brien,3.78,13825,1172,Mary,5,"Looks real black and white now – very clear – but back then everything came at you in bright colors. No sharp edges. Lots of glare. A nightmare like that, all you want is to forget. None of it ever seemed real in the first place.In The Lake of the Woods holds a special place in my memory. I first read it about sixteen years ago in a stifling un-air-conditioned and over-crowded classroom, and with all my 90s angst I was prime for it to get under my skin. It was the first time that I realized there were books out there that weren’t just about what they were about. After Lake, I sought out different books and expected more of them. Looking back at my age, gender, and disposition, perhaps it should’ve been Esther Greenwood who first spoke to me - that certainly would’ve been a more comforting stereotype. As it were, for better or for worse, it was John Wade.At the funeral he wanted to kill everybody who was crying and everybody who wasn’t. He wanted to take a hammer and crawl into the casket and kill his father for dying…..At school when the teachers told him how sorry they were that he’d lost his father, he understood that lost was just another way of saying dead. But still the idea kept turning in his mind. He’d picture his father stumbling down a dark alley, lost, not dead at all…..He'd bend down and pick up his father and put him in his pocket and be careful never to lose him again.This imagery early in the book sprung out at me when I first read it. The class erupted into snickers, and I giggled along with them. But later, I was left with the vivid picture of an awkward, hurting boy, rustling through blades of grass and scooping up his tiny father. John Wade’s desperate seeking stopped being an amusing image and started to become sad and lonely. After that, all the books I read had to be a little sad and lonely. What O’Brien has created with Lake is a blurry, unfocused story to mimic the blurry, unfocused nature of things – childhood, marriage, war, life. The narrative skitters around dreamily; everything is given in snippets and suggestions. Everything in John Wade’s life seems as though it’s been filtered through a funhouse mirror. Everything is a distortion. His father was an abusive alcoholic who appeared to everyone else to be a wonderful guy. His mother (like his wife Kathy later on) survives through denial and justification. John performs magic tricks throughout his childhood, controlling and performing. He goes to Vietnam where the events are covered up, half-real, and like everything else, a contorted magic trick for the viewing public. The war, like his father, like his childhood and pretty much everything, is arranged to appear to the world to be something different. After the war, John goes into politics where yet again everything is choreographed to alter reality. Everything is an illusion. Everything we think we know is really just a product of the information we’re given. From our parents, to world events, to this stranger sleeping beside us year after year. How much of what we know to be true actually is true? John Wade spends his life manipulating and covering up. Look around you - he’s not the only one.Our own children, our fathers, our wives and husbands: Do we truly know them? How much is camouflage? How much is guessed at? How many lies get told, and when, and about what? How often do we say, or think, God, I never knew her? How often do we lie awake speculating – seeking some hidden truth? Oh, yes, it gnaws at me…Denial is a powerful tool that can sustain people for decades. John’s denial, Kathy’s, everybody’s. We tell ourselves it will get better, just hold on, things will work out. What would our lives be like now if we had made just one different decision? How much did we really mean to that one person who will never find the courage to tell us? How much different would things be if we had just spoken up, taken a different job, moved to a different place and reinvented ourselves? If our parents were just a little less tortured, a little more stable? If some men in suits had never signed away our life and innocence? This is not a mystery novel. We’re not supposed to figure out what happened to Kathy, if in fact anything happened to her at all. This is a book of questions, not answers. And the questions you should be asking when you’re done reading is not “did he kill her?” That’s just the magic trick. At the minimum, you should be asking why we send the mentally ill to war. Why we’re so quick to condemn what we don’t fully comprehend. How reliable are our memories. And, will we ever be free of our demons?Mystery finally claims us."
5332,Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol,Jane Parker Resnick,3.89,46,2,Mekenna Price,4,"This is a great classic story. I really do like this edition; however, if you were reading to younger children, I think that it would bore them. It is rather long and for them, there wouldn't be many pictures in it. While the illustrations were pretty, they were also placed at weird times. For example, when they introduced the Ghost of Christmas Present, they had the picture of Scrooge and him on one page, but he was introduced on the next page. All in all, I would have older children read this story, say, around age 11 or 12. If I wanted younger children to hear and see the story, I would probably go looking for another version of it."
6764,"Easy French Reader, Second Edition",R. de Roussy de Sales,3.81,267,32,David Grimaud,3,"This book is best used as a supplement to a beginning French language instruction program or course. It is in three sections, each section containing several chapters, and each section more challenging than the prior section. The first section is a running dialogue, a play, between two young friends, an American girl and French boy, as they tour their French locale and develop their relationship. The second section is a history of French leaders from Vercingétorix through Jacque Chirac. The third section contains abridged short stories by deceased, famous authors of French literature, ending in dramatic fashion with a story by Guy de Maupassant.I had two years of French in High School and am taking the Rosetta Stone computer course in French. Considering I have no one with which to share my French skills, this book has been effective in improving my French reading skills. It anticipates improvement in grammar, beginning with only the present tense, and by the end of the book using additional tenses. Most of the French words (or their roots) are listed in a French-English dictionary (""Vocabulary"") in the back of the book, so there is little need to consult another dictionary. A great feature is that the author translated many new French words in the margins, removing much inconvenience in referring to the ""Vocabulary."" To challenge the reader, the author finishes each chapter with a quiz or test in French, with answers given in the back of the book. There are also several subsections and tests to refresh and review the reader as he works through the book.In conclusion, I was very happy with this book. Given that I have no outlet to test my French, This book helped me improve my French reading skills, giving me positive feedback as I read through it."

As a life long student of the language, I have always been able to speak semi-decent ""Spanglish."" With well over 770 easy and memorable phrases, this book helped me piece together so key phrases during my trip that allowed me to communicate effectively. This book is broken down into many subsections from ""breakfast foods"" to other categories like ""at the restaurant."" But throughout this phrase book a consistent theme was very prevalent: ""Learn these 770 words/phrases and you will be able to get by with communicating in a Spanish speaking environment!""If you are interested in a much deeper study of the Spanish language, this isn't the book for you. But if you are interested in learning a quick list of phrases and words that will help you communicate, THIS IS YOUR BOOK!"
5335,A Christmas Carol,Charles Dickens,4.02,447275,11627,Bookdragon Sean ,4,"I read this every year at Christmas, and I always will do. Simply because of the atmosphere it evokes. This story is Christmas as far as I’m concerned. It wouldn’t be the same without it. It is perfectly festive and is also appropriately didactic. It is an allegory for what happens to those that are unnecessarily bitter and twisted, refusing to take part in a joyful occasion. It is a glimpse at what could happen to someone who rejects their family upon trivial grounds, and let’s themselves be set apart. It is also a suggestion that one shouldn’t be so concerned with money. Money isn’t everything; it certainly didn’t buy ol’ Scrooge happiness. But, Christmas did and will do so again. "
6760,Perspective Made Easy,Ernest R. Norling,4.18,820,29,Jim,4,"If you had told me I'd read a 200+ page book on perspective drawing, I would have told you you've been drinking too much, but Norling's book was actually entertaining while covering what can be a very dry topic for artists and art students.Originally published in 1939, this Dover Book reprint has faithfully reproduced the original illustrations and the text is clear and easy to read. As a technique book, Norling covers each topic in simple steps with clear illustrations of each idea. If you're a beginner, this book will be very helpful, especially if you don't have a teacher and are trying to learn on your own.I picked up this book to help me prepare lesson plans for next fall, and I was pleasantly surprised at the range of topics Norling covers, some of which I'd never considered before, and some which I haven't thought of since I was an art student back in the dark ages. Overall, a pleasant surprise and a useful resource for artists, teachers, and students."
6762,The Easy Way to Stop Drinking,Allen Carr,4.01,119,12,Emily,4,"A lot more compelling than I expected. It was obvious from the start that I wasn't the target audience, so I can't say how well the method works for someone trying to quit alcohol (at times I didn't feel like I would have been convinced), but the Amazon testimonials had me intrigued. Carr's writing style is very didactic, but his method is straightforward and he seems to me to take a much more reasonable approach to addiction and substance abuse than most. Though I don't know much about AA, it has completely changed the lives of some of my friends, so I don't want to belittle that. But I loved that Carr's method is empowering and gives the choice back to the individual. Like the title implies, he doesn't make it any harder than it has to be.Carr may seem patronizing and dismissive at first glance, but he's personally experienced years of alcohol and nicotine addiction, and helped countless others to overcome it. He's not naive in his perspective. This book has made me rethink the way I view both addictive and social behaviors and even some of my own habits."
4213,"Der Vorleser - Inhalt, Hintergrund, Interpretation",Dietmar Schäfer,3.27,15,2,Anja,4,"Ein klug erzähltes Buch, welches sich wunderbar flüssig und in kurzen Sätzen liest. Mit anderen Worten, das Buch erreicht nicht eine bestimmte Zielgruppe, sondern jeden. Michael lernt 1950 Hanna kennen und ist sofort von ihr fasziniert. Daraus entwickelt sich schnell Leidenschaft und seine erste Liebe, obwohl sie rätselhaft ist und ein Geheimnis zu hüten scheint. Vor jedem Liebesakt muss er ihr vorlesen. Irgendwann verschwindet sie einfach und Michael, leidet zwar, fängt dann aber an Jura zu studieren und lebt sein Leben weiter, bis er sie später plötzlich auf der Anklagebank wiedertrifft, denn Hanna ist eine von fünf angeklagten ehemaligen Aufseherinnen der Nazizeit die in den KZ’s in Auschwitz und Krakau tätig waren, und ihrem Geheimnis auf die Spur kommt.Hanna muss ins Gefängnis und Michael liest wieder für sie, diesmal allerdings auf Kassetten, welche er ihr regelmässig ins Gefängnis schickt.Ich fand das Buch sehr ergreifend und mit waren beide Protagonisten auf ihre Art sympatisch. Im Prinzip geht es im ganzen Buch um Schuld, Scham und Gewissen und darum wie Michael aber auch Hanna ihr Leben verstreichen lassen. Hanna bittet nicht um mildernde Umstände und lässt alles mit sich geschehen. Es gibt immer wieder philosophisches, das zum Nachdenken anregt. Auch der Politische Hintergrund wird gut dargestellt, denn man erlebt in diesem Buch nicht nur die Sicht eines NS-Opfers, sondern auch die Sicht eines Täters. Ein wirklich empfehlenswertes Buch ohne Happy End."
9639,Essays (Everyman's Library Classics),George Orwell,4.47,613,50,Paul Bryant,5,"Update - this just like Forrest Gump's box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to get next. As the dark war-torn year of 1940 begins, what does Orwell begin the year with? Why, a 50 page dissection of the work of Charles Dickens... and expressed with such breathtaking authority too :in spite of his generosity of mind, he is not free from the special prejudices of the shabby-genteel. It is usual to claim him as a ""popular"" writer, a champion of the ""oppressed masses""... but there are two things that condition his attitude. In the first place, he is a south-of-England man, a Cockney at that, and therefore out of touch with the bulk of the real oppressed masses, the industrial and agricultural labourers. It is interesting to see how Chesterton, another Cockney, always presents Dickens as a spokesman of ""the poor"", without showing much awareness of who ""the poor"" really are. To Chesterton, ""the poor"" means small shopkeepers and servants. ... The other point is that Dickens's early experiences have given him a horror of proletarian roughness...**********************I never read Orwell! Ok, Animal Farm back in school. That’s all. And he must be one of the most banged-on-about authors in the history of the written word. So it really became incumbent upon one to give him a go. I wasn’t looking forward that much. Wasn’t he just going to be spouting the received centre-left opinion of his day and waxing on about Spain and The Beano and Greta Garbo and the lost ha’penny sherbet dib-dabs of 1938?Anyway I browbeat myself into giving him a go so I got this big beast, the almost complete non-fiction. 1369 pages. The complete edition includes all known laundry and shopping lists.Well, I was wrong. Now I get it. And now I’m a fan. He’s so easy to read, and so interesting. He becomes your very slightly know-it-all friend. It will take me a couple of years to chew through this substantial volume but it’s so full of stuff right from the first page that I thought it deserved to be reviewed section by section, starting with the first which is catchily named “1928-37”.*The first of several surprising ideas was in essay number one – that in 1928 there were such things as almost-free newspapers. They cost a farthing then, which was a quarter of a penny. The loss they incurred was made up entirely by advertising. So, the same economic model as the online versions of every newspaper now (except those behind a paywall). And of course there are many actual free actual newspapers around. Well, I thought this was a recent-ish phenomenon, just a little bit older than the internet itself. How wrong I was.Number two – holy crap! In an essay called “Clink” (August 1932) he’s using the f AND the c words to demonstrate the kind of language used by the common criminals of England. Was this essay ever published? Surely not. But it’s a good one… so I’m confused.Number three – “Bookshop Memories” – ha, remember that popular thing  Weird Things Customers Say in Bookshops? This is the 1936 version. People were saying pretty much the same things then. In those days some bookshops also ran lending libraries, and here Orwell turns his spotlight on another interesting question :In a lending library you see people’s real tastes, not their pretended ones, and the one thing that strikes you is how completely the “classical” English novelists have dropped out of favour. It is simply useless to put Dickens, Thackeray, Jane Austen, Trollope, etc, into the ordinary lending library; nobody takes them out… Yet it is always fairly easy to sell DickensI would say the same thing now, of course – no one reads anything from say before 1950… oh, EXCEPT Jane Austen! Number four – in a review of a forgotten prison memoir called  Walls Have Mouths Orwell reveals the ubiquity of homosexual activity up to and including male rape in a paragraph which must have stunned his readers – we were still getting used to this kind of reality in the work of James Gilligan and in movies like  American History X . But hear Orwell :In a convict prison homosexuality is so general that even the jailors are infected by it, and there are actual cases of jailors and convicts competing for the favours of the same nancy-boyWell, we may dislike the homophobic terms Orwell uses but still, again, I was amazed at this subject being given any attention in public in 1936.Number five – reading one of his acknowledged hits “Shooting an Elephant”, and finding out that it was Orwell who shot the elephant! (“I did not want to shoot the elephant”). This was when he was a colonial police officer in Burma. He had a chequered career. Onward to part two."
9642,"As I Please: 1943-1945 (The Collected Essays, Journalism & Letters, Vol. 3)",George Orwell,4.42,289,14,David,5,"Orwell continues to astonish me with(a) his extraordinary - what's the word I'm looking for - ""prolific"" doesn't seem to have an associated noun. Fecundity? Industry? productivity? oh, what the heck - just the sheer volume of his output (b) the quality of his writing, which is clear and devoid of affectation throughout (c) the breadth of his scope (is there anything he doesn't write about?) (d) the acuity of his intellect (e) the depth of his commitment to his political views, which are obviously deeply felt, and which he defends passionately and articulately(f) the *sanity* that pervades all of the pieces in this book, all written at a time when Europe was plunged in chaos, and jingoistic propaganda was the order of the day. It's fascinating to read Orwell's speculation about the likely political structures in postwar Europe, written when Hitler's defeat was by no means a given.I will try to write a more comprehensive review once I finish the next, and final, volume in the series.But it should be obvious by now. This is great stuff!"
9641,Down And Out In Paris And London,George Orwell,4.1,41371,2722,Kimley,5,"Do not read this book if you are unemployed.Do not read this book if you are homeless.Do not read this book if you are worried about the tanking economy.Do not read this book if you have no retirement savings.Do not read this book if you don't like eating stale bread and margarine.Do not read this book if you like eating in restaurants.Do not read this book if you are sensitive to foul odors.Do not read this book if you are one of those people who carries a hand-sanitizer at all times.Do not read this book if you are an artist, writer, musician or other creative occupation which certainly guarantees brushes with poverty.If you do read this book (which I highly recommend) make sure you have some bubble bath on hand as you will need a nice long well-perfumed soak afterwards."
9640,A Collection of Essays,George Orwell,4.3,2967,189,K.D. Absolutely,3,"The best collection of essays that I’ve read so far.14 well-written essays by Eric Arthur Blair (1903-1950) also known as George Orwell. It covers a wide range of topics from his childhood, Spanish Civil War, Mahatma Gandhi, Charles Dickens, Rudyard Kipling, Jewish religion, politics, etc to his shooting of an elephant while serving as a police in Burma. Perfectly-written in his trademark direct, clear and taut writing the style that I first encountered in his political satirical sci-fi 1984 and political fable Animal Farm.The only difference is that these are non-fiction. The essays made me understand what kind of a man George Orwell was: a lover of equality, justice and free will. Such, Such Were the Joys 5 stars - Amazing! A very moving memoir of Orwell’s stay at Crossgates, a school for the rich students in England. He only afforded to go to that school because he was a bright boy. The school kept him because he had a good chance of passing entrance exams in the prestigious universities later and that would help maintaining the image of the school. The one part that I found so sad was that the little George did not have a cake year after year during his stay at that school because his parents could not afford it and this was just one of the ways for a poor but bright pupil could be discriminated. This boyhood memoir is better than Roald Dahl’s Boy: A Story of Childhood as this is more inspiring and meatier. Charles Dickens 5 stars -Amazing!David Copperfield and A Tale of the Two Cities are my two novels that I first read when I was in a fresh college graduate in the mid-80s. That’s why they will always be among my favorite classic works. In this essay, Orwell analyzes the works of Dickens in a way that is very easy to understand and will help you appreciate Dickens as a writer. Orwell said that Dickens is a moralist: he wanted to correct the wrongs that are perpetuated by either those in power or those who were rich in England during his time. However, there are a couple of his works that do not belong to this so-called social propagandist drama and they are A Tale of the Two Cities and Hard Times. All the works, including David Copperfield, Nicholas Nickleby, Oliver Twist, Martin Chuzzlewit and Our Mutual Friend follow a certain formula and fall into the same morality theme. Orwell just made me want to line up next all the other books by Dickens that are in my to-be-read (tbr) file.The Art of Donald McGill 3 stars- I liked it!Donald McGill (1875-1962) was a cartoonist whose comic strips were very popular in England during Orwell’s time. Prior to this, I did not know that Britons would love daily comic strips in a way that I and my friends used to read Baltic and Co. on the dailies when we were growing up. Orwell examined the comic strips over the years and wrote a detailed analysis of its main theme and McGill’s outlook on marriage, sex, gender equality and drunkenness. He did not say that he was McGill’s fan but he would not be able to write his conclusion of this long-running comic strip had he not been a fan. Orwell, a comic strip’s fan?!Rudyard Kipling 4 stars - I really liked it!Orwell gave his view on T. S. Eliot’s defense of Kipling being branded as a “Fascist.” This label seemed to be triggered by Kipling’s written article regarding a white British soldier beating a “nigger” (yes, during that time this “n” word was still printable). Orwell tends to disagree with Eliot by saying that ”there is a definite strain of sadism in him, over and above the brutality which a write of that type has to have. Kipling is a jingo imperialist, he is morally insensitive and aesthetically disgusting.” Juicy, rght? Considering that they were both Englishmen and highly esteemed classic novelists. However, the essay is not all negative about Kipling in Orwell’s point of view. He says that Kipling was the only English write of their time who has added phrases to the language and they all became popular like: East is East and West is West; The white man’s burden; What do they know of England who only England know?; The female of the species is more deadly than the male; Somewhere East of Suez; and Paying the Dane-geld.Raffles and Miss Blandish 4 stars - I really liked it!Detailed comparison between a 501-mystery book, No Orchids for Miss Blandish (1939) by James Hadley Chase and the book that Orwell said to be the book that inspired it, Raffles. I have been looking for a copy of this Miss Blandish book. What Orwell basically gave the plot of the story (about a girl who was raped for a long period of time and she fell in love with her rapist) but I did not take it as a spoiler. Rather, he made me want to order the book via Amazon so I can read it right away. Well, maybe in my next Amazon horde!Shooting the Elephant 5 stars - Amazing!Very short yet I guess this is the best essay in the book. It talks about Orwell’s stay in Burma as a policeman. He hated his job because he feels that the Burmese people do not like English people as they are the colonizers, i.e., oppressors. In this particular essay, there is a runaway elephant that has killed a native. Being a policeman, Orwell is asked to kill the elephant. I will not tell you the rest as it is too much of a spoiler. If you have no time to read the whole book, just read this while standing in the bookstore. I assure you that it will be worth the time and the pressure on your legs. You will get a glimpse – a good glimpse – of what kind of man the young Orwell was that probably drove him to write his books that are said to be anti-totalitarianism.Politics and the English Language 4 stars - I really liked it! Orwell criticizing the way school professors expressed themselves in written form. He even gave excerpts of these English professors’ formal passages. He said that the decline of the English language is brought about by the foolish thoughts of the writers. These thoughts were made possible because of the slovenliness of the English language. Hence, the situation was similar to a man drinking because he feels himself to be a failure and he becomes a complete failure because he drinks. He gamely offered these pieces of advice for writers:(i) Never use a metaphor, simile or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.(ii) Never use a long word where a short one will do.(iii) If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.(iv) Never use the foreign phrase, a scientific word or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.(v) Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous. Reflections of Gandhi 4 stars - I really liked it!Orwell hailed Gandhi and his non-violence but he emphasized that the old man did not do anything without personal ambitions. If E. M. Forster’s Passage to India was about British hypocrisy, there were also a hint of hypocrisy in Gandhi’s stance and writings. For example, when Gandhi was asked what should be done with the Jews in Europe, Gandhi allegedly said that German Jews ought to commit collective suicide, which “would have aroused the world and the people of Germany to Hitler’s violence.” After the war, Gandhi justified himself: the Jews had been killed anyway, and might as well have died significantly. Marrakech 3 stars - I liked it!Before Hitler rose in power in 1931, Jewish jokes were common in Europe. This explained he negative Jewish references that turned me off when I read my first book by Orwell a couple of years back: Down and Out in Paris and London. Now I know better. The Jews have that distinctive look (that was also intimated by Howard Jacobson in his Booker-award winning book, The Finkler Question that was my first book read this year) but they are cunning as they are gutsy in business and fond of money-lending with interest. Well, that was according to Orwell. Looking Back on the Spanish War 3 stars - I liked it!The resistance of the working class against Franco. British, France and Russia sided with the urban trade union members while the Nazis Italy and Germany sided with Franco. However, Orwell questioned the intent of Russia in the war. This should have been an interesting essay but I found that war to have of little impact on me compared to WWII in the Pacific. All I know is that American novelists like Hemingway or Cummings volunteered during this period as ambulance drivers. This was because there was the Great Depression in the States so job was scarce.Inside the Whale5 stars - Amazing!This is about the feeling of claustrophobia that must have been similar to what the prophet Jonas felt while inside the whale. Orwell used as a springboard Henry Miller and his opus The Tropic of Cancer. Orwell praised Miller for his courage of writing something that belong to the 20’s and not in fashion. ”When Tropic of Cancer was published the Italians were marching into Abyssinia and Hitler’s concentration camps were already bulging. The international foci of the of the world were Rome, Moscow, and Berlin. It did not seem to be a moment at which a novel of outstanding value was likely to be written about American dead-beats edging drinks in the Latin Quarter (France). Of course a novelist is not obliged to write directly about contemporary history, but a novelist who simply disregards the major public events of the moment is generally either a footler or a plain idiot.” Orwell went on explaining why he found this Miller book outstanding:”When I first opened Tropic of Cancer and saw that it was full of imprintable words, my immediate reaction was a refusal to be impressed. Most people’s would be the same, I believe. Nevertheless after a lapse of time, the atmosphere of the book, besides innumerable details, seemed to linger in my memory in a peculiar way. Together with his other book, Black Spring, these two books “created a world of their own” as the saying goes. The books that do this are not necessarily good books, they maybe good bad books like Raffles or the Sherlock Holmes stories, or perverse and morbid books like Wuthering Heights or The House of the Green Shutters… Read him (Miller) for five pages, ten pages, and you feel the peculiar relief that comes not so much from understanding as from being understood. ” He knows all about me,” you feel; “he wrote this especially for me.” It is as though you could hear a voice speaking to you, a friendly American voice, with no humbug in it, no moral purpose, merely an implicit assumption that we are all alike.” England Your England 3 stars - I liked it!An essay that he wrote while Nazi airplanes were flying on the British skies dropping bombs. Contains his many complaints about Britain’s political system, its stand during the war, its alliances, its expanding middle class, etc. Boys’ Weeklies 4 stars - I really liked it!Orwell sold newspaper dailies when he was a young boy and this essay includes his analysis of the dailies during his time. I don’t know of any newspapers in Britain so I was not able to relate to this one. However, I also sold newspapers in the province when I was a young boy. Why I Write 5 stars - Amazing!From the tender age of 5 or 6, Orwell already knew that he wanted to become a writer. He was the only boy in the family of 4 that includes his mother and two sisters , older and younger. He was a lonely boy probably because he did grow up with a father and he found comfort in books: reading stories and novels and and writing poetry. At the age of 16, he read Milton’s Paradise Lost that made him realized that the beauty of the English language. He gave the following as motivations the drive writers to write: (1) Sheer egoism(2) Esthetic enthusiasm(3) Historical impulse(4) Political purposeOrwell did not say it but I think the last one was what drove him to write 1984 and Animal Farm. He wanted “to push the world in a certain direction, to alter other people’s idea of the kind of society that they should strive after. No book is genuinely free from political bias. The opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude.” (p. 313).Sorry for the long review. I was just carried away by this book. I did not know that reading essays could be as exciting and enriching as reading works of fiction."
9645,Nineteen Eighty-Four,George Orwell,4.14,2096859,46564,Silvana,5,"WAR IS PEACE.FREEDOM IS SLAVERY.IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.Those words keep sounding in my head since I read this book. Gosh, probably the most haunting not to mention frightening book I've ever read. 1984 should also be included in the horror genre.1984 describes a Utopia. Not Thomas More's version of Utopia, but this is one is the antithesis, i.e. Dystopia. Imagine living in a country, whose leaders apply a totalitarian system in regulating their citizen, in the most extreme ways, which make Hitler, Mao, Stalin and that old bloke in V for Vendetta look like sissies.Working, eating, drinking, sleeping, talking, thinking, procreating...in short living, all are controlled by the state. Any hint of obedience or dislike can be detected by various state apparatus such as the Thought Police, telescreen, or even your children, who will not hesitate to betray you to the authorities. Even language is modified in such ways that you cannot express yourself, since individualism is a crime.The past is controlled, rewritten into something that will strengthen the incumbent ruler. Who controls the past, controls the future. Who controls the present, controls the past. There is no real truth. The ""truth"" is what the state says it is. Black is white, 2+2=5, if the state says so.The world in 1984 is divided into three states, originated from the ashes from World War II: Oceania (British Isles, the Americas, Pacific, Australia), Eurasia (Europe & Russia), and Eastasia (the rest of it). Continuous warfare between those three (who hold similar ideologies) is required to keep the society's order and peace. Si vis pacem para bellum. That's describes the first slogan.The second slogan, freedom is slavery, means the only way to be free is by letting you lose yourself and to be integrated within the Party. That way, you'll be indestructible and immortal.Ignorance is strength, means the division on high, middle, low classes in society will never be changed. The middle wants to be the high and they'll act ""on behalf of the low"" to dethrone the high. Afterwards, a new middle class arises, all will change except the low. The high and middle make and uphold the law, the low (proletarian) is just too stupid to revolt. The state maintains its structure by torture, intimidation, violence, and brainwashing.Blimey, Orwell's Animal Farm is already depressing, but 1984 gives ""depression"" a new meaning, at least for me."
880,Pompeii,Robert   Harris,3.79,27116,1851,Lance Greenfield,5,"This is the story of a latter day Super Mario, an Italian plumber who overcomes very difficult challenges to fix the water supply to Napoli and surrounding areas before the local volcano erupts to ruin everything for everybody. OK, I admit that I am grossly trivialising a tremendous story, which is really about Marcus Attilius Primus, the aquarius, or chief water engineer, who is sent to the Bay of Naples to manage the water supply to all of the towns in the area. The main artery of the supply is the aqueduct, Aqua Augusta, which Attilius's grandfather may have had a hand in building under the supervision of the great Agrippa. Water engineering has been the career path of Atillius's family back through at least four generations.From the off, Attilius is up against it. His predecessor disappeared mysteriously, and neither his team of engineers and slaves nor those masters who govern Naples and the surrounding area, are inclined to trust the new aquarius. The first chapter opens with the horrendous execution of a slave who has been held responsible for the deaths of one of the local lord's prize fish. The lord's daughter, accompanied by the unfortunate slave's mother, urgently seek the help of Attilius, who quickly discovers that it is something in the water which has killer the precious fish. But they are too late to save the wretched slave.Events unfold and develop during the two days leading up to the famous eruption which buried Pompeii.This is a rivetting read, if ever there was one. As you would expect, there are many dangers to overcome, and, as you read, you will be wondering who will survive and who will not. This does not become clear until the final pages. I have to confess that I was wishing for the demise of certain characters, whilst hoping for the survival of others. That is a sign of how well Robert Harris engages the reader with the actors in this story.Definitely merits five stars."
7865,Days Between Stations,Steve Erickson,4.03,730,56,Szplug,4,"Erickson's first novel set the stage for the themes, scapes, and styles that would recur throughout his later books, and showed him already firmly in control of his own particularly effective and evocative surreal strokes layered upon a textual canvas. Within a world in which the elements themselves are affected by the emotional turmoil of the principal characters, in which select colour schemes interpose themselves across time and space upon both nature and the products of man's labour, Erickson's protagonists swim against the tide of normal existence, engaged in a vast and reality-bending struggle for their battered souls. At the very heart of this tempestuous trial is love, filtered through the author's jagged prism into a rainbow spray of feverish obsession, fiery sexual passion, an interchanging positioning of dominance and submission, master and slave—one in which roles are ofttimes suddenly, and unexpectedly, exchanged—and which, in its habit of soaking into every fibre of the character's mind, body, and spirit, exerts an overwhelming power to drive all other concerns or distractions or obligations into the background, to make the beloved a quest that cannot be denied, even across death; a potent, immense, and invariably distorted fetish that wreaks its power to heal and harm across generations. That the son (or daughter) will pay for the sins of the father (or mother) is as close to a hard and fast rule as exists when Erickson sets out to chain his roiling creations to the page in ink-black bonds.Adolphe Sarre—one of a pair of infant twins abandoned in turn-of-the-century France—is taken in as the clandestine house-son of an especially upscale and selective Parisian brothel. Growing up surrounded by sexually provocative and alternatively forceful and yielding women, hidden from the clientele, and knowing as kindred kin only the winsomely beautiful Janine—slightly younger than himself—the only daughter of a dusky and exotic fair-haired Tunisian slave (whom Sarre mistakenly believes to be his blood mother as well), Sarre—confined in his windowless chamber—develops a unique visual understanding of and power over light. He comes to comprehend the world as, in effect, a giant, living flat-screen—a cinema—in which, in Platonic fashion, the brilliant and searing light of the actually existing world projects its images and actions onto this two-dimensional surface; this projection has fooled us, the shadow puppets, into believing the world contains a depth and reality that simply is not there. When he is forced to flee the brothel after a nearly murderous intervention between Janine and her half-brother—Sarre, obsessively in love with Janine, is resigned to the incestuous curse he mistakenly believes his love to be tainted with—the strange-eyed teen eventually winds up utilizing his uncanny comprehension of light—and its various patent and subtle capacities both in our world and when captured by the camera—to become an enigmatic auteur movie director. Whilst filming his masterpiece, The Death of Marat, he casts Janine as Corday. As the filming spreads over years instead of weeks, the studio funding ebbs and flows while Sarre and Janine engage in a torrid and strangled love affair. Eventually, Sarre must make a choice between Marat or Janine—and the decision he makes—and the revelation he is given immediately after making his choice—will set in motion a disturbance in the very structures of reality that will echo and abound across two generations of his descendents—the children born by Janine during their heated tryst. Lovers will be reincarnated, love affairs reignited, by a sequence of dream debts incurred and payments rendered by estranged relations and restrung instruments that reappear on the scene, conducted by the mordant and arrant hand of fate.Sarre's familial chain, and their impacted destinies, are bound up in the very nature of twins, of a single soul divided between two individuals during the process of birth. A pattern of one of the twins disappearing—and subsequently held to be dead—establishes itself across the generations, as well as a devastatingly melancholy cycle of return, in which this searingly obsessive love, this fixation born of the thrashings and caresses of lust, taints every path and decision and kin sprung from the tortured figure of Sarre. Nature itself is inveigled into mounting a furious attack against this time-and-death defying love—vicious sandstorms devastate a Los Angeles where Sarre's grandson, Adrien-Michel, is set upon a desperate struggle for possession of his fixated desire, the blonde-maned Lauren, wed to the incarnation of male beauty and infidelity; Europe is beset by ferocious winters of increasing length and severity, which freeze waterways and bodies with harsh unconcern; and the oceans themselves withdraw into sullen seclusion, creating vast stretches of new beaches and leaving cities like Venice, with its famous canals, perched in drydock far above bone-dry former seabeds. And everywhere electrical power is stuttering and faltering, blackouts increasing in duration and scope, while roadways and transport networks are abandoned to the new armies of scouring winds.Erickson has always been an apocalyptic writer, able to find endless means to wring loss and grief out of his character's lives, in amounts large enough to drive them mad. This madness is always reflected in the landscapes, which take the shape and hues of a dream world, and unfold with the surreal and law-defying antics of the realm of sleep. Erickson never fails to deliver with these imaginative settings, and in Days Between Stations he comes through in spades. With the colour blue prominent throughout the pages—never more so than in the bit of sailor's magic that seemingly captures (twin?) souls from the air and imprisons them within a bottle of cognac—there are also brilliant distortions of time and its temporal treadmill, the imbuing of semen with the power to transport old spirits into the immature bodies of the new, to snuff out burgeoning lives and active memories and replace them with a honeycombed amnesia echoing the pained and longing ruptures of those on the verge of expiring. There is a cycle race in Venice, in particular, that is just perfectly, astoundingly constructed. In Erickson's warped and disturbing vision of the world, we are but travelers, often enacting pantomimes, determined to impose our own wills upon a world that laughs at these misguided displays of purpose and cowers us with its trump cards of fate and time. Even the simple act of uttering a solitary word can become an enormous and taxing struggle, the vocalization emblazoned with a deeper explosive potentiality the more it becomes entangled and stuck within the strangled hollows of the throat. We can run, we can race, travel halfway around the world in an effort to outrun our sins or delusional attempts at atonement—yet seemingly always wind up right where we started, forced to confront the mess we have created and be made aware of all the avenues of pain and devastation that have been paved while we were lost in flight. Sarre, in opting for the completion of The Death of Marat, not only abandoned his love, but all chances at completing the film that he wrenched from his lacerated spirit—and though the completion of this film would obsess (or revulse) descendants and strangers, it was doomed from the second he let Janine go. Out of the ruins and ravages of this very-human emotion Erickson always offers up a glimpse of hope—but only after setting in place a multitude of traps and illusionary snares on the road to embracing it."
6145,The Moonstones,Jean Thesman,3.83,46,4,Alissa,4,"Yet another Under The Radar Gem! The Moonstones was a lovely little summery romance between two very unlikely characters.When cautious, careful Jane travels with her mother to Royal Bay, a desolate seaside town near Puget Sound, to help get her late grandmother's estate in order, the last thing she expects to find is love. Then she catches a glimpse of Carey, a local boy from the wrong side of the tracks. Although the two are opposites, there is an undeniable attraction between them at first sight. But a romance may never happen. Carey and his friends hang out each night at an abandoned amusement park, a place Jane's mother forbids her to go. Besides, Jane and her mother will be leaving soon to go back to Seattle...Then comes the arrival of Jane's Aunt Norma and cousin Ricki, who is wild, daring, and just about as mean as a mean girl can get. Ricki convinces Jane to sneak out and go to the amusement park. Here, she gets to know Carey. A true summer romance between the two of them begins to blossom. But not all is sunshine and sandcastles. A vicious family drama between Jane's mom and aunt is revived--and this unpleasant history threatens to repeat itself with Jane and Ricki. With so much tension back at grandmother's house, Jane's only escape is her forbidden meetings with Carey. But is even this bright spot safe?Although dated (no cell phones, no texting, no internet, no email), The Moonstones is a lovely little romance. The interaction between Carey and Jane is innocent enough to be recommended to younger readers, but older readers will appreciate the dynamics. Plus, there's enough drama to keep fans of The Clique and Gossip Girl interested."
2880,"Bleach, Volume 01",Tite Kubo,4.21,122808,933,Laurel,5,"This manga series is absolutely amazing! Anyone considering whether or not to read this manga, read it now! And for those of you currently reading the series but not yet finished with all the books, you will be blown away by Tite Kubo's advancement in skill! The beginning of bleach has amazing artwork, and at the end there's such an incredible improvement in the way he draws the characters... Even when I thought (after reading the first book) there was no room for Tite Kubo to improve, since he was already such an amazing mangaka. The storyline is truly amazing (and still ongoing, might I add) and blew me away! And, even though I don't usually dwell on things like clothes, the clothes are absolutely amazing! All the different designs he's thought up... In all previous mangas I've read, the mangaka will stick to a few sets of outfits for his characters to wear, but Tite Kubo goes all out! Especially in the filler sketches... I feel as if I am rambling, but the point is, this is a truly amazing manga, and that it should be read right away!"
2874,The Lady and the Unicorn,Tracy Chevalier,3.67,35497,1644,CatarinaG,5,"Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful!I found Lady and the Unicorn even better than Girl with a Pearl Earring. I felt utterly transported to the middle ages and immersed in a very good tale, immaculately told.As she did with The Girl With the Pearl Earring, Tracy Chevalier takes a classic work of art and artfully spins a tale inspired by the original which becomes an original itself.It was specially fascinating living among the Brussels weavers and coming to understand the magnitude of their task. One almost feels their physical discomfort and certainly the realities of a labor intensive craft. It was the part of the book I most enjoyed.Next time I go to Paris I will not miss the Cluny Museum to see the tapestries for myself!Meanwhile we can see them (in full size) at VanderNat's home page or at Tracy Chevalier's official site One of the most beautifull books I have ever read :)Now on I will look for the color blue in old tapestries with 'other eyes'. ;)"
2879,"Bleach, Volume 15",Tite Kubo,4.41,17467,65,Nick,5,"Overall Rating: A+Synopsis: Ichigo Kurosaki sees ghosts, and fights...a lot. All of this is pretty normal for Ichigo, but then he meets Rukia Kuchiki, a Shinigami (Death God) and member of the mysterious Soul Society. When a Hollow, an evil spirit, attacks Ichigo and his family, Rukia attempts to defeat the Hollow, but is wounded. To help him save his family, she lends Ichigo some of her powers, but something goes wrong, and Ichigo absorbs every last drop of her energy. Ichigo becomes a temporary Shinigami, and works with Rukia to handle the hunting of hollows until Rukia can recover. At least, that was the plan...Before I picked up the manga, I saw the first four episodes of the anime at Stellarcon '06. It was a fansub (this was before it was airing on Adult Swim), so the translation wasn't great, but I fell in love with the characters and mythology of the series. I immediately started picking up the manga and planning a costume for Ichigo. A few months later, I cosplayed Ichigo at Heroescon, had read all of the manga that had been translated, and watched as much of the anime as I could get my hands on.So, what's the big deal, right? I think it comes down to the characters. There are dozens of of them, and the writer Tite Kubo takes the time to give them all detailed backgrounds and relationships. I'm 19 volumes in, and while there's plenty of action, it's the character development I'm hooked to.In the first 19 volumes, there are three main groups of characters, humans, the Shingami, and the Quincies. When humans die, their souls become Wholes or Hollows. Wholes are normal spirits, but the spirits that become Hollows are corrupted souls that must feed on the souls of the living (kind of like spiritual vampires). The Shinigami release Wholes and help them cross over to the Soul Society (the spirit world), and cleanse the Hollows so that they can cross over as well. They do so using big ass swords called zanpakutō.The Quincies use bows made of spiritual energy in the form of bows to hunt Hollows, similarly to the Shinigami. However, unlike the Shingami, who purify the souls of the Hollows preserving the balance of souls between the two world, the Quincies destroy them. This endangers the balance of the world, and as a result the two groups went to war. The Shinigami won, and there is now only one Quincy left, Uryū Ishida. Despite his hatred of Shinigami, Uryū eventually becomes friends Ichigo, and even travels to the Soul Society with him. This only scratches at the surface of the series. I have only seen ~50 episodes of the anime, but what I have seen follows the manga very closely. I highly recommend checking out the series, it's fun, interesting, and has some great cosplay opportunities.For more manga and anime reviews, please check out Hobotaku."
1984,Bleak House,Charles Dickens,4,76780,3192,Jessica,4,"Shivering in unheated gaslit quarters (Mrs. Winklebottom, my plump and inquisitive landlady, treats the heat as very dear, and my radiator, which clanks and hisses like the chained ghost of a boa constrictor when it is active, had not yet commenced this stern and snowy morning), I threw down the volume I had been endeavoring to study; certainly I am not clever, neither am I intrepid nor duly digligent, as after several pages I found the cramped and tiny print an intolerable strain on my strabismic eyes. Straightening my bonnet, I passed outdoors into the frigid, sooty streets, where shoppers bustled by in a frenzy, now rushing into the 99-cent store, bedecked with PVC Santa Claus banners, now into Nelson's Xmas Shoppe, in search of glistening ornaments. Bowing my head perversely against busy crowds and fierce wind, I stepped into a subway, which conveyed me to a winding street down which I hurried until I reached a peculiar establishment, the shingle for which had been battered by the strain of city winters, by pollution, and no doubt by the small mischievious hands of vandals, who had modified the sign with their colorful signatures and illustrations, but upon which could still be read - with some effort - Amperthump & Hagglestern, Booksellers.I entered to a sound of tinkling bells affixed to the heavy door, the hinges of which creaked as I propelled myself through its narrow passage. Proceeding forward, I heard a sullen voice squeak, ""Check yer bag, miss?"" and glanced up to see an urchin, nearly lost amidst piles of remaindered volumes, beckoning with one grubby hand while clutching a wrinkled comic in the other; I refused, smiling gently, and passed into the densely cluttered shop, where I was intercepted by Mr. Amperthump, the proprietor, a gentleman of about three and forty, whose thick-rimmed spectacles and corpulent physique recall two of a tragic trinity of dead singers, who upon seeing me took my cold hands in his ink-stained ones and kissed them. ""How can I assist, my dear?"" he boomed so loudly that a little one-eyed spaniel started from its slumber, and the urchins shelving books glared up at their master with undisguised annoyance.Drawing out my small copy of Bleak House, which I had obtained from the Queens Public Library -- supported, to wonderous effect, by the subsciption of tax dollars, and no doubt supplemented by charitable impulses of certain gentleladies -- and endeavored to explain, as simply as I could, that I desired an edition of the same narrative writ larger and in more mercifully legible print. However Mr. Amperthump appeared distressed and could not remain silent long, flinging my book away. ""NO!"" he cried. ""You are too young and pretty"" (at this I blushed and tried to protest, for I am not pretty, in fact I am plain) ""to be reading this antiquated rot! Here, instead, is the latest experimental fiction from Rajistan D. McGingerloop."" At this he placed in my hands a queer volume, unlike any I had seen before. ""Throughout his controversial career McGingerloop has exploded one by one conventions of the novel... in this latest work he has done away with pages!"" And indeed, when I examined the book I discovered he was quite right, and that the book I held was a brick of paper, and could not be opened, having as he indicated, no pages at all. I thanked Mr. Amperthump for his solicitude, at which point he pressed that I try Petunia al Gonzalez-Mjobebe's story of a love affair between an Iranian transexual and a Chinese android, a meditation, Mr. Amperthump assured me, on globalization and identity, but also, he said, a suspenseful legal thriller in its own right, albeit one subverting the conventions of that genre - quite, he added, subversively. Finally I was given to understand that in addition to Mr. Amperthump's conviction that I should not be reading Dickens, he had none in stock, and finally I gave my thanks for all his kindness and passed out again into the filthy snow and gloom."

11,"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, #1)",Douglas Adams,4.2,1015984,20821,J.G. Keely,5,"The universe is a joke. Even before I was shown the meaning of life in a dream at 17 (then promptly forgot it because I thought I smelled pancakes), I knew this to be true--and yet, I have always felt a need to search for the truth, that nebulous, ill-treated creature. Adams has always been, to me, to be a welcome companion in that journey. Between the search for meaning and the recognition that it's all a joke in poor taste lies Douglas Adams, and, luckily for us, he doesn't seem to mind if you lie there with him. He's a tall guy, but he'll make room.For all his crazed unpredictability, Adams is a powerful rationalist. His humor comes from his attempts to really think through all the things we take for granted. It turns out it takes little more than a moment's questioning to burst our preconceptions at the seams, yet rarely does this stop us from treating the most ludicrous things as if they were perfectly reasonable.It is no surprise that famed atheist Richard Dawkins found a friend and ally in Adams. What is surprising is that people often fail to see the rather consistent and reasonable philosophy laid out by Adams' quips and absurdities. His approach is much more personable (and less embittered) than Dawkins', which is why I think of Adams as a better face for rational materialism (which is a polite was of saying 'atheism').Reading his books, it's not hard to see that Dawkins is tired of arguing with uninformed idiots who can't even recognize when a point has actually been made. Adams' humanism, however, stretched much further than the contention between those who believe, and those who don't.We see it from his protagonists, who are not elitist intellectuals--they're not even especially bright--but damn it, they're trying.

1986,Oliver Twist,Charles Dickens,3.85,256780,5406,Stephen,5," I looooooooved this book. Another Dickens...another favorite. 'Please, sir, I want some more.' Jane Austen and Charles Dickens have been dueling inside my WOW center for some time in a titanic, see-saw struggle for the title of greatest word-smither/story-crafter in all of English literature. Ms Austen previously caused heart-palpitations and a slew of gasms with Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility which left me spent like a cheap nickel. However, Sir Dickens, being a slick, wily devil responded in kind with A Tale of Two Cities and Great Expectations, a pair of wonderfully addictive, tingle causing joy blasts full of jaw-drops and breezy elegance. Where this battle of master word charmers will end….I could really care less because I’m sporting a complete happy going through their respective catalogs with a perma-smile on my face. Next up on the parade of mouth-watering, phrase turning feasts is The Adventures of Oliver Twist which is terrific on several levels. In relating the tragic (but ultimately rewarding) life of Oliver Twist, Dickens is at his most Austenesque as he employs with great effect biting sarcasm and dry, dark humor to scathingly satire the English Poor Laws of the 1830s. Of the novels I’ve read by Dickens, this is him at his most “socially conscious” and he strategically uses Oliver’s biography to harshly spotlight the greed, hypocrisy and let’s just say it…evil…of the society that organized and profited by the work house system of the middle 19th century.   So they established the rule, that all poor people should have the alternative (for they would compel nobody, not they,) of being starved by a gradual process in the house, or by a quick one out of it.
 We follow Oliver beginning with his difficult birth that killed his mother and almost cost the young lad his life as well. 
  [T]here was considerable difficulty in inducing Oliver to take upon himself the office of respiration- a troublesome practice, but one which custom has rendered necessary to our easy existence…
 From there we journey with the child as he is dumped into a workhouse where his early life goes from bad to horrendously shitty as he’s subjected to a systematic process of neglect, physical brutality and starvation along with the other children residing there. Here is a passage from Chapter 2 that I think perfectly encapsulates the subtly sarcastic style Dickens employs to address his subject matter. 
  The parish authorities magnanimously and humanely resolved, that Oliver should be ‘farmed,’ or, in other words, that he should be dispatched to a branch-workhouse some three miles off, where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders against the poor-laws rolled about the floor all day, without the inconvenience of too much food, or too much clothing, under the parental superintendence of an elderly female who received the culprits at and for the consideration of sevenpence-halfpenny per small head per week. Sevenpence-halfpenny’s worth per week is a good round diet for a child; a great deal may be got for sevenpence-halfpenny, quite enough to overload its stomach, and make it uncomfortable. The elderly female was a woman of wisdom and experience; she knew what was good for children; and she had a very accurate perception of what was good for herself. So, she appropriated the greater part of the weekly stipend to her own use, and consigned the rising parochial generation to even shorter allowance than was originally provided for them. Thereby finding in the lowest depth a deeper still; and proving herself a very great experimental philosopher. Everybody knows the story of another experimental philosopher who had a great theory about a horse being able to live without eating, and who demonstrated it so well, that he got his own horse down to a straw a day, and would unquestionably have rendered him a very spirited and rapacious animal on nothing at all, if he had not died, four and twenty hours before he was to have had his first comfortable bait of air. Unfortunately for the experimental philosopher of the female to whose care Oliver Twist was delivered over, a similar result usually attended the operation of her system; for at the very moment when a child had contrived to exist upon the smallest possible portion of the weakest possible food, it did perversely happen in eight and a half cases out of ten, either that it sickened from want and cold, or fell into the fire from neglect, or got half-smothered by accident; in any one of which cases, the miserable little being was usually summoned into another world, and there gathered to the fathers it had never known in this. 
 I love the way Dickens can describe callous starvation and casual murder of children for nothing more than greed in such a way that I was actually chuckling because of his lusciously humorous phrasing. This man could write.Eventually, Oliver’s life takes another turn from horrendously shitty to mega-painful-chunks-of-misery-filled-crap when he has the temerity to utter the famous words,  “Please, sir, I want some more."" He gets more…more beatings, more starvation,more verbal abuse,more neglect,…and ultimately finds himself alone on the streets with no means of survival. There, Oliver finds himself sucked into a life of petty criminality under the tutelage of “Fagin the Jew” who I thought was one of the most compelling Dickens characters ever.**[**Note: I know there is a lot of controversy about the portrayal of Fagin being one of the most egregious cases of anti-Semitism in classic literature. I think the criticism is fair, but I also don’t think (based on what I’ve read) that Dickens’ had any malicious intent. It is what it is and everyone can make their own decision on that point.] I thought the character of Fagin was fascinating and his signature phrase my dear (which he uses in almost every sentence) is still popping into my head more than a week after finishing the novel. Fagin, while irredeemably evil and in some ways a criminal caricature, Dickens draws him with such flair imbues him with a dimension and essence that I found very compelling. His psychology, his calculating intelligence and his soft words masking despicable actions is deftly laid out. At times, I almost got the impression that Fagin was intended to represent “the devil himself” with the way Dickens focuses on his corrupting influence. 
  In short, the wily old Jew had the boy in his toils; and, having prepared his mind by solitude and gloom to prefer any society to the companionship of his own sad thoughts in such a dreary place, was now slowly instilling into his soul the poison which he hoped would blacken it and change its hue for ever. 
 On one level, the life of Oliver Twist is one of the harshest, most depressingly sad tales ever put to paper. In lesser hands, the heartache and forlornness of Oliver’s birth and tragic early life could have swallowed up the story and made the book a real chore to get through. Good news…these are not lesser hands.Dickens writing is so melodic that the narrative glides over the horror at a safe middle-distance, allowing us to observe and absorb the surroundings without drowning in the pain that Dickens describes. I thought it was masterful. Intimate yet detached. Eventually, the plot takes a mysterious turn as a shadowy figure arrives on the scene who has a connection to Oliver and his past that is slowly revealed over the last half of the story. All of this leads to a marvelous ending that makes the rest of the story far more enjoyable in retrospect…sometimes positive, warm and fuzzy resolutions are exactly what a story needs. Dickens prose is buttery smooth while his mocking humor is cheddar sharp. His balance is outstanding and his ability to poke fun at his readers’ society while avoiding making the reader themselves feel like a target is brilliant. I had such a wonderful time reading this that I am left wondering why everyone doesn’t love Dickens as much as I do. 5.0 stars. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!Okay, Ms. Austen…your turn again. "
12,"The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide: Five Complete Novels and One Story (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, #1-5)",Douglas Adams,4.38,240369,4326,J.G. Keely,5,"The universe is a joke. Even before I was shown the meaning of life in a dream at 17 (then promptly forgot it because I thought I smelled pancakes), I knew this to be true--and yet, I have always felt a need to search for the truth, that nebulous, ill-treated creature. Adams has always been, to me, to be a welcome companion in that journey. Between the search for meaning and the recognition that it's all a joke in poor taste lies Douglas Adams, and, luckily for us, he doesn't seem to mind if you lie there with him. He's a tall guy, but he'll make room.For all his crazed unpredictability, Adams is a powerful rationalist. His humor comes from his attempts to really think through all the things we take for granted. It turns out it takes little more than a moment's questioning to burst our preconceptions at the seams, yet rarely does this stop us from treating the most ludicrous things as if they were perfectly reasonable.It is no surprise that famed atheist Richard Dawkins found a friend and ally in Adams. What is surprising is that people often fail to see the rather consistent and reasonable philosophy laid out by Adams' quips and absurdities. His approach is much more personable (and less embittered) than Dawkins', which is why I think of Adams as a better face for rational materialism (which is a polite was of saying 'atheism').Reading his books, it's not hard to see that Dawkins is tired of arguing with uninformed idiots who can't even recognize when a point has actually been made. Adams' humanism, however, stretched much further than the contention between those who believe, and those who don't.We see it from his protagonists, who are not elitist intellectuals--they're not even especially bright--but damn it, they're trying. By showing a universe that makes no sense and having his characters constantly question it, Adams is subtly hinting that this is the natural human state, and the fact that we laugh and sympathize shows that it must be true.It's all a joke, it's all ridiculous. The absurdists might find this depressing, but they're just a bunch of narcissists, anyhow. Demnading the world make sense and give you purpose is rather self centered when it already contains toasted paninis, attractive people in bathing suits, and Euler's Identity. I say let's sit down at the bar with the rabbi, the priest, and the frog and try to get a song going. Or at least recognize that it's okay to laugh at ourselves now and again. It's not the end of the world.It's just is a joke, but only some of us are in on it."
407,Great Jones Street,Don DeLillo,3.47,2440,160,Glenn Russell,5,"Great Jones Street – Don DeLillo’s novel published as part of the 1980s Vintage Contemporaries series where a young rock-and-roll artist seals himself off in a Lower Manhattan down-and-out apartment. Well, there’s the occasional visit from his girlfriend and members of his rock group and hawkers connected with a Happy Valley Commune yammering about a future miracle drug, enough visits to keep his sharp edge very sharp and enough visits to possibly drive a crazy boy crazy. And here's our man, the one and only Bucky Wunderlick, musing on the mystical nature of his girlfriend and soulmate, the incomparable Opel: ""All she desired was the brute electricity of that sound. To forget everything. To be that sound. That was the only tide she heeded. She wanted to exist as music does, nowhere, beyond the maps of language."" A batch of reasons why this novel by Don DeLillo is fab:THE BOX MAN, AMERICAN-STYLEWithin months of publication of Great Jones Street another new novel hit the shelves addressing many of the same themes: The Box Man by Nobel winning Japanese novelist, Kōbō Abe, where the nameless protagonist surrenders his previous identity and conventional routine to live in a large cardboard box he wears over his head. Great Jones Street and The Box Man – so into yourself, so “society get out of my face.” At one point in DeLillo’s novel, girlfriend Opel tells Bucky about a new underground counterculture group: “The return of the private man, according to them, is the only way to destroy the notion of mass man.” Oh, Opel. Oh, Bucky. Oh, Box Man. This is so 70s! Sidebar: I recall watching a 1970s newscast where a university student wore a black cloth over his head down to his shoes and walked around campus calling himself “the black bag.” Actually, I thought this guy really cool.POETRYAt one point, Bucky reflects: “Alone I lived in the emergency of minutes, in phases of dim compliance with the mind’s turning hand.” And here’s another of his rock-and-roll reveries: “Euphoric with morphine we’d be wheeled among them, noting proportions and contours, admiring the beauty of what we were.” It’s as if Bucky’s words could have been excerpts from Alan Ginsberg’s many page beatnik slam-poem “Howl.” And there are numerous other such Bucky rant-lines for fans of DeLillo’s poetic, philosophic prose. THE WRITER IN THE APARTMENT ABOVE “Some writers presume to be men of letters. I’m a man of numbers.” So says the novelist, essayist, poet, short story writer Fenig, who lives in the apartment on Great Jones Street right above Bucky and who is a writer obsessed with seeking fame and knowing the ups and downs of the writer’s market better than a seasoned stock broker knows Wall Street. Don DeLillo, you sly dog, putting a writer who might be the shadow side of yourself in the apartment above your protagonist. ROCK-AND-ROLL, THE NEW MODERN ARTIn an interview, Bucky pontificates how when people read a book or look at a painting, they just sit there or stand there, but through his music, he makes people move. WOW! The one and only Bucky Wunderlick, shining star, prime mover, kinesthetic force, creator of a new political-erotic-mystical art form that, as sculptor Claes Oldenburg insisted, does more than just sit on its ass in a museum. SOCIAL COMMENTARYAgain, Don DeLillo fans will not be disappointed since many are the zingers hurled at contemporary American society. For example, how TV programs are interrupted and announcers sound close to insanity, their voices soaring, as they report on the impending snowstorm: heavy snow, deep snow, drifting snow, big fluffy white flakes are falling and will continue to fall from the sky. (I myself am always both amused and amazed at the panic snow arouses in the media). And, again: Bucky has issues with his hard-earned money having to work . . . no, no, no, he did the work; he wants his money resting in nice big green stacks in some cool bank vault. He’s told in so many words: so sorry, Bucky, like it or not, your rich ass is tied into the American financial world! BUCKY’S MAGICAL MYSTERY TOURInserted into the first-person narrative is the Superslick Mind-Contracting Media Kit featuring The Bucky Wunderlick Story told in various news clips, song lyrics and Zen-like enigmatic responses to interviewers. All very fitting since Bucky’s words have that ring of rock-and-roll truth, when he states further on in the story, “Beauty is dangerous in narrow times, a knife in the slender neck of the rational man, and only those who live between the layers of these strange days can know its name and shape.” Yea, baby! Hearing such wisdom I have to ask: What’s the sound of one Bucky turning at thirty-three and a third, second cut, side one, third album? THE FIGURATIVE DEATH-IN-LIFE JOURNEYBucky wants us to know his solitary journey on Great Jones Street is only the literal way of looking at things. Figuratively, he tells us, he lived in a remote monastery with the lamas of Tibet, being guided through the mysteries of the highest levels, the most esoteric planes of death. That’s what he came to know. Death-in-life. Oh, how cool is that! Thanks, Don D. You rock!"
4805,The Illustrated Longitude: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time,Dava Sobel,3.95,42783,1949,Pramod Nair,4,"Longitude from Dava Sobel is a fascinating account of how a virtually unknown watchmaker named John Harrison conquered one of the oldest and thorniest problems surrounding the ocean voyages - the problem of accurately measuring longitude -, which stumped even the best of scientific minds for centuries. A fascinating problemIt was Ptolemy in ‘Geographia’, written in the 2nd century, who contributed the concept of a co-ordinate system based on the imaginary lines of latitude and longitude, for accurately plotting any spot on the surface of earth. With these imaginary lines he bought a new light in to the maritime explorations and map-making methods of his time. The sailors while at the ocean found it pretty straightforward to find their current latitude - which is drawn parallel to each other while girdling the globe – by measuring the height of the sun or any known celestial bodies. But accurately measuring their current longitude was an entirely different case, as the longitudinal lines loop from the North Pole to the South Pole and back again in great circles, which converge at the ends of the earth. Since it is an angular measurement, which is based on time, the sailors had to have access to two different times - the current time on-board the vessel and the time at a known and pre-selected longitudinal location – at the same instance for calculating the hour differences to work out the geographical separation and the longitude. From a modern viewpoint with our easy-to-carry accurate time-telling devices and instant communication this problem, which a sailor faced in finding the exact time at two different locations, may feel far-fetched. But a sailor in the middle of an ocean pre-dating 18th century only had limited resources in the form of either a pendulum driven clock which was not at all reliable – as the factors like gravity, motion of the vessel, temperature and atmospheric pressure affected the pendulum and there by the time – or by comparing positions of moon or planets like Mars with their anticipatory positions in working out the longitudinal values; both these methods were crude with a high level of inaccuracy.Since the days of Ptolemy, legendary scientific and exploratory minds like Amarigo Vespucci, Sir Issac Newton and Galileo Galilei did a lot of research into this matter but it took sixteen more centuries for mankind to finally invent a reliable solution for this problem.A tragedy & the declaration of a prize moneyIn 1707, a British fleet of vessels under Admiral Sir Clowdesley Shovell met with a tragic disaster as the result of miscalculations in their whereabouts leading to the sinking of four warships with a death toll of more than 1600 mariners. This disaster and huge protest from the merchants and seamen resulted in the formation of a parliamentary committee for finding a practical solution for the longitude problem. This was followed by the 1714 ‘Longitude Act’ by the parliament, which promised a prize money of £ 20,000 for a suitable solution. Dava Sobel covers this formation of the committee and the announcement of the reward in detail.Sir Issac Newton, who was consulted by the committee, at first suggested the idea of a ‘watch’ for tackling the longitude problem.“One method is by a Watch to keep time exactly. But, by reason of the motion of the Ship, the Variation of Heat and Cold, Wet and Dry, and the Difference of Gravity in different Latitudes, such a watch hath not yet been made.”But he believed that such a watch with too many technical challenges was not going to be a reality and was aligned more towards finding a solution for the longitude problem in the realms of astronomy. “A good watch may serve to keep a reckoning at Sea for some days and to know the time of a celestial Observation; and for this end a good Jewel watch may suffice till a better sort of Watch can be found out. But when the Longitude at sea is once lost, it cannot be found again by any watch.”Newton died in 1727, and therefore did not live to see the predecessor of the modern day chronometers become a reality. At the same time another less known figure; a skilled watchmaker from Lincolnshire named John Harrison who was stimulated by the scientific and the monetary factors surrounding this riddle decided to find a solution of his own. Possessed with a brilliant mind he succeeded initially in creating a prototype and then further versions of perfect working models of the world’s first marine-chronometers thereby revolutionizing the ocean travels. His handmade sea-clocks - which are elaborate pieces of engineering marvels and still in display in working condition at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, England - gave the world the first reliable method for measuring the longitude.Dava Sobel records the background and each step of this pioneering invention in an easy to read form, by guiding the reader through a tumultuous story of the sheer determination and relentless pursuit for perfection from a self made man and the obstructions, unkempt promises and villainy he had to face from some of his jealous contemporaries. This concise and engaging chronicle of an innovative engineering deed covers a lot of details on the history, science and politics, which led to this invention and is a recommended read for anyone who is interested in maritime history and science. Since I read an updated fully illustrated edition of ‘Longitude’, which was published later, the book was a treasure trove with a large selection of rare photographs - including Harrison's sea-clocks, documents of declarations, letters, scientific articles, maps and diagrams which added greatly to the value of the volume. The illustrated edition is highly recommended."
4803,The Log from the Sea of Cortez,John Steinbeck,3.83,3414,292,Joe Valdez,4,"On March 11, 1940, John Steinbeck and his good friend, the marine biologist Ed Ricketts (who served as Steinbeck's inspiration for the character of ""Doc"" in Cannery Row and Sweet Thursday) cast off from Monterey Bay with a chartered crew of four aboard a 75-foot purse seiner christened the Western Flyer. Their makeshift expedition made way for the Gulf of California. Or, as the narration goes, ""Once it was called the Sea of Cortez, and that is a better-sounding and a more exciting name. We stopped in many little harbors and near barren coasts to collect and preserve the marine invetrebraes of the littoral.""The expedition concluded on April 20, 1940 and the following year, Sea of Cortez: A Leisurely Journal of Travel and Research was published on the heels of Steinbeck's Pulitzer Prize winning novel The Grapes of Wrath. The book consisted of Ricketts' log, based on notes he took on the voyage and that Steinbeck edited, as well as an appendix that Ricketts compiled with photographs and drawings of specimens. Ricketts would be killed in 1948 three days after a passenger train struck his car in Monterey. To honor his friend's memory, Steinbeck republished the book as The Log from the Sea of Cortez in 1951, removing the appendix and adding a preface dedicated to his friend.If Ricketts or Steinbeck only published Sea of Cortez, they'd have contributed more to marine biology, geography and the humanities than most. As recently as 1940, the Gulf of California had been documented with only varying degrees of accuracy; the work of an 18th century Jesuit priest named Clavigero rates higher in Ricketts' esteem than the Coast Pilot, the maritime guidebook he begrudges for its ""austere tone."" There was no sonar, no satellite imagery. Photographic records were poor. Communication along Lower California was primitive. Ricketts and Steinbeck sailed one of the most dangerous bodies of water in the world for a month (albeit the month of calmest seas) with less technology than I'm using to write this book review. Though my mother might get a dizzy spell to see me admit this (she's a retired science teacher), the scientific passages of the book were ones that my eyes tended to glaze over. Crustaceans and other invetrebraes are simply not fascinating subject matter for me to read about. They may be for you. The marine biology portions of the book are far from dense or jargon-filled and do have a pleasant knack for appealing to the ten-year-old explorer in all of us. Many of the classifications simply started to pass by my eyes like something Willy Wonka would make up during a tour of the Chocolate Factory. We found extremely large sponges, a yellow form (probably Cliona), superficially resembling the Monterey Lissodendoryx noxiosa, and a white one, Steletta, of the wicked spines. There were brilliant-orange nudibranchs, giant terebellid worms, some shell-less air-breathing (pulmonate) snails, a ribbon-worm, and a number of solitary corals. These were common animals and the ones in which we were most interested, for while we took rarities when we came upon them in normal observation, our interest lay in the large groups and their associations--the word ""association"" implying a biological assemblage, all the animals in a given habitat.Initially, the boats that Ricketts and Steinbeck attempt to charter in Monterey Bay are owned by Italian, Slav or Japanese sardine fishermen uneasy about anything not related to fishing. The Western Flyer proves game. Her captain, Tony Berry, is intelligent and tolerant. ""He was willing to let us do any crazy thing we wanted so long as we (1) paid a fair price, (2) told him where to go, (3) did not insist that he endanger the boat, (4) got back on time, and (5) didn't mix him up in our nonsense."" The rest of the crew consists of ""Tex"" Travis, the engineer, who demonstrates an aversion to sharing dish washing duties, and two able seamen, ""Sparky"" Enea and ""Tiny"" Colletto, who ""grew up together in Monterey and they were bad little boys and very happy about it.""The highlights of Sea of Cortez for me were Ricketts' picturesque accounts of his experiences in the Gulf, which transported me to that place and time. I was reminded of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness in the sense that the further the boat travels, the further back in time it seems to travel. In ports of call like Cape San Lucas, the Western Flyer is welcomed with pomp by authorities as if the shrimper was the Queen Mary. In La Paz, little boys swarm the deck once word gets out that gringos are throwing away money on worthless sea creatures. In Puetro Escondido, a rancher invites the crew on a hunting trip with Indian guides in which no hunting takes place. In Loreto, a little boy takes them on a tour.This small boy could have been an ambassador to almost any country in the world. His straight-seeing dark eyes were courteous, yet firm. He was kind and dignified. He told us something of Loreto; of its poverty, and how its church was tumbled down now; and he walked with us to the destroyed mission. The roof had fallen in and the main body of the church was a mass of rubble. From the walls hung the shreds of old paintings. But the bell-tower was intact, and we wormed our way deviously up to look at the old bells and to strike them softly with the palms of our hands so that they glowed a little with tone.I can imagine that the only thing grander than Ricketts and Steinbeck exploring the Sea of Cortez for a month was editing Sea of Cortez. Even though Steinbeck refused to take any credit whatsoever for the log, I was able to connect this book with the travelogue Steinbeck wrote twenty years later, Travels with Charley: In Search of America. While that book was about a successful author trying to rediscover the country he'd been writing about from the comfort of his home in Long Island and autumnal in tone, Sea of Cortez is full of spring's youthful vigor, of living in the present, exploring the flora and fauna of Old Mexico with your best friend and other men.My list of John Steinbeck books ranked from favorite to least favorite:1. East of Eden (1952)2. The Grapes of Wrath (1939)3. Sweet Thursday (1954)4. Of Mice and Men (1937)5. The Wayward Bus (1947)6. Tortilla Flat (1935)7. The Winter of Our Discontent (1961)8. Cannery Row (1945)9. Sea of Cortez: A Leisurely Journal of Travel and Research (1941)10. Travels with Charley: In Search of America (1962)11. The Pastures of Heaven (1932)"

At the same time another less known figure; a skilled watchmaker from Lincolnshire named John Harrison who was stimulated by the scientific and the monetary factors surrounding this riddle decided to find a solution of his own. Possessed with a brilliant mind he succeeded initially in creating a prototype and then further versions of perfect working models of the world’s first marine-chronometers thereby revolutionizing the ocean travels. His handmade sea-clocks - which are elaborate pieces of engineering marvels and still in display in working condition at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, England - gave the world the first reliable method for measuring the longitude.Dava Sobel records the background and each step of this pioneering invention in an easy to read form, by guiding the reader through a tumultuous story of the sheer determination and relentless pursuit for perfection from a self made man and the obstructions, unkempt promises and villainy he had to face from some of his jealous contemporaries. This concise and engaging chronicle of an innovative engineering deed covers a lot of details on the history, science and politics, which led to this invention and is a recommended read for anyone who is interested in maritime history and science. Since I read an updated fully illustrated edition of ‘Longitude’, which was published later, the book was a treasure trove with a large selection of rare photographs - including Harrison's sea-clocks, documents of declarations, letters, scientific articles, maps and diagrams which added greatly to the value of the volume. The illustrated edition is highly recommended."
464,Collected Poems,Paul Auster,3.59,214,17,M. Sarki,3,"Paul Auster is a very talented man. His poems are well-made and he should be very proud of them. Auster says himself (and is quoted in the introduction) that these artifacts may be seen down the road as his very best work. I was not so enamored with his translations, but I don't think it had anything to do at all with the work Auster did on them. It was important for me to read these poems and I am more impressed with Auster than before. It has enabled a clearer understanding I would not have had otherwise. I don't know of many writers who successfully write poetry, fiction, and essays as well as Auster does. Hard to do all these well. Generally we need to stick with what works best, but Auster is proof that sometimes we just don't know. Glad he had the courage to try other things than poetry. We are all better for it. I really cannot tell you what any of his poems mean, but there is something about them that stays with you, which is good enough for me."
472,Why Write?,Paul Auster,3.75,121,12,Jason,5,"There is an essay at the end of Joy Williams' book 'Ill Nature' that I believe is called 'Why I Write'. Some of these short essays in Paul Auster's 'Why Write' remind me of that Joy Williams' piece. Both are well worth the read.While there is a place for books like Strunk and White in the writer's arsenal, it's important to remember that the writer isn't born in these grammatical wastelands. The writer is a vessel waiting to be bled of its story. The writer is floating in the ether and drawn forth by a calling, a crying, a dance. Essays by passionate writers such as Williams and Auster remind us that whether it be to fulfill civic duty, appease hungry ghosts, or crawl your way through what cannot otherwise be defined, the writing process is both a cross to bear and a blessing to behold.Auster explains how he became a writer by telling a story that ends with ""..if there's a pencil in your pocket, there's a good chance that one day you'll feel tempted to start using it.""What's in your pocket?"
3594,"The Execution of Sherlock Holmes: And Other New Adventures of the Great Detective (Sherlock Holmes, #3)",Donald Thomas,3.75,356,49,Sanjay Gautam,3,"A viper bit Milverton- what was his plight?The viper, not Milverton, died of the bite. Execution of Sherlock Holmes is a collection of five not-so short stories. In my opinion out of the five stories here only three are very good: they keep you guessing and maintain the thrill throughout; and the rest two are not bad and can be enjoyed. What makes this pastiche of Holmes different: We are shown the non-super human side of our beloved sleuth. By 'non-super human' I mean 'ordinary'. (But mind you that ordinary-ness of Sherlock Holmes is way above than our standards of ordinary-ness). In the first story itself we are shown the other side of Holmes, which we'd never seen, where Holmes struggles for his life and tries to save himself from his blood thirsty enemies. In all these stories there is one more thing different about Holmes is that we actually see what Holmes is doing to catch his prey or saving his client - unlike the originals where we do not exactly know everything what Holmes is doing (just like JOKER from The Dark Knight). All in all, this book shows Sherlock Holmes from a different perspective: which can have its admirers, and critics.1). The execution of Sherlock Holmes: 3.8/5.0  It is the first of the five stories, and is the title of the book. It was 90 pages long. The title says very much about the story. Sherlock Holmes is kidnapped and is kept as a prisoner by his blood thirsty enemies. He is given a trial at their court; and is sentenced to be hanged till death. The main focus is: how Holmes escape from the captivity of his enemies. Overall the jailbreak part was fascinating and thrilling. 2). The Case of the Greek Key: 2.8/5.0 It is the second story. This story is all about cryptography, and code breaking. People at Admiralty intercepts some secret information being passed to German Navy using Morse code. And soon it is clear that there is a spy in Admiralty who is helping in sending the highly sensitive information to Germans; but it is the encrypted information they are not able to retrieve- they cannot break the code. After two months of futile efforts, at last, the Admiral (Fischer from Naval Treaty) approaches Sherlock Holmes. The premise of the story was very interesting, but I didn't liked this story much. I felt it a bit dry and, for me, it was a just an average read. It lacks that awe inspiring genius of Sir Doyle. The last story Execution of Holmes was better than this one.3). The Case of Peasenhall Murder : 2.5/5.0...I really don't remember much of the story but I'm pretty sure that Holmes never catches the real culprit.4). The Case of the Phantom Chambermaid: 3.6/5.0I was taken by surprise on finding this story to be interesting, satisfying and well executed. It all starts with a very ordinary case which ultimately culminates into something really extraordinary and ends with descent, if not great, climax. I enjoyed this story very much. 5).  The Queen of the Night: 3.8/5.0This story was woven in a very different style than previous four stories. This last story was connected with the first story 'Execution of Sherlock Holmes', and the thread was Col. Moriarty and a priceless diamond. The story moved quite straight forwardly but always keeping the reader guessing and not revealing much. The climax could've been a bit more revealing and detailed but it end a little too prematurely. But it was interesting read."
3595,The Mysteries of Sherlock Holmes (Illustrated Junior Library),Arthur Conan Doyle,4.32,115,8,Yoomin Kim,4,"This book is about the way of Sherlock Holmes(consulting detective), and his friend, John Watson(helper) solving 9 cases that client request to them. I chose this book, because I really enjoy to watch Sherlock as a drama and suddenly this book was just there so I tried to reading it. When I finished chapters through and through, I was really feeling that the author, Conan Doyle is a genius. Sherlock was solving 9cases in his own way. Like if I am try to solve one of the case in the book, solving and reasoning why it is will impossible me to explain, but Sherlock was looking things and remembering all things and finally solved it in his way. I especially liked a case of identity in this book. It was showing Sherlock's strength in a short one chapter!"
3592,The Fall of the Amazing Zalindas  (Sherlock Holmes and the Baker Street Irregulars #1),Tracy Mack,3.8,854,118,Margaret,5,"A well written series for ages 9-12 that will never be appreciated by that age group.For one thing, the language is more complicated than the popular Wimpy Kid, Dork Diaries and Middle School series. Another thing, there's a lot more depth involved here. And the other thing is, the first couple of chapters start out a little slow, whereas you learn more about the characters that make up ""The Baker Street Irregulars"". When compared with the more popular series I mentioned, I'm not sure if it can hold the interest long enough for the kid to get truly involved in the story. I think it's a shame because not only is there so much more depth in this series of only three books. It's also a history lesson as well as a good way for a kid to ""cut his/her teeth"" on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, especially if one is concerned about their kid reading about Holmes' drug habit at too young of an age. (I'm happy to report that isn't in there at all.) The last book in this series was published four years ago, so I'm not hopeful that this one will continue. But at least there are three truly great books. There are even translations in the back for the slang used in the book, as well as descriptions for the different types of carriages that were referred to in the story."
4451,People of the Lie: The Hope for Healing Human Evil,M. Scott Peck,3.96,5799,424,Joanna,4,"""Evil can be conquered only by love."" ""To somehow be tolerant and intolerant."" ""An almost Godlike compassion is required.""--------""Okay George, I'm going to say a few things to you and I want you to listen to them well. Because they are very important. Nothing is more important.""""You have a defect--a weakness--in your character, George. It is a very basic weakness, and it it the cause of all the difficulties we've been talking about. It's the major cause of your bad marriage. It's the cause of your symptoms, your obsessions and compulsions."" ""Basically George, you are a kind of coward. Whenever the going gets a little bit rough, you sell out. When you're faced with the realization that your're going to die one of these days, you run away from it. You don't think about it, because it's 'morbid.' When you're faced with the painful realization that your marriage is lousy, you run away from that too. Instead of facing it and doing something about it, you don't think about that either. And then because your've run away from these things that are really inescapable, they come to haunt you in these form of your symptoms, your obsessions, and compulsions These symptoms could be your salvation, You could say, ""These symptoms mean that I'm haunted. I better find out what these ghosts are, and clean them out of my house.' But you don't say that, because that would mean really facing some things that are painful.. So you try to run away from your symptoms, too. Instead of facing them and what they mean, you try to get rid of them. And when they're not so easy to get rid of, you go running to anything that will give you relief no matter how wicked or evil or destructive. You plead you shouldn't be accountable... because it was [done] under duress. Of course it was [done] under duress. Why else would one do that, except to rid oneself of some kind of suffering?... The question is not duress. The question is how people deal with duress. Some withstand it and overcome it, ennobled. Some break and sell out. You sell out, and I must say, you do it rather easily. Easily. Easy. That's a key word for you, George. You like to think of yourself as easygoing. Joe Cool. And I suppose you are easygoing, but I don't know where you're going easy, except into hell. You're always looking for the easy way out, George. Not the right way. The easy way. Where you're faced with a choice between the right way and the easy way, you'll take the easy way every time. The painless way. In fact, you'll do anything to find the easy way out, even it if means selling your soul.As I said, I'm glad you're feeling guilty. If you didn't feel bad about taking the easy way out, no matter what, then I wouldn't be able to help you... If you're willing to face the painful realities of your life--your terrorful childhood, your miserable marriage, your mortality, your own cowardice--I can be of some assistance. And I am sure that we will succeed. But if all you want is the easiest possible relief form pain, then I expect you are the devil's man, and I don't see any way to help you. ""--------""The feeling that a healthy person often experiences in a relationship with an evil one is revulsion. The feeling of revulsion may be almost instant if the evil encountered is blatant. If the evil is more subtle, the revulsion may develop only gradually as the relationship with the evil one slowly deepens. The feeling of revulsion can be extremely useful to the therapist. It can be a diagnostic tool par excellence. It can signify more truly and rapidly than anything else that the therapist is in the presence of an evil human being."" ""Revulsion is a powerful emotion that causes us to immediately want to avoid, to escape, the revolting presence, And that is exactly the most appropriate thing for a healthy person to do under ordinary circumstances when confronted with an evil presence: to get away from it. Evil is revolting because it is dangerous. It will contaminate or otherwise destroy a person who remains too long in its presence. Unless you know very well what you are doing, the best thing you can do when faced with evil is to run the other way. The revulsion counter-transference is an instinctive or if you will, a God-given and saving early-warning radar system."" p65""There is another reaction that the evil frequently engender in us: confusion. Describing an encounter with an evil person, one woman wrote, it was ""as if I'd suddenly lost my ability to think."" Once again, this reaction is quite appropriate. Lies confuse. The evil are ""people of the lie"" deceiving others as they also build layer upon layer of self-deception. """"While evil people are to be feared, they are also to be pitied.""""It is a thesis of this book that evil can be defined as a specific form of mental illness...""""It is not their sins per se that characterize evil people, rather is is the subtlety and persistence and consistency of their sins. This is because the central defect of the evil is not the sin but the refusal to acknowledge it.""""The words ""image,"" ""appearance,"" and ""outwardly"" are crucial to understanding the morality of evil. While they seem to lack any motivation to BE good, they intensely desire to appear good. Their ""goodness"" is all on a level of pretense. It is, in effect, a lie. This is why they are, the ""people of the lie."" ""Actually, the lie is designed not so much to deceive others as to deceive themselves. They cannot or will not tolerate the pain of self-reproach...Because they are such experts at disguise, it is seldom possible to pinpoint the maliciousness of the evil. The disguise is usually impenetrable. """"It is my experience that evil seems to run in families."" (80)""There is, I suspect, something basically incomprehensible about evil. But if not incomprehensible, it is characteristically inscrutable. The evil always hide their motives with lies.""""If one wants to seek out evil people, the simplest way to do so is to trace them from their victims. The best place to look, then, is among the parents of emotionally disturbed children or adolescents. I do not mean to imply that all emotionally disturbed children are victims of evil or that all such parents are malignant persons. The configuration of evil is present only in a minority of these cases. It is, however, a substantial minority.""""Evil was defined as the use of power to destroy the spiritual growth of others for the purpose of defending and preserving the integrity of our own sick selves.""(199)It may be that the parents described were not themselves suffering, but their families were. And the symptoms of family disorder--depression, suicide, failing grades, --were attributed to the leadership. The suffering of the children was a symptom of the sickness of the parents.""""The relationship between evil and schizophrenia is not only a matter for fascinating speculation but also very serious research. Many (but certainly not all) of the parents of schizophrenic children seem to be ambulatory schizophrenics or evil or both."" ""Wherever there is evil, there is a lie around."" (135)""Theirs is a brand of narcissism so total that they seem to lack, in whole or party, this capacity for empathy.""---------"
8336,"Farmer Boy Days (Little House Chapter Books: Laura, #6)",Laura Ingalls Wilder,4.16,379,34,Sarah Bruno,3,This was a fantastic nonfiction book that made me want to read more of Laura Ingalls Wilder novels. This story in particular is about Laura's husband Almanzo Wilder and his life as a boy living in the countryside of New York. Almanzo’s family is a very wealthy family owning a huge barn and working as smart farmers. Each year brings a new season and each season brings a hard task that Almanzo and his two sisters and brother work to fulfill the seasons crops. One strength about this book is that its very cool comparing the life of a girl in the late 1800s (Laura Ingalls Wilder)to the life of a boy(Almanzo Wilder)as the work as farmers in opposite sides of the country. Almanzo’s family owning huge barns and living in a huge house made me think how less fortunate Laura's family was having to move everywhere there dad leaving to find work. To me thats kind of funny that they ended up with each other living two different lives. To conclude I think that this is an excellent book.

7713,Selected Plays of George Bernard Shaw,George Bernard Shaw,3.93,27,2,Dr.J.G.,4,"Mrs. Warren 19s Profession:- Age old dilemma of society - ""respectable""vs. the other side, and the need of one for the other. It must have of course been extremely controversial when it was written - and published - but this writer was always more than equal to any criticism and could always argue either side of a debate with reason.This one is not a comedy, though, and one is presented with Mrs. Warren's side quite reasonably. Wednesday, September 10, 2008. ........................................................................................ ......................................................................................... Arms and the Man:- What seems obvious might after all not be so, and those that are seemingly snobbish and haughty might be not as affluent after all as those that seem casual or even comic. those that speak of love and are rewarded for their bravery might have never experienced either.And then there is Switzerland, the beautiful land with snow and meadows and chocolate and cheese, and contradictions - a country that never fought a war in recent history but has always hired out mercenaries to every nation. September 10, 2008. ........................................................................................ ......................................................................................... Pygmalion:- This is the original play that the very famous and popular ""My fair Lady"" is based on, except that was more of a sweet version, and this retains the original English, perhaps British or even Irish, taste - not sweet, not sour, not bitter or hot, but a little salt and some of that sixth taste that is called ""kasaila"" or ""kashaaya"" which means tea in the old medicinal sense. Here at the end there is a very well written epilogue that explains why the professor does not propose to any woman or have any romantic affair with any woman (and certainly with no man either) - not as a sickness on his part, but as a matter of evolution, and he is very evolved indeed. Unlike US of today the social norms of Britain then were quite different and sex was not a compulsory activity to prove one was normal, and for that matter normal was never defined as average, either. So eccentricity was not only allowed it positively thrived and flourished, and benefited the society enormously. Men like the professor could devote their time and energy to their preferred pursuits. He does end up baffled and quite unable to escape Elizabeth Dolittle though. Friday, July 9, 2010. ........................................................................................ ......................................................................................... Major Barbara:- A delightful look at various prevalent notions and hypocrisies of the times - and realities as they are. Salvation Army, church, politics as a career, ethics of business; niceties of law that might make one illegitimate in UK or at least in England but not in Australia, much less anywhere else in the world; and inheritance vs competence, when it is about running a business.US, particularly NRA of US (as in gun lobby) seem to have adopted the creed of one of the characters in this to an extent that poor Mr. Shaw could never have imagined - ""seem to"" being the key here. But on the other hand, who knows, he would perhaps have said that neither NRA of US nor he were wrong, and that any society that allows such happenings without curbing them with laws that made sense and protected children perhaps deserved the grief they allowed the arms manufacturers and dealers to let loose on them. And really US has much that is legal in US but illegal in Europe in many countries, or at least those that matter. Germany for example has outlawed any organisations or pictures to do with their past horror - but not US where those proliferate; so guns too, and the consequent stupidity of innocent persons and your own children massacred in their own homes and schools.Gun lobby of US - and much else of the world - might claim they follow this very intelligent writer for ethics, but if you look at it with a scrutiny, actually, no they don't; they are doing precisely what the writer cautions against, that is, mixing politics and business - for example in deciding who they will or will not sell to (or allow to carry arms), whether on personal level in the country (men get license easily, women don't, even though they are far more in need of self defence, whether from personal attackers or home robbers and so on), or on global level about nations and gangs (here there is no need of examples - they are far too obvious, well known), therefore making it a mess - or at least helping politics do so.That said, this is of course an extremely intelligent play as almost everything written by this writer is; this one deals with an arms dealer and the possible social embarrassment his family with aristocratic connections must go through - his son requires that the father help him without allowing it to be known, since he needs to have a social status - and various issues around the question, morality vs. arms manufacturer. Saturday, July 10, 2010. ........................................................................................ ......................................................................................... Man and Superman:- The idea had been around for a while, in various - genuine, not cartoon - forms, one supposes. At any rate various people developed it according to their best capacities of conception and perception. And it was a natural idea, after all. When one looks at evolution, it is only natural to expect that it might not be yet finished, and there might be higher rungs. If one thinks of creation, why suppose it is over? Who are humans to dictate that Divine can appear only once or is finished with Creation?George Bernard Shaw goes here into a hilarious look at things as they are and then into what might, what magnanimity they can achieve at the next stage; at life force that dictates people marry and reproduce, albeit calling it romance and love; at limitations of best and sharpest intellect when faced with life force; and in an inspired act, at concepts of heaven and hell as they really should be seen, rather than the silly prevailing ones.Truly delightful, one of the most hilariously delightful works of Shaw, and that is saying a lot. It leads you to think deep within while you are too busy laughing to notice it. Monday, September 22, 2008. ........................................................................................ ......................................................................................... Caesar and Cleopatra:- Here is a fresh look at Cleopatra as the young girl she must have been, compared to the much older Caesar - and while it is delightful in seeing a petulant young pretty girl getting her education rather expensively, through life and war, it is also a scathing commentary on various issues around war and morality and dealing with enemy, with Caesar above his fellow men - and women - providing them insight about why it was wrong what they did wrong.Most delightful remains the prologue, a monologue by the Egyptian god Ra, addressing the audience disdainfully.A sample - ""O you compulsorily educated people!""

3534,First Love and the Diary of a Superfluous Man,Ivan Turgenev,3.99,117,11,Callie,4,"Just recently I went to a lecture on Turgenev in which the lecturer discussed nihilism in his work. She also mentioned that he coined the term 'superfluous man'. These two short stories are in some ways quite similar and what I find I like best about Turgenev is his insight into human nature and the characters he creates--I think this is what makes his work so fresh even more than a hundred years after its publication. I found myself underlining bits that felt so true to me--thinking, 'I know someone like that!' or 'I've felt the same way!' Isn't this what we look for in literature--that moment of recognition? I also like to read about love when it's been written many years ago as opposed to contemporary love stories. Not sure why."

I would advise anyone to read it.It does, however, contain some offensive throwbacks to the mid-twentieth century, when it was written, back when we were all the same, I guess. It's sexist -- all alcoholics are men, it seems, to the dismay of their wives. It's heterosexist (Oh, wait. That's not a throwback.).Anyway, like the Bible and presumably many sacred texts, you have to ignore the bad in order to receive the good.Just. Like. Drugs.Just kidding."
7714,Pygmalion,George Bernard Shaw,3.9,76151,1693,Brina,5,"Reposting in honor of George Bernard Shaw's birthday, July 26. I am writing this review to honor my grandmother who recently passed away. I lost track of the number of times we listened to the soundtrack of My Fair Lady either in her car, her apartment, or my house growing up. To me Eliza Doolittle, Henry Higgins, and Colonel Pickering are as much the actors who played them as they are are the memories I created with my grandmother and great aunt while watching the movie or listening to its timeless songs. By the time I finally read Pygmalion in script form in eighth grade English class and then subsequently watched the movie in class, I had the entire script memorized. My entire class asked me for assistance in all the assignments associated with this unit, and of course, I demurred. Ask me today, I still have most of the songs memorized, which of course came from Shaw's brilliant script. My daughters' favorite classic film is My Fair Lady because of the gorgeous costumes they see at Ascot race track and the Royal ball. But what makes this Cinderella story timeless is not the costumes but the prose down to the last line, ""Eliza, where the devil are my slippers."" For those who have not read this tale or seen the film, take the time to do so. You too could be captivated by Eliza the flower girl turned language pupil and create generations of memories."

9866,Los Versos Satánicos,Salman Rushdie,3.71,43459,3099,Petra Eggs,1,"I never got past page 60 in this book. I read and forgot and reread and forgot again up unto about the fifth reading when I thought to myself that I might rate Midnight's Children as one of the greatest books I've read, enjoyed the depiction of Benazir Bhutto as the Virgin Ironpants in Shame a great deal, but I also couldn't read Shalimar the Clown and thought that Grimus was excreble (not even Rushie rated this first offering of his oeuvre). So what was I doing trying so hard with the Satanic Verses? I felt that for a book to engender such a farrago of praise, death and destruction I must read it for myself and see what it was all about. But I couldn't. It bored me rigid.However from the synopsis and reviews I have read of the book, I think it might translate into an excellent film, I just don't think there is a director alive courageous enough to make it, nor a cast who would act in it, and I don't blame any of them. But I do hate that the fundamentalists have got even that much of a victory.Death to all those that oppose *freedom! Well not death, nah, not that, just shut up already and go and moan to your friends and family like everyone else would.(view spoiler)[*One man's freedom is another man's murder; this is a word that changes its meaning according to the philosophy of those spouting it.

1059,Shibumi,Trevanian,4.22,9960,669,Jeffrey Keeten,4,"The reading public back in 1979 picked this book up thinking they were reading a best selling thriller novel, little did they know they were going to be exposed to a Trevanian philosophy called SHIBUMI. “SHIBUMI has to do with great refinement underlying commonplace appearances. It is a statement so correct that it does not have to be bold, so poignant it does not have to be pretty, so true it does not have to be real. SHIBUMI is understanding, rather than knowledge. Eloquent silence. In demeanor, it is modesty without prudency. In art, where the spirit of SHIBUMI takes the form of SABI, it is elegant simplicity, articulate brevity. In philosophy, where SHIBUMI emerges as WABI, it is spiritual tranquility that is not passive; it is being without the angst of becoming. And in the personality of a man, it is…authority without domination. One does not achieve SHIBUMI, one…discovers it. And only a few men of infinite refinement ever do that. One must pass through knowledge and arrive at simplicity to arrive at SHIBUMI.”I've seen reviewers say that this book is too intelligently written to be published today. A bit cynical in my opinion, the book is a product of the time, but certainly doesn't come across as a typical written by-the-numbers thriller. Written today it would obviously be written differently. Probably some of the more defining aspects of the book would be lost, but I still think this book would make the spring list of a major publisher. The first part is about Nicholai Hei's upbringing in Shanghai and Tokyo. He was born to an exiled Russian countess and a German soldier. His mother does whatever she needs to do to survive as territory changes hands and new armies march into town. Luckily for Hei his mom has the good fortune to snag a Japanese General, Kishikawa,who takes a shine to the boy. He arranges for Nicholai to be sent back to friends who can further his teachings in the Japanese philosophy game of GO. Nicholai has a natural ear for languages and learns five. As the world destabilizes and the Americans and the Russians start competing for trophies, Nicholai finds himself without a country. His one asset is his knowledge of languages. He takes a job working for the Americans even though he loathes them. The book is filled with pointed criticisms of all nationalities, but Trevanian's favorite target is the Americans.  ""It was not their irritating assumption of equality that annoyed Nicholai so much as their cultural confusions. The Americans seemed to confuse standard of living with quality of life, equal opportunity with institutionalized mediocrity, bravery with courage, machismo with manhood, liberty with freedom, wordiness with articulation, fun with pleasure – in short, all of the misconceptions common to those who assume that justice implies equality for all, rather than equality for equals.""Hei commits an act that brings him under the control of the CIA. The accusations that are thrown at him reminded me of 2008 when then Senator Obama was running for President and people were holding up signs with a Hitler mustache under his nose and accusing him of being a Stalinist. I kind of felt they needed to pick whether he was a Nazi or a Communist. It is really hard to be both. ""If I understand you, Major-and frankly I don't much care if I do-you are accusing me of being both a communist and a Nazi, of being both a close friend of General Kishikawa's and his hired assassin of being both a Japanese militarist and a Soviet spy. None of this offends your sense of rational probability?""Hei is subjected to devastating torture while in the hands of the Americans and this treatment sets him on his course of being an international assassin for hire and a level four master of sexual intercourse. Yes, in this novel there are four levels of sexual aptitude and I am not going to speculate as to where I fall on the spectrum. The first part of the novel is really good, but I really liked the second part because we get to meet Hei's friends. We find Nicholai living in a chateau in the Basque region of France.   His best friend is Beñat Le Cagot a self made man, a Basque poet who has an ego larger than Donald Trump only expressed with much more intelligence. He is randy, fun loving, and a spelunking companion for Hei. He likes expressing himself with colorful language such as ""By the Two Damp Balls of John the Baptist.""A typical conversation Hei always has to endure Le Cagotisms. ""Is everything laid out?""Does the devil hate the wafer?""""Have you tested the Brunton compass?""""Do babies shit yellow?""And you're sure there's no iron in the rock?""""Did Moses start forest fires?""""And the fluorescein is packed up?""""Is Franco an asshole?""Hei takes this all in stride, but I found myself snorting out loud several times at the Le Cagot wit. Trevanian must have had a giggle or two coming up with some of the Le Cagot expressions. Needless to say Hei becomes enmeshed with a situation counter to American interests. He enlists the aid of his other friend ""The Gnome"" a dwarf (Peter Dinklage?) and a world class blackmailer who has the means to bring governments to their knees. Body counts rise quickly, and in the course of his chess match with the Americans he realizes he has much more to lose than his life philosophy would ever have him admit. The book is at times over the top, spoofish, but the real brilliance of the book is the ability to read it on whatever level you want. If you want to take it to the beach as a mind diverting entertainment it will deliver. If you want to read it and let your mind toss around the aspects of the philosophy of Shibumi that is also quite easily done. Either approach to the book will garner enjoyment. Highly recommended and if I write much more I'm going to convince myself to bump it from four to five stars. I want to leave you with a summary of Hei's view of American culture. ""It's not Americans I find annoying; it's Americanism: a social disease of the postindustrial world that must inevitably infect each of the mercantile nations in turn, and is called 'American' only because your nation is the most advanced case of the malady, much as one speaks of Spanish flu, or Japanese Type-B encephalitis. It's symptoms are a loss of work ethic, a shrinking of inner resources, and a constant need for external stimulation, followed by spiritual decay and moral narcosis. You can recognize the victim by his constant efforts to get in touch with himself, to believe his spiritual feebleness is an interesting psychological warp, to construe his fleeing from responsibility as evidence that he and his life are uniquely open to new experiences. In the later stages, the sufferer is reduced to seeking that most trivial of human activities: fun."" "
3457,A Brief History of the End of the World: Apocalyptic Beliefs from Revelation to UFO Cults,Simon Pearson,3.5,30,10,Lisa,4,"I really enjoyed this book. The introduction gave me some misgivings because it was so general, but as soon as I got into the first chapter (""The Origins of Apocalyptic Faith"") I was learning something new on every page. Pearson traces apocalyptic belief from Zoroastrianism to Judaism to Christianity to Islam. His focus on the Abrahamic religions, especially Christianity, in the Middle East, Europe, and the Unite States means that you don't hear much about other religions' ideas on the end of the world, and can even leave you with the impression that apocalyptic ideas are more or less completely unique to Abrahamic religions. That shortcoming aside, this book really helped me better understand the Book of Revelation, the Book of Daniel, and the legacy of both. For people who have never been able to get through either (like me), Pearson helpfully summarizes their events, authorship, and interpretation. Pearson's book is brimming with fascinating and grotesque stories about fringe apocalyptic communities, but the really important things I took away from it were a better understanding of how influential Abrahamic ideas of the end of the world have been, how mainstream apolcalyptic thought has been at various time periods and continues to be, and how consistently apocalypticism and racism, prejudice, and violence have supported one another in various ways and settings over thousands of years.It sounds a note of caution to me that Pearson doesn't appear to have written any other books, doesn't name the college he teaches at in London, and, judging by Amazon and Goodreads reviews, doesn't appear to be very well read. However, PBS has an incredible website on the apocalypse, and its series of articles on the topic seem to cover much of the same ground that Pearson does in his book (see http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontli... and click on ""apocalypticism"" for articles). (Note on edition: I somehow wound up with the British version of this book--titled ""A Brief History of the End of the World: From Revelation to Eco-Disaster"" instead of ""UFO Cults""--so for a while I was tripping over phrases like ""on sea"" and ""bog standard."" Otherwise, I think it probably corresponds to the American version listed here on Goodreads.)"
7907,"Heaven to Betsy (Betsy-Tacy, #5)",Maud Hart Lovelace,4.29,4899,192,Emilia P,3,"This book is just fine. But there's too much change! Ah!First of all, Betsy moves! And then, because of that...My main qualm is that there is way way way too much boy-stuff and not NEARLY enough Tacy. In fact, since Tacy isn't boy crazy she ends up on the periphery of pretty much all the goings on of freshman year. And in turn, I ended up resenting every other girl introduced in this book. In short: screw you, Bonnie and Carney. Give me back my Tacy. ASAP. Also, it was clear all along what a bad seed Tony was, and I was pretty furious with Betsy for falling for him. So yeah. Those are my gripes.At the same time, I thought it was a fascinating, accurate, and a throughly, surprisingly modern potrayal of coming of age. There are sleepovers, there are b'girl parties, there are boys walking girls home alone(!), ouija boards, , they all get around the piano and sing the same songs over and over (pre-radio, pre-MTV, but still, a teenage culture ruled by musical romanticism). There are lots of kissings on the cheek.Betsy screws up a lot and cries a little. In the end she realizes ""the crowd"" is for a time, but her writing is forever, and that she needs to concentrate on it harder. More power to you, Betsy.AND she and her sister decide they want to be Episcopalian instead of Baptist! And their dad says, well, ok. It's a really well written, tense, and realistic scene. And then he makes coffee, because that's what the Rays do when they're stressed.It all could have been so cheesy, but every feeling in this book rang so true. Man oh man, I know I'm giving it a three because I resented the Tacylessness, but I was super into it, clearly, and hope the quiet rift between Betsy and Tacy is addressed (sometimes best friends fight, yo) in a later book. Hill Street 4ever, yo."
3460,The World is Flat,Thomas L. Friedman,3.66,84663,3324,Daniel,1,"I tried to plow through this book, but Thomas Friedman is the most brain-dead parrot of the ruling class I have ever known, so I couldn't finish it.His view of globalization is that now, thanks to the paternalistic global order constructed by US multinational corporations, there is cultural and monetary things of worth out there in the vast unexplored jungles of savagery called ""not the United States."" As an ahistorical text that ignores the fact that elites have been trading from Occident to and from Orient for hundreds of years, the book ignores entirely the poor.How wonderful it is to be ruling class in this new era, where poor people from all over the world can service the rich like Friedman. What an asshole."
5558,iWoz,Steve Wozniak,3.82,10290,684,Jackie,1,"I gave up.Edit: To give this a bit more depth, let me explain. Steve Wozniak is a brilliant man, a kind man, a wonderful man. I'd love to have him as a friend, family member, coworker (I said the opposite of Jobs when reading his biography). He just simply cannot write. Every page reads like an excited little boy who just came home from school (And then I built this project. And then I pushed the ""on"" button. And the lights didn't work. But I learned a lot. And I tried a new project for the science fair.), which I believe Woz still is, at heart. That's fantastic. That's lovely. But it doesn't make for good writing.There is something to possibly be said about the fact that maybe Woz's life is a bit dull for this sort of thing. He had no issues with his childhood. He loved his parents. He's unblemished by his past. I'm telling you, he's an absolutely excellent guy, but such good-naturedness doesn't leave a lot of room for conflict.Then again, I also think there's tons that's interesting about Woz. But it would have been better left to an autobiographer to tell, someone who could emphasize the important parts, locate them in the spirit of the times, or at the very least draw out broader thoughts from his subject. This leads me to my second problem: although this book was published earlier, I read the Jobs autobiography first. That means that any of the exciting little stories embedded here (the early days of phone phreaking, the Home Brew Club, Apple's early days) I had already heard--and frequently in much more fascinating detail.So, no matter how many times I tried, I just couldn't finish this book. Sorry Woz! Let's be friends?"
5557,Les invasions: le second assaut contre l'Europe chrétienne (VIIe-XIe siècles),Lucien Musset,3.33,12,2,Michael Smith,3,"Though this work was originally published in 1965, the fact that new editions of the English translation are still being published shows that its usefulness is still recognized. The period of the “barbarian” invasions of the western Roman Empire can be confusing. There were many different cultures, of separate origins and speaking a variety of languages, their peregrinations often overlapping. Many of them joined together in alliances, broke apart again, and fought each other as well as the Romans and the Romanized barbarians who had arrived earlier. But most Americans of European origin are more likely to carry the DNA of the Visigoths, Vandals, Lombards, or Franks, than we are of the Romans.Musset divides his work into three parts, the first of which I would especially recommend to beginners in this subject. It’s called “The Facts” and it runs about 150 well-written, easily comprehended pages. Rather than considering each of the migrating peoples individually, because they so often interact with each other, he deals with the subject chronologically, examining each of the five major waves of invaders by land over four centuries, plus the maritime migrations of the Germanic Saxons, Angles, and Jutes to Britain.The second section is “Unsolved Problems and Subjects for Further Research,” which is still largely valid even after almost forty-five years. While new schools of historical thought and method have taken power, there are still many unanswered questions. In fact, this section could be very useful in getting students to think for themselves.The third section, “Sources and Studies,” is probably the least useful at this late date, being an unannotated bibliography of more than five hundred primary and secondary sources, both books and journal articles -- most of them, not surprisingly, in languages other than English. Still, the primary sources themselves haven’t changed (though interpretations of them have), and certain classic secondary works, like J. B. Bury, are certainly still worth reading."

5553,Six Easy Pieces: Essentials of Physics By Its Most Brilliant Teacher,Richard Feynman,4.19,13570,441,Tulpesh Patel,4,"There is not much more to be said about Richard Feynman’s impact on physics or science communication; the man is as bona-fide legend and as close to being a worshipable God as scientists can have. Six Easy Pieces is a collection of the ‘easiest’ six chapters from Richard Feynman’s most-celebrated text book The Feynman Lectures on Physics. The ‘easy’ in the title, is, like our sense of time, all relative. The lectures, delivered in the early 60’s, were aimed at “the most intelligent in the class [freshman and sophomore physics students at Caltech, one of the most prestigious institutions in the world] and to make sure, if possible, that even the most intelligent student was unable to encompass everything…” We, as the general reader, are more like the ‘secondary’ audience for the lectures, who for Feyman at the time were the students “for whom the extra fireworks are merely disquieting and who cannot be expected to learn the material in the lecture at all”. Such was Feynman’s power of exposition, however, you can follow the science, each chapter getting progressively more complicated and abstract, without ever feeling like you’re being left behind.The first three chapters, on Atoms in Motion, Basic Physics, and the Relation of Physics to Other Sciences, were so good I read them twice. Their broad remit means they touch on lots of different things, with one astonishing idea thrown in after the other. Mind-body dualism from a physicists perspective: “When an animal learns something, it can do something different than it could before, and its brain cells must have changed too, if it is made out of atoms. In what way is it different?”The final three chapters, on the Conservation of Energy, the Theory of Gravitation and Quantum behaviour are a little heavier, but no less interesting. There’s the occasional formula, which immediately starts the eyes glazing over, but, to the lay reader, they serve to remind you just how much of the book is mathematics translated into wonderful, approachable prose. I’ve read about things like Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle or the “double-slit” experiment, which showed that at the quantum level particles behave both waves and particles, many times before, but is actually the first time that I really *got it*. For that, I cannot recommend the book enough. For those looking for more pop-physics in a similar vein, I can really recommend Why Does E=MC2 by Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw, Quantum by Manjit Kumar and Black Holes, Worm Holes and Time Machines by Jim Al-Khalili. Having now read Six Easy Pieces, I can see the obvious influence of Feynman on the not just their content but their delivery and style.There are also three prefaces to the edition of the book I read. Paul Davies’ introduction and David Goldstein’s special preface set the backdrop to the book and the lectures. The most interesting preface is the one written by Feynman himself for the original edition, in which he talks about how he set about piecing the course together, who it was aimed at and why, and how ultimately he felt that he had let his students down in some way. It shows just how much thought he put into the lectures and just how much he cared about educating his students. In some way, as someone enjoys teaching and talking about science, I learnt a lot from these few pages as I did from the rest of the book. Its 50 years since The Feynman Lectures on Physics were published. Our understanding of the universe, and particularly quantum mechanics, has moved on in leaps and bounds but at no point did Six Easy Pieces feel like it was out of date because Feynman’s timeless ways of explaining complicated physics in uncomplicated ways."

7786,¡Horton escucha a quién!,Dr. Seuss,4.16,83718,1141,Alejandro,5," One of the best Dr. Seuss' stories ever!
  PRICELESS TALE

  I’ll just have to save him. Because, after all,

  A person’s a person, no matter how small,
Without a doubt, one of the crowned jewels of Dr. Seuss’ work, presenting one of his strongest messages to the human civilization.Horton, the elephant, appears again (he was introduced to the world in Horton Hatches the Egg), which is one of the most famous characters of Dr. Seuss.Horton hears a Who (as quite adequately indicates the tale’s title) in a speck of dust, but since he is the only one with big ears (an elephant, remember?) in the jungle, the rest of animals there think that Horton is lying about it, since nobody else is able to hear the feble voice of the Who.But it’s not just any Who, but the Who Mayor of Who-ville! A whole town, in a speck of dust.How wonderful indeed was the mind of Dr. Seuss!What a large quantity of stories he was able to take from a tiny speck of dust!Just imagine how many more stories are in the rest of millions of specks of dust!This charming tale stands up and becomes a relevant reading for everybody to understand the respect to any kind of life,......not matter how small."
6980,The Dance of the Dissident Daughter: A Woman's Journey from Christian Tradition to the Sacred Feminine (Plus),Sue Monk Kidd,3.94,5416,630,Jessica,1,"I found Sue Monk Kidd’s books The Mermaid Chair and The Secret Life of Bees mesmerizing and poetic. They were the type of books that you don’t want to put down, but you don’t want to end, especially, The Secret Life of Bees. It was for this reason; I thought I would love all of SMK’s books. However, I was saddened when I read The Dance of the Dissident Daughter. In the beginning, I enjoyed the book and could definitely relate to a lot of her experiences as a woman in this society and as a Christian woman. She talks about gender bias in society and in the church. It turns out that instead of embracing how strong a woman’s role is in the church; she rejects her role as a Christian woman completely and ventures off into her own creation, her very own religion. I kept hanging in there following her on her journey, hoping her faith and obedience to Christ would return. However, it didn’t. Reading this book took me for a spiritual rollercoaster ride. Like I said, I could definitely relate to a lot of the prejudice she has experienced as a woman in the church, but I was hoping she would provide some guidance on what a woman’s role should be in the church. I was hoping she would provide a solution, a way to intertwine Christianity and Feminism. Unfortunately, it turned out to be the blind leading the blind and instead of humility (which I have found is needed to gain any understanding and wisdom) the undertone of the book was pride. Of course, looking back I can see how her journey to the “Divine Feminine” was very present in the first two novels I read and mentioned above. Perhaps, that is why I enjoyed those books so much, because they really allow you to embrace your femininity and know how powerful and nurturing a woman’s love can be. However, I feel that as a woman these are gifts from God, by His grace alone, we are able to use these gifts for good. I feel though that we should humble ourselves and thank God for these gifts rather than worshipping these gifts. I know this is a very strong opinion, but I really feel like SMK has created her own idol(s). This has been done in the past with gifts God has given us: money, power, family… I think it has come to the point where she is worshipping her femininity, which is just one of the many gifts our Creator has blessed us women with. I must mention there were some very moving and beautiful parts of this book, too, because yes, being a woman is beautiful and yes, nature is wonderful and I feel at certain parts in the book she really celebrates womanhood and nature at its best. Yet, again I stress that women and nature are gifts from God and shouldn’t be worshipped as gods themselves. I do commend her for putting herself out there and sharing her spiritual journey, that takes a lot of courage, because you know, everyone is a critic. I love all of my sisters and I share their pain and I agree that womanhood should be celebrated. I know that whether SMK knows it right now or not; she will always be His, since nothing can snatch us from our Father’s hand. I just hope she will soon rediscover the joy in that—the joy in having such a loving, merciful, and graceful Father. I still have a long way to go on my spiritual journey and what is important to me is staying true to my convictions. I feel that SMK’s book was a major stumbling block for me, as a Christian woman and therefore I would not recommend this to any other Christian woman.Anyway, I am glad that shortly after reading this book, I read The Lies Woman Believe: And the Truth that Sets Them Free, and I feel that book gave me the guidance I was looking for all along. Also, listed in The Lies Woman Believe: And the Truth that Sets Them Free are other great resources for women."
2707,The Canterbury Tales,Geoffrey Chaucer,3.48,159734,2675,MJ Nicholls,4,"When confronted with the painful choice of whether or not to read Chaucer in the original Middle English, I agonised for precisely four seconds and decided to read Nevill Coghill’s modern translation in lovely Penguin paperback. In the same way I wouldn’t learn German to read Goethe, or unlearn English to read Dan Brown, I refuse to learn archaic forms of English for pointless swotty scholar-points, and grope instead for selfish readerly pleasure, two-fingering the purists and bunking down with Mr. Nevill for nights of sumptuous moral homily, proto-feminist romantic comedy, and high courtly drama. For Chaucer neophytes like me, this text captures the bouncy humour and devilish cleverness of the original (not that I would know!), and hopefully will turn a generation of frightened and unenlightened readers on to this master of verse. (And if you must know, my rhyming homage review was lost due to a power failure and a more tempting invitation to eat pilaf rice with Brian. Street children! Wives of Bath! Go forth and Chaucerize!)"
9792,A Walk in the Woods.,Lee Blessing,4.09,120,16,Nancy,3,"An interesting play. It is two negotiators for the Russian/American arms race. They really make you think about just what are they there for. Do the politicians really want peace and what would that mean in a treaty? Does an arms treaty really have any meaning when each side continually makes and researches new weapons? So they destroy thousands of obs9olete missiles. Does that really mean anything or is it all about saving face and power? Some serious points are brought up by the two negotiators as they take periodic walks in the Swiss woods over the months, even years, that they are negotiating. One finally retires when he no longer has any hope or fun from stalling. The other says he will stay on because he still is an idealist and has hope. This was produced back in 1988 and, sadly, you can see that nothing has changed. the writing in here is correct. Arms negotiations are just a façade to keep the populace happy. Not sure if that should make me angry, sad, or both."
9787,Men Who Hate Women and the Women Who Love Them: When Loving Hurts and You Don't Know Why,Susan Forward,4.06,1364,62,Beks,5,"Confronting but not hateful or angry. She writes from both her own experience and that of couples she has counselled, it EXPLAINS so much - and gently too. A lot of these books leave me feeling as though they are ""coming AT you"". Insighting rage and even more pain. They have a real man hating aspect to them. The compassion that this author writes with makes turning the pages a little less difficult - even though the topic is nothing short of awful.This book has been confronting as a mother - it has shown areas that I need to work on with my son. It has also shown me where and how I enabled my ex's behaviour, my responsibility in how I allowed this to happen, it also pointed out why it is so frightening for fathers to be this way, especially with their daughters.I'm still reading it. Because it is confronting on so many levels, I find I have to keep putting it down and coming back to it.It has been written with such respect for everyone involved that it allows me to still feel the love I had for the man I was with, without feeling anything more than sadness for everyone involved - no hatred or resentment, residue fear for his daughter - but there is little I can do about that for the time being. I intend to write the author and thank her, as a mother, a ""partner"" and as a woman so badly wounded byt this type of relationship - you cannot heal what you will not allow yourslef to admit to. This book helps you get there without hating yourself or leaving you neck deep in humiliation."

Unfortunately, I picked the wrong book. Years of declining the advice of the Bryson-worshipers, it seems, was not in vain.I'm halfway through, and - like the author on the daunting trail - am unsure as to whether or not I can finish my task. Bryson sounds, to put it mildly, a real jerk. He's smug and superior, and spends most of the book complaining about his companions on the trail. A common motif is how everyone one is but a weekend hiker, that he is a true back-to-nature type in comparison. True, some of his encounters sound less than thrilling, but even the obnoxious woman he encounters should get credit for tackling the trail by herself. Instead, she's unceremoniously ditched (in real life as well as print) by the man who couldn't stomach the thought of going alone. He enlists the companionship of a long-lost friend with whom he'd proven incompatible on a previous travel experience. Said ""friend"" is then derided throughout the book for his sloth, roughness in manner, and lowbrow tastes. Meanwhile, Bryson paints himself as Guardian of the Trail, criticising the Parks Service along with all who venture through her woods.I'm still waiting for even a glimpse of the much-vaunted Bryson wit and charm to show itself. At the moment, he's nothing more than the stereotypical Blue Stater - putting himself on a pedestal while looking down his nose at everyone else. It's not attractive, and it makes for a very frustrating read. I wish he'd stayed home."

9386,Free Play: Improvisation in Life and Art,Stephen Nachmanovitch,4.11,1422,111,Janet,5,"The right book at the right time saves lives. Man, you can say that about Free Play: Improvisation in Life and Art. The thing about play in art, is it's a sign of strength to spare, wind to spare, like someone running a marathon who breaks out into a pirouette. Sometimes working on a long project, the task just seems monstrous--like trying to build a gothic cathedral all by yourself. This book is a reminder, for a writer in long form, that it's not stone on stone, a heavy, exhausting thing. That play, like the free jazz that the violinist author Nachmanovitch loves, makes heavy work light. That there are other ways to solve problems, other ways to approach the page, and that improvisation, the lightness of it, the in-the-momentness of its playfulness, IS the 'air that falls through the net' that Neruda describes. ************************* Here's my favorite part so far-- on editing.  ""In producing large works… we are perforce taking the results of many inspirations and melding them together into a flowing structure that has its own integrity and endures through time…. We arrange them, cook them, render them down, digest them. We add, subtract, reframe, shift, break part, melt together. The play of revision and editing transforms the raw into the cooked. This is a whole art unto itself, of vision and revision, playing again with the half-baked products of our prior play. … ""Editing must come from the same inspired joy and abandon as free improvisation…. There is a stereotyped belief that the muse in us acts from inspiration, while the editor in us acts from reason and judgment. But if we leave our imp or improviser out of the process, re-vision becomes impossible. If I see the paragraph I wrote last month as mere words on a page, they become dead and so do I… ""Some elements of artistic editing: 1. deep feeling for the intentions beneath the surface; 2. sensual love of the language; 3. sense of elegance; and 4. ruthlessness. The first three can perhaps be summarized under the category of good taste, which involvers sensation, sense of balance and knowledge of the medium, leavened with an appropriate sense of outrageousness…."" I will definitely put Free Play on the shelf right next to The Art Spirit within arm's reach of my writing desk, to remind me about the air that falls through the net. I can't be reminded of it enough."

3214,Protágoras / Gorgias / Carta séptima,Plato,3.83,6,1,Raúl,5,"El presente volumen, publicado por Alianza Editorial, reúne dos importantes diálogos de Platón centrados en la crítica a los sofistas. Para completarlo, aunque rompa un poco la unidad temática, se añade la Carta séptima, de gran interés para conocer al autor de primera mano, por ser un texto autobiográfico escrito en primera persona en el periodo de vejez del filósofo.El 'Protágoras', como todos los escritos platónicos, es un texto interesante, aunque hasta cierto punto inconcluso en sus razonamientos finales. El tema que se trata es la esencia de la virtud - el areté -, pero también la posibilidad o no de su enseñanza, esto es, nada menos que de la labor del sofista. Pero en el 'Protágoras' no solo se enfrentan dos posturas intelectuales, sino dos formas de discurso, una auténtica guerra de métodos. Protágoras se siente cómodo en el monólogo elaborado que arroba a los oyentes, mientras que Sócrates prefiere el diálogo y el mutuo interrogatorio expeditivo. El diálogo nos deja con las respuestas a medias. Parece que buena parte de su peso se basa en medir a estas dos figuras y sus respectivos métodos de discurrir. Seguramente ganaría mucho la lectura en griego antiguo, la lengua original, dado que se juega con distintos términos y formas de expresión. Si el 'Protágoras' me parece algo descentrado e inconcluso, al 'Gorgias' lo veo redondo y completo, una obra maestra, uno de esos textos que nos recuerdan de tanto en tanto por qué hay que leer a los clásicos antiguos. Hay una relación entre los diálogos 'Protágoras' y 'Gorgias' en la crítica que realiza Platón a los sofistas; pero mientras que Protágoras creía necesaria la edificación cívica del hombre, los disputadores del 'Gorgias' adoptan posturas cínicas y nihilistas. Sócrates recibe aquí mucha hostilidad, lo que a mi entender carga a este diálogo de un dramatismo particular en la disputa. Este texto brilla por su pasmosa modernidad y se adelanta para realizar un primer y remoto borrador de algunos de los autores más acerados de los últimos siglos. La temática del diálogo trata en última instancia sobre la moral y el sentido en el que hay que encauzar la vida; aunque se encuadra acerca lo que entonces se llamaba arte de la retórica, que era el conjunto de habilidades sociales y de técnicas de comunicación que debía dominar cualquier ciudadano que quisiese dedicarse a la política, normalmente destinada a los jóvenes de familia aristocrática y pudiente. Creo que para Platón supuso una suerte de manifiesto en el que confesaba, entre líneas, por qué abandonaba la política activa en favor de la investigación filosófica, que le llevaría a fundar su Academia más o menos por las mismas fechas."
7348,Tree and Leaf: Includes Mythopoeia and The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth,J.R.R. Tolkien,4.08,2091,81,Julie Davis,4,"Where do you go after The Lord of the Rings? To the heart of the matter ... Tolkien's famous essay on fairy stories, Leaf by Niggle, and Mythopoeia (which was written as a response to C.S. Lewis saying that myths were lies).As one would expect the essay on fairy stories is rich and deep. I would really like to hear it read aloud but I don't see an audio version anywhere of the entire thing ... so I may just have to record it for myself. When paired with this essay, Leaf by Niggle takes on similarly deep resonance, especially when considering that Tolkien dreamed it. For me as a Catholic, Leaf by Niggle has particularly meaningful spiritual observations which have influenced my actions since I read it about a year ago. Again, this is one I'd like to hear read aloud but it seems not to be available ... so this is another which I may have to record just for myself."
7354,The Shipping News,Annie Proulx,3.83,110335,4137,Nathan,4,"This book snuck up on me. Tricky tricky. It started out interesting enough. Proulx's writing style is mesmerizing, almost hypnotic. I found the book initially to be a relaxing solace on my commute home after a busy day of work, soley because of its use of language and setting. But I hated the characters. All of them. Quoyle, a big, damp loaf of a man, as Proulx describes him, is the definition of pathetic. His daughters are brats. And his wife Petal is a two-dimensional device created solely as a catalyst for the story to come. In the beginning it felt a little forced. Then at some point in the second half, the book went from a nice little read to a ferocious page-turner, and I still am not sure how it became so compelling. There was no melodramatic conflict introduced. No secret codes to be found in paintings. Instead, Proulx builds her momentum slowly, slowly, taking you deeper into the lives of these characters, who started out so hard, unattractive, broken, and nasty. The thing of it is, they start to feel so honest. Before you know it, their presence is comforting. I found I wanted to be with them. Wanted to be in the boat with Quoyle. Wanted to see the green house. Wanted to go to the Christmas Pageant. Wanted to eat flipper pie with him and the girls. Wanted to welcome Aunt home. Quoyle finds redemption from a place that itself is bleak, full of hardship, and dying. I found this to be poetic and strangely uplifting. Its sort of the anti-coming of age story. No beautiful starry-eyed twentysomething trotting off to exotic locations or big cities here. Instead, the story of a middle-aged man who hates himself even more than he hates his circumstance, moving back to his modest roots, finding a lot of darkness in the places he comes from. He watches people fall on hard times and move away, endures monotony, deep cold, harsh storms and odd, forced relationships. And in the midst of it he finds friendship, love, and his own self-worth. I just thought it was beautiful. The scene near the end in which Quoyle prepares to attend the wake for one of his close friends, looks at his gigantic naked body in the mirror, and feels a surge of joy to be such an honest and satisfying moment of redemption. This dying place brings him to life, and eventually, for the first time in his life, he finds joy and peace. And he finds it in himself, not in the circumstances around him. It snuck up on me. I didn't realize until it was too late how hard I had fallen for this lot."
586,Art of Modern Rock: The Poster Explosion,Paul Grushkin,4.12,1065,21,Johnny Thief,5,"Biased review, as I'm one of the artists in this book. The first book, The Art of Rock, was my Bible when I was a kid, & introduced me to artists who'd become personal heroes of my career; Stanley Mouse, Shawn Kerri, & Rick Griffin. I'd stay up all night getting baked & stealing all I could from that book. A group of poster artists came together in Philly for a monster poster show called Artifacts of the Improbable, including live music at the Trocadero. I heard that author Grushkin was going to be there & was stoked, I just wanted to say thank you for the first book. Little did I know he'd interview me & include me in the publication. For me, it as like being asked to be the 13th apostle. The book is stellar, over 400 artists from around the planet, (& before this book, who knew there were poster artists in Transylvania?) creating some of the best art on the planet for every band that ever payed music. The book design is inspired, with themed chapter that breaks down the styles & genres. You'll need hours to make it through,... My copy is signed & marked by at least 30 of these artists, who are close personal friends. Nyah nyah!!Also check out the companion books by co author Dennis King. The Poster girls book in particular includes more of my work, including two posters on the back cover. Yes, I'm geeking out. You would too if you were in this one! ;)"
9164,Ballet for Dummies,Scott Speck,4,72,7,Laura,4,"I give 4.5 stars to this book because even though it gives a very good overview of all the moves/positions and proper technique (with pictures) it is a bit too basic if you have already had a taste of ballet. For example, I consider myself a beginner because I've being dancing for a year but I found the book quite easy.Taking that out of the equation it is a really good book to read if you're a beginner or just want to have a clear overview of the exercises and moves ballet dancers go through everyday.—P.S.

3686,Truth and Beauty,Ann Patchett,3.94,28608,2676,Barbara Mader,1,"I didn't care for it, for several reasons. First of all, I didn't think much of the quality of the writing--certainly nothing like Lucy Grealy's in her own memoir. Second, I found both women's behavior in the friendship really strange. Ann seems completely blank in the relationship, never asserting any real personality, and completely enabling Lucy's neediness and selfishness. Lucy just sounded like a black hole, sucking up every bit of attention, affection, needing more and more extravagant declarations of love. She sounded exhausting.And finally, I think it exploitative of Ann Pratchett to write a book like this about someone she supposedly felt was her best friend when that person could no longer respond, particularly as Ann wasn't truly writing about the relationship at all. She did not write about her own feelings of the friendship, why and how it developed as it did, what kept them together, what she learned about herself, how (or whether!) Lucy brought out the best in her, etc.; in fact, there seems to be very little reflection on or ownership about her own behavior. Mostly it seems to be an expose' about Lucy. I just came away feeling that both these women sounded really messed up, needy, difficult, self-absorbed, and not at all self-aware, and that both had a habit of using terrible judgment in their personal lives. Yuck. If this is truth--I do mean ""if""--it's not beauty, and I wonder why anyone would want either of them as a friend."
3684,The Black Book of Hollywood Beauty Secrets,Kym Douglas,3.31,127,16,Laurie,3,"Taken in small doses, this jam-packed inside look at the surprising beauty rituals of A-list stars serves as a funny, fascinating wake-up call to the harsh reality of celebrity self-maintenance. Image consultant Douglas and freelance writer Pearlman reveal the staggering lengths to which some stars go, including everything from pre-Oscar night colonics to the anatomically incorrect deployment of lip plumpers. While there is a great deal of sensible advice included, there's also some deliciously bizarre rituals on display, such as Kate Beckinsale's three-baths-a-day regimen and Cindy Crawford's secret to beautiful skin, a regular dose of ""leftover milk from her kids' bottles and equal parts mineral water,"" applied with a spray bottle. The best element of this insider's guide is the winning tone of self-described ""former dorks"" Douglas and Pearlman, who keep things light, dishy and fun.

3685,Black Beauty,Anna Sewell,3.94,197080,3464,James,3,"     Review
  
Black Beauty by Anna Sewell is a beautiful story meant for older children or very young adults. It was written in the 19th century by a woman who passed away shortly after its publication. I enjoyed the story and have given it a 3 of 5 stars, which is still very good in my book.A few interesting things:1. The point of view in the book is from Black Beauty, the horse.2. It takes place in London nearly 150 years ago.3. It's still a cherished story for both pleasure reading and education purposes.I received it as a gift when I was about 8 or 9, as I had asked for several ""classics"" for Christmas. When I saw the cover, I thought it looked pretty. But not enough to read it. It sat on my shelf for probably two years until one day, I said ""let's just give it a chance."" I was afraid it would be too boring... I've always preferred complex plots and strong characters. I wasn't sure this would really work for me. I was wrong!Seeing how people mistreated and misunderstood animals was a big benefit of the book. It opens your eyes to things from another perspective, and if it helps just a little to develop a bond between younger adults / children and animals, then it's served its purpose.It's one of those books everyone should read... but not as a forced school assignment. It should be something parents want to share with their kids around 7 or 8... teaching them about how to be respectful and kind to all creatures. And then take them horseback riding to see what it's actually like. That's what I did when I finished it... went with a small group of friends to a riding academy / farm a few towns over and learned about horses for one summer. I kinda miss riding... maybe I should try it again. Off topic again... what is up with me today on these reviews! :)

Maybe because I was made to study Of Mice and Men to death in school, or maybe because I thought The Grapes of Wrath was a little overrated. But I've been missing out.A closer look should have told me that. Because I love family sagas. Epic, multi-generational tales filled with rich characterization and plenty of drama.

Steinbeck could not have more vividly painted the Salinas Valley in our minds if he had literally dragged us there in person. It's a beautiful, dusty, challenging place to be and into it comes the story of the Trasks and the Hamiltons.

9606,"Happy Birthday, Wanda June",Kurt Vonnegut Jr.,3.49,3355,101,Cindy,3,"What an odd, quick read. Vonnegut wrote only one play (thank goodness!) and set it as a retelling of Odysseus's return home from war set in the mid 20th century. Like the Odyssey, Penelope has several suitors and a son who lamely attempts to fight them off. The role of the returning war hero is Penelope's brutish husband, Harold, an older, gruffy, rude man who's been missing for 8 years while diamond hunting. A lover of big game, guns and ""traditional"" masculinity, he revels in his surprise return and emotional control over his family.Frequently the play reads like something from The Theater of the Absurd. The stilted dialogue, particularly at the end, lends to this affect. In true Vonnegut fashion, Happy Birthday, Wanda June is a commentary on heroism, war, and death. So it goes.One funny note: I noticed the original Off-Broadway cast (1970-71) included Dianne Wiest (In Treatment, Law & Order, Edward Scissorhands, etc.) as the female understudy."
9607, Palm Sunday/Welcome to the Monkeyhouse,Kurt Vonnegut Jr.,4.16,513,21,Cat,3,"Oh wow! I finished it! Almost three months later...I could say how ashamed I am about taking so long to read a less-than-650-pages book, but there was a mix of factors that prevented me from reading it faster. So, no, I'm not ashamed.Relived, yes. With mixed feelings, too.I borrowed this 2 in 1 book from a colleague from work, a Vonnegut fan, who cannot seem to lend me the only Vonnegut book I'm curious about: 'Slaughterhouse Five'.But anyway, what can I say after almost three months after I started this book?For one, that I didn't really like 'Welcome to the Monkeyhouse'. The collection of short stories didn't appeal to me that much. For some reason, I never liked their ends. There were some really cool and crazy ideas, but I couldn't, for the life of me, enjoy the way they ended.'Palm Sunday', on the other hand, was really enjoyable. I have never been one to read biographies, but lately I have found that some autobiographies (and maybe that's the thing) are quite interesting. Again, this is a collection of several speeches Vonnegut gave throughout his life in different places and events. But it was really refreshing to read him talking about his family, his childhood, what he saw in WWII, what he thought about writing. It is quite fascinating. I don't know if I will ever be able to enjoy Vonnegut's fiction (if I recall correctly, 'Galapagos' was just alright). But he was definitely very witty and had rather interesting things to say.'Palm Sunday' saved the day, so to speak, even though there were some texts more boring than others. Still, I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who can appreciate irony, and is not easily offended."
4412,American Gods,Neil Gaiman,4.11,534113,28575,Stacey,5,"In 2003, I walked away from my childhood religion – a high control (some would say abusive) group with a tiny little worldview and a severe superiority complex. This was my reality:I believed with all my being that the things depicted above were real, and were just over the event horizon. Leaving meant losing almost every friend I had ever made since childhood, it created a rift with my still devout family, and quite possibly saved my life. Is it any wonder that fiction – alternate realities, fantasy, and mental escape – helped me make that decision, helped me move on, and helped deprogram my cult-think? One fiction supplanted the other, only this time I already knew I was working with stories. Some of this fiction I had read many times, not understanding why the stories resonated so strongly within me, just knowing that I was compelled to return to those worlds, over and over. Others were stories I read during the time surrounding my breakaway, and shortly thereafter.*American Gods made me observe and think differently. It gave me a new context for the mythologies I had accepted for most of my life. It was bigger than the story of Shadow, or the girl Sam, or Czernabog. For me, it was about how we allow our Old Gods to define our present worldview, and how we allow our New Gods to steal our awareness. Our mythologies set the boundaries of our culture, and paradoxically, as our culture changes, our gods sacrifice their immortality.  ""Religions are, by definition, metaphors, after all: God is a dream, a hope, a woman, an ironist, a father, a city, a house of many rooms, a watchmaker who left his prize chronometer in the desert, someone who loves you--even, perhaps, against all evidence, a celestial being whose only interest is to make sure your football team, army, business, or marriage thrives, prospers, and triumphs over all opposition.""The part of the story that affected me the most profoundly was the story of Hinzelmann and Lakeside. The mixing of good and evil, the blurring of lines, townspeople looking the other way – to such a degree that it never occurs to them to see what is happening right under their noses. Dead men's bones. Deaths of legends. It affected me to my core. During the time I was reading American Gods, it was this which rocked me – I was doing the same thing – choosing and keeping and killing my own Gods, my own mythologies. It was tremendously painful, made a little easier by having the opportunity to process it within the bounds of somebody else's story.*The rest of the list:DuneChapterhouse DuneFahrenheit 451Animal Farm1984SandmanCrisis of ConscienceUnder the Banner of HeavenSeductive Poison"
9621,The Stories of Ray Bradbury Volume 2,Ray Bradbury,4.41,158,10,Ingo,4,"I don't envy the editors of this collection. There are easier tasks than deciding what to choose from the 500+ stories Brad Bradbury has written in his 90+ years. These two volumes combine about 150 of them (stories, not years), so this is the biggest collection to date.There are some classics in here that have been anthologized quite a few times: ""There Will Come Soft Rains"", ""A Sound of Thunder"", ""Mars Is Heaven"" among others.From the lesser known stories I particularly enjoyed some of the creepy ones: e.g. ""The Town Where No One Got Off"", ""Marionettes, Inc."" and the wonderfully twisted ""Night Call, Collect"".Some of the rocket-and-aliens-imagery may seem a little quaint today but I'd argue they only reinforce (if unintentionally) the nostalgia that has always pervaded the fiction of Ray Bradbury.

9620,"Farewell Summer (Green Town, #3)",Ray Bradbury,3.71,3390,340,Lyn,3,"Ray Bradbury is to American literature as Credence Clearwater Revival is to classic rock, a producer of compact, meaningful, entertaining genre ambiguous work that speaks with a masterful voice. Farewell Summer is the sequel to Dandelion Wine, published 50 years after the first work. In an afterward, Bradbury stated that the bulk of what would become Farewell Summer was created at the same time as the classic Dandelion Wine but the publishers thought the original work too long and convinced the author to put off the second half until later. No doubt none of the publishers would have guessed the half a century lapse, and Bradbury hints that he edited it off and on over the years until it was as ripe as an autumn apple. Farewell Summer is the coming of age story of Douglas Spaulding, introduced to readers in Dandelion Wine. As most of his work, it is beautifully written, poignant and nostalgic yet with a depth and life of its own. Definitely for the Bradbury fan, a reader unfamiliar with his works would be better to begin with some short stories or Fahrenheit 451, but this is a good read."

9622,Classic Stories 1: The Golden Apples of the Sun/R Is for Rocket (Grand Master),Ray Bradbury,4.21,5496,195,Özlem,5,"I'm completely stunned by Bradbury! How can anyone depicts and express any feeling in such a deep, impressive way without using the word describing that very feeling itself? Depiction of the fog horn's voice inside the lighthouse in story ""the fog horn"" is such an example of this. ""One day many years ago a man walked along and stood in the sound of the ocean on a cold sunless shore and said, 'We need a voice to call across the water, to warn ships; I'll make one.I'll make a voice like all of time and all of the fog that ever was; I'll make a voice that is like an empty bed beside you all night long, and like an empty house when you open the door, and like trees in autumn with no leaves. A sound like the birds flying south, crying, and a sound like November wind and the sea on the hard, cold shore. I'll make a sound that's so alone that no one can miss it, that whoever hears it will weep in their souls, and hearts will seem warmer, and being inside will seem better to all who hear it in the distant towns. I'll make me a sound and an apparatus and they'll call it a Fog Horn and whoever hears it will know the sadness of eternity and the briefness of life'.""...I felt like I was almost personally experiencing that deep sorrow and melancholy at that moment right after I've read this paragraph. They were that real, and that vivid for me... In one of his other short stories named ""The Sound of Summer Running"", a father asks his son why he needs those new pair of sneakers. And here is the boy's answer, which for me, standing once more as a proof of Bradbury's glorious way of depicting the feeling: ""It was because they felt the way it feels every summer when you take off your shoes for the first time and run in the grass. They felt like it feels sticking your feet out of the hot covers in the wintertime to let the cold wind from the open window blow on them suddenly and you let them stay out a long time until you pull them back in under the covers again to feel them, like packed snow. The tennis shoes felt like it always feels the first time every year wading in the slow waters of the creek and seeing your feet below, half an inch further downstream, with reflection, than the real part of you above water.""..."
7605,Lolita (Everyman's Library Classics),Vladimir Nabokov,3.88,523318,18380,"Ian ""Marvin"" Graye",5,"Between the CoversHaving just re-read ""Lolita"", I asked my local bookseller if she had ever read it.She replied firmly, “No…and I’m not going to either. He’s a paedophile.”A bit taken aback, I enquired further, “Who? The author or the character?”Fortunately, she replied, “The character.”For me, this exchange showed how much “Lolita” can still sharply divide opinion, even within lovers of fiction.This wasn’t the conversation I had been hoping for.I had read “Lolita” in a couple of days, less time than my work commitments normally allow me, but I found it incredibly easy to read.Even though I was taking notes, even though I was conscious that Nabokov was playing games (even if I didn’t always know what game), even though there were unfamiliar words I should have looked up, I was constantly drawn towards the conclusion.I wanted to talk to someone about my experience straight away.My cheeks were still flushed, my nerve endings were still tingling, I had experienced the “spine thrill of delight”, I felt like I had just had sex with a book.Now, not being a smoker, all I needed was some post-coital conversation.And there was no one around to converse with.And the book wasn’t giving away any more of its secrets than it already had.Nor was it going to tell me I had been a Good Reader or that it had appreciated my attentiveness.It was back between the covers, challenging me to start again.Three Act Word PlayAt a superficial level, “Lolita” is a relatively straight-forward novel.Once you know that it concerns sexual relations between 37 year old Humbert Humbert and 12 year old Dolores “Lolita” Hayes, you just about know the plot.There’s a beginning, a middle and an end.A grooming, a consummation, an aftermath.Nabokov makes of his material a three act play.And he does so playfully, seductively, lyrically, charmingly, amusingly, dangerously.To this day, I cannot look at Humbert’s initials “H.H.” without pronouncing them in German, “Ha Ha”, and wondering whether the joke is on us.Beneath the skin of the novel, there is much more.There is a whole complex living organism.You can lose yourself within its arms for days, weeks, months, a lifetime.As long as your love of wordplay, your love of words and play, will permit you.Again, at a superficial level, there is an almighty conflict between morality and aesthetics happening between the pages.Whether or not Nabokov deliberately put the conflict there, he put the subject matter there.We, the readers, can supply our own conflict in the way we read his novel.Nabokov knew the subject matter would inflame us, if not our desires, then at least our morals, our sense of righteousness.Morality and aesthetics are intertwined within the fabric of the novel.They embrace each other in one long death roll, just like Humbert Humbert and Clare Quilty.We watch their interaction, open-mouthed, open-minded, but ultimately they have to be pulled apart or separated.When they are together, they are one.When they are apart, they are each other’s double.The Morality of the StoryThere is no doubt that sexual relations between an adult and a minor are not just immoral, but criminal as well.That is an unquestionable fact.From a legal point of view, the motive of the adult is irrelevant to the proof of the crime.The consent of the minor is irrelevant to the proof of the crime.If Humbert had been charged with an offence of sexual relations with a minor, he would have had no legal defence.Any question as to whether Lolita really seduced Humbert would have been irrelevant.In fact, the evidence might not even have been admissible, except potentially as part of the determination of the penalty.In other words, even if it was relevant to penalty, it was not relevant to guilt.Because morality is a social construct that depends on collective endorsement, he had no moral defence either.The personal views of the individual are not really that relevant to society’s determination that an act is immoral.The choice of the individual is to comply or offend.Of Traps and CagesHumbert offended not just once, but untold numerous times over two years.He carefully planned his seduction, he set his trap, he caught his prey, even if someone might want to argue that this 12 year old seductress walked voluntarily into the trap.Having freed Lolita from the trap, he imprisoned her in a cage, and repeated his crime.Again, someone could argue that she had plenty of opportunities to flee the cage (which she eventually did).But Humbert surrounded Lolita with an elaborate system of self-doubt that convinced her that she would become a ward of the state if they were found out.The Legality of the Confession“Lolita” is written from Humbert’s point of view.It is not just a recollection in his mind, it is a formal, written document.He sat down and wrote it in 56 days between his capture in 1952 (charged only with the crime of murdering Clare Quilty) and his death in prison before his trial could occur.For me, the written document is a fascinating choice of literary device to tell the story.The document becomes a book within a book.While Nabokov obviously wrote it, all that he purports to do is sandwich it between a Foreword and a (much later) Afterword.This device sets up an interesting relationship between Humbert and the reader.For Humbert, it is akin to a confession or a witness statement.To this extent, what he confesses to is clearly enough to convict him of the crime of murder.However, in it, he also sets out details of crimes that, for whatever reason, he was never charged with.If his lawyer had read the document while he was still alive, he would probably have excised all of the other confessions, because they would have prejudiced his client’s case (at least with respect to penalty).The Role of the JuryFor the reader, the confession defines our relationship to the events that are described.We are cast in the role of a member of the Jury.This device allows heinous moral and criminal acts to be described and read and examined within a legal and therefore legitimate framework.In a sense, the book becomes a report of sorts on legal proceedings.We become legitimate observers and listeners to something that might otherwise have been prurient and offensive and illegal.Yet, we have to do our duty and participate in the legal process, because it is an important part of the justice system.Even though we have a legitimate interest in participating, I wonder whether we are still voyeuristic.Nabokov has trapped us in a game that persuades us that it is serious, but ends up being just as playful and perverse as the subject matter of the crime.In a way, Nabokov makes us complicit in a crime, if not Humbert’s crime, then perhaps our own thought crime.It is also material that, by the time Humbert’s confession is read, both Humbert and Lolita have died of natural causes.Humbert speaks from the other side of death.Nobody is alive, nobody can be hurt any more than they already have.The Confessions of an Unreliable Narrator (The Fox and the Peacock)I explored these issues, because I wanted to understand Humbert’s motivation for his confession.He is effectively pleading guilty.I don’t see any prospect for an insanity defence, even though he seemed to have been in and out of sanatoria at times of crisis.Equally, I don’t think that anything he reveals would reduce the penalty for the murder.To do so, he only needed to focus on his concern that Quilty had wronged Lolita in some way even worse than his own actions.But to confess all of these other crimes seems to be counter-productive.Similarly, I don’t think he was lying about the detail, I think that he was telling the truth, and that he was telling the truth, so that he could be understood, no more, no less.Humbert’s confession is not just the fiction of a dirty old man, it is not false or fabricated, it is not a mirage.No matter how immoral, no matter how deluded, no matter how selfish and narcissistic, it is his fact, his reality, his truth, his burden, his shame.His actions were the pursuit of a rational man, not an insane one.He was film-star handsome, educated, intellectual, talented, witty, charming, calculating, calculated, dangerous.There is no doubt that he was a talented performer, an exceptional player.However, Humbert is not an actor wearing a mask, performing some other fictional character or version of himself.I believe that we are seeing him for what he really is.He is as cunning, tricky, sly as a fox and as refined, elaborate, attractive as a peacock.His decoration, his ornamentation is part of him, his life, his loins, his sin, his soul.In pursuit of Lolita, he was prepared to lie and deceive in order to achieve his goal.I don’t believe that he was prepared to lie to us, if only because there was no point in lying.When occasionally he questions the veracity of his own account, it is solely to question the accuracy of his memory.However, he didn’t need to tell lies to achieve leniency, he didn’t need to tell the truth for some ulterior motive.By confessing to anything, he would only be found guilty of crimes he hadn’t been charged with in addition to the charge of murder he had been accused of.There was no point in confessing to anything extra, other than to tell the truth as he saw it.It wasn’t going to get him any sympathy or reduce his penalty, if anything, his disclosures would aggravate his penalty.To this extent, I don’t consider Humbert an “unreliable narrator”.I realise that some might respond that paedophiles are habitual liars and can’t help themselves.That might well be the case, but I think it is our horror at his crime, our moral judgment affecting our assessment of the whole of the person and shaping our (aesthetic) response to the book and the character.Perhaps naively, I want to find some good in him.Ultimately, whether or not Humbert’s love was morally wrong, I believe that he wanted us to understand his love and what he learned about his love by the end of his story.What We Talk about When We Talk about Humbert’s LoveTechnically, the sexual relations between Humbert and Lolita are not an example of “paedophilia” (which is a sexual preference for a pre-pubescent).While nothing moral or legal turns on the distinction, the sexual relations constitute “hebephilia” (which is a sexual preference for a person in the early stage of puberty).The name derives from “Hebe”, the Greek goddess of youth.Her name means youth or prime of life, and she personified both youth and immortality.She was the cup bearer who served nectar to the Olympian Gods to give them everlasting youth.First Part (Obsessive Love)For me, during the first part of the book, Humbert’s love was forbidden, but genuine.It was a transgressive love, in that it was a love of the particular aesthetic form that youth takes between the ages of ten and fifteen.The body is at its most perfect, it has not started to age, to wrinkle, to fill out, to droop, to deteriorate.After that age, the body starts to age, and he finds that physically unattractive (as in the case of his first wife and Lolita's mother).OK, we all make choices about our love objects.How can we account for our choices?There’s no accounting for love.Still, at the heart of this aesthetic approach to love is a fear or disgust at aging and mortality.There is an unreality, a lack of understanding and acceptance of the cycle of life and death, a Peter Pan desire to stay forever young, forever immortal.I also think there is a self-love or narcissism inherent in this aesthetic view.I love the young, because I love the perfect form of my own youth.Since my youth, I have fallen, morally and physically.I therefore have to preserve the visage of my own youth.I wonder whether it is only possible to have this view if you have never had your own biological child.Parenthood is an education in the reality of aging.It is an illusion to believe that you can live and defeat it.But tell that to the cosmetics industry.So far I have talked of love in the abstract.In the first part of the book, I struggled to understand Humbert’s love and the above is what I came up with.I won’t say I had a sympathy for him, but I think I understood him and his love.I even understood his obsessiveness.How many of us, during the first throes of love, trap and oppress our love object, so much so that we are not able to see how oppressive we were, until after the relationship has been consummated, or morphed into something more mature or ended?However, things started to change at the end of the first part (the consummation) and into the second part (the imprisonment).Of course the love had to be consummated, but as unexceptional as the description of the event was, it highlighted the reality that the first part was a trap for Lolita to walk into.As playful and lyrical as the language might have been, it was sinister in intent.Second Part (Captivating Love)During the second part, having captured Lo, Humbert makes it clear that his love will last no more than three years, to be precise, 1 January, 1947 to 1 January, 1950, which are effectively her 12th to 15th birthdays.After this, statistically at least, Lo will morph out of her nymphet form.So Humbert's love is solely for a definitive phase of her entire life, after which he expects and intends to abandon her.During this phase, Humbert’s goal is to maintain Lolita in captivity, to ensure her availability for him alone. There is no fairy tale promise of “happily ever after” or “’til death do us part” in this love action.There is no love or concern for the other, only selfishness and narcissism.I have tried to view the definition of beauty that appeals to Humbert as an aesthetic issue.I have tried to divorce it from morality, so I can understand it better.However, whether I think of it in terms of aesthetics or morality, obsession or love, the fact that it could be switched on and off at such identifiable times turned me against Humbert.He is in control of this feeling called love, at least, he knows with clinical precision when he will return to “normality” or a state of not loving.His love was a drug that he took too knowingly, he knew precisely when the feeling of the drug would wear off.So, I started to believe that there was no loss of self in his love.Instead, it was a heightened or gross act of narcissism.By extension, there was no sense in which he tried to ""satisfy"" Lo personally or sexually.There was no sense of a mutually satisfying relationship or intercourse (although to be fair, he doesn't go into the sexual detail, except in terms of physical exertion).However, I got the sense that, when it came to consummating his love, it was just about sticking his dick into his love object.OK, lots of sexual relationships can be reduced to this fundamental penetrative act.Some men see femaleness as no more than a receptacle for maleness and its fluid manifestation, the cup into which they spill their seed.However, I started to feel in the second part that Humbert's aim was to defile or despoil the beauty that had appealed to him in the first part (even if it was transgressive).And the three year zone of enchantment highlighted to me that Humbert would just go in search of the next beautiful nymphet to stick his dick into.So it became increasingly apparent to me that he was a serial despoiler of beauty, not a genuine lover or admirer of beauty.There is a hatred or disgust hotwired into this love.You don't normally hate the flowers in your vase when it comes time to remove them and throw them in the dustbin.But you get the sense that Humbert would have been disgusted by his former love objects, his objet d'obsession, the moment that calendar clicked over.Obviously, this same disgust or loss of interest appears in more traditional relationships.It could lie behind the mid-life crisis when the guy runs away with the younger woman.It could explain the inability to accept the inevitability of aging, at least in our partner.It could explain we males who still picture ourselves as the immutable 20 year old who deserves a young and nubile partner (no matter how soft or old or fat or ugly we have become).So Humbert’s love can teach the rest of us something about our own love.Last Part (Adult Love Denied)I wrote most of my comments about the second part before I had finished reading the last part of the novel.I have to emphasise that most of what turned me against Humbert came from my reaction to his own words.Neither he nor Nabokov held back the material that would make me hate him.Still, I read on, firmly in their constrictive embrace, until chapter 29, when Humbert and the seventeen year old, married and pregnant Dolores meet again.What you think of Humbert and his love, whether or not you think he is lying, depends on your interpretation of the confessions in this chapter:“…there she was with her ruined looks and her adult, rope-veined narrow hands and her gooseflesh white arms, and her shallow ears, and her unkempt armpits, there she was (my Lolita!), hopelessly worn at seventeen, with that baby… and I looked and I looked at her, and knew as clearly as I know I am to die, that I loved her more than anything I had ever seen or imagined on earth, or hoped for anywhere else…“What I used to pamper among the tangled vines of my heart…had dwindled to its essence: sterile and selfish vice, all that I cancelled and cursed…“You may jeer at me, and threaten to clear the court, but until I am gagged and half-throttled, I will shout my poor truth.“I insist the world know how much I loved my Lolita, this Lolita, pale and polluted, and big with another’s child, but still gray-eyed, still sooty-lashed, still auburn and almond, still Carmencita, still mine.”This is just one part of Humbert’s journey.He realised that he still loved her outside the hebephile zone.However, he still clung to “his” Lolita, the Lolita of his deluded version of love.Obviously, Dolores is and never was “his” version of reality, she was her own person, and she declines his love a second time.Only then does he recognise that he “did not know a thing about [his] darling’s mind” or that “a North American girl-child named Dolores Haze had been deprived of her childhood by a maniac”.Then he quotes “an old poet” (presumably Nabokov himself):“The moral sense in mortals is the duty“We have to pay on mortal sense of beauty.”In other words, you can’t just indulge an aesthetic sense of beauty at the expense of a real human being, it comes attached to and constrained by morality.Morality, taboo and the law work together to protect innocence and beauty from those who would defile and despoil it.He was not above the law, he was no Nietzschian Superman.He was the fool in his own play.The TragedyThere are suggestions that Nabokov saw Humbert’s story as a tragedy, that Humbert only realised that he genuinely loved Dolores by conventional standards when it was too late.That might be so, but Humbert only had himself to blame.He was a victim of his own hand, and his tragedy was nothing compared with the one he made Dolores endure, so that he, too selfishly for love, could have his “Lolita”."
7606,The Annotated Lolita,Vladimir Nabokov,3.88,523353,18383,"Ian ""Marvin"" Graye",5,"Between the CoversHaving just re-read ""Lolita"", I asked my local bookseller if she had ever read it.She replied firmly, “No…and I’m not going to either. He’s a paedophile.”A bit taken aback, I enquired further, “Who? The author or the character?”Fortunately, she replied, “The character.”For me, this exchange showed how much “Lolita” can still sharply divide opinion, even within lovers of fiction.This wasn’t the conversation I had been hoping for.I had read “Lolita” in a couple of days, less time than my work commitments normally allow me, but I found it incredibly easy to read.Even though I was taking notes, even though I was conscious that Nabokov was playing games (even if I didn’t always know what game), even though there were unfamiliar words I should have looked up, I was constantly drawn towards the conclusion.I wanted to talk to someone about my experience straight away.My cheeks were still flushed, my nerve endings were still tingling, I had experienced the “spine thrill of delight”, I felt like I had just had sex with a book.Now, not being a smoker, all I needed was some post-coital conversation.And there was no one around to converse with.And the book wasn’t giving away any more of its secrets than it already had.Nor was it going to tell me I had been a Good Reader or that it had appreciated my attentiveness.It was back between the covers, challenging me to start again.Three Act Word PlayAt a superficial level, “Lolita” is a relatively straight-forward novel.Once you know that it concerns sexual relations between 37 year old Humbert Humbert and 12 year old Dolores “Lolita” Hayes, you just about know the plot.There’s a beginning, a middle and an end.A grooming, a consummation, an aftermath.Nabokov makes of his material a three act play.And he does so playfully, seductively, lyrically, charmingly, amusingly, dangerously.To this day, I cannot look at Humbert’s initials “H.H.” without pronouncing them in German, “Ha Ha”, and wondering whether the joke is on us.Beneath the skin of the novel, there is much more.There is a whole complex living organism.You can lose yourself within its arms for days, weeks, months, a lifetime.As long as your love of wordplay, your love of words and play, will permit you.Again, at a superficial level, there is an almighty conflict between morality and aesthetics happening between the pages.Whether or not Nabokov deliberately put the conflict there, he put the subject matter there.We, the readers, can supply our own conflict in the way we read his novel.Nabokov knew the subject matter would inflame us, if not our desires, then at least our morals, our sense of righteousness.Morality and aesthetics are intertwined within the fabric of the novel.They embrace each other in one long death roll, just like Humbert Humbert and Clare Quilty.We watch their interaction, open-mouthed, open-minded, but ultimately they have to be pulled apart or separated.When they are together, they are one.When they are apart, they are each other’s double.The Morality of the StoryThere is no doubt that sexual relations between an adult and a minor are not just immoral, but criminal as well.That is an unquestionable fact.From a legal point of view, the motive of the adult is irrelevant to the proof of the crime.The consent of the minor is irrelevant to the proof of the crime.If Humbert had been charged with an offence of sexual relations with a minor, he would have had no legal defence.Any question as to whether Lolita really seduced Humbert would have been irrelevant.In fact, the evidence might not even have been admissible, except potentially as part of the determination of the penalty.In other words, even if it was relevant to penalty, it was not relevant to guilt.Because morality is a social construct that depends on collective endorsement, he had no moral defence either.The personal views of the individual are not really that relevant to society’s determination that an act is immoral.The choice of the individual is to comply or offend.Of Traps and CagesHumbert offended not just once, but untold numerous times over two years.He carefully planned his seduction, he set his trap, he caught his prey, even if someone might want to argue that this 12 year old seductress walked voluntarily into the trap.Having freed Lolita from the trap, he imprisoned her in a cage, and repeated his crime.Again, someone could argue that she had plenty of opportunities to flee the cage (which she eventually did).But Humbert surrounded Lolita with an elaborate system of self-doubt that convinced her that she would become a ward of the state if they were found out.The Legality of the Confession“Lolita” is written from Humbert’s point of view.It is not just a recollection in his mind, it is a formal, written document.He sat down and wrote it in 56 days between his capture in 1952 (charged only with the crime of murdering Clare Quilty) and his death in prison before his trial could occur.For me, the written document is a fascinating choice of literary device to tell the story.The document becomes a book within a book.While Nabokov obviously wrote it, all that he purports to do is sandwich it between a Foreword and a (much later) Afterword.This device sets up an interesting relationship between Humbert and the reader.For Humbert, it is akin to a confession or a witness statement.To this extent, what he confesses to is clearly enough to convict him of the crime of murder.However, in it, he also sets out details of crimes that, for whatever reason, he was never charged with.If his lawyer had read the document while he was still alive, he would probably have excised all of the other confessions, because they would have prejudiced his client’s case (at least with respect to penalty).The Role of the JuryFor the reader, the confession defines our relationship to the events that are described.We are cast in the role of a member of the Jury.This device allows heinous moral and criminal acts to be described and read and examined within a legal and therefore legitimate framework.In a sense, the book becomes a report of sorts on legal proceedings.We become legitimate observers and listeners to something that might otherwise have been prurient and offensive and illegal.Yet, we have to do our duty and participate in the legal process, because it is an important part of the justice system.Even though we have a legitimate interest in participating, I wonder whether we are still voyeuristic.Nabokov has trapped us in a game that persuades us that it is serious, but ends up being just as playful and perverse as the subject matter of the crime.In a way, Nabokov makes us complicit in a crime, if not Humbert’s crime, then perhaps our own thought crime.It is also material that, by the time Humbert’s confession is read, both Humbert and Lolita have died of natural causes.Humbert speaks from the other side of death.Nobody is alive, nobody can be hurt any more than they already have.The Confessions of an Unreliable Narrator (The Fox and the Peacock)I explored these issues, because I wanted to understand Humbert’s motivation for his confession.He is effectively pleading guilty.I don’t see any prospect for an insanity defence, even though he seemed to have been in and out of sanatoria at times of crisis.Equally, I don’t think that anything he reveals would reduce the penalty for the murder.To do so, he only needed to focus on his concern that Quilty had wronged Lolita in some way even worse than his own actions.But to confess all of these other crimes seems to be counter-productive.Similarly, I don’t think he was lying about the detail, I think that he was telling the truth, and that he was telling the truth, so that he could be understood, no more, no less.Humbert’s confession is not just the fiction of a dirty old man, it is not false or fabricated, it is not a mirage.No matter how immoral, no matter how deluded, no matter how selfish and narcissistic, it is his fact, his reality, his truth, his burden, his shame.His actions were the pursuit of a rational man, not an insane one.He was film-star handsome, educated, intellectual, talented, witty, charming, calculating, calculated, dangerous.There is no doubt that he was a talented performer, an exceptional player.However, Humbert is not an actor wearing a mask, performing some other fictional character or version of himself.I believe that we are seeing him for what he really is.He is as cunning, tricky, sly as a fox and as refined, elaborate, attractive as a peacock.His decoration, his ornamentation is part of him, his life, his loins, his sin, his soul.In pursuit of Lolita, he was prepared to lie and deceive in order to achieve his goal.I don’t believe that he was prepared to lie to us, if only because there was no point in lying.When occasionally he questions the veracity of his own account, it is solely to question the accuracy of his memory.However, he didn’t need to tell lies to achieve leniency, he didn’t need to tell the truth for some ulterior motive.By confessing to anything, he would only be found guilty of crimes he hadn’t been charged with in addition to the charge of murder he had been accused of.There was no point in confessing to anything extra, other than to tell the truth as he saw it.It wasn’t going to get him any sympathy or reduce his penalty, if anything, his disclosures would aggravate his penalty.To this extent, I don’t consider Humbert an “unreliable narrator”.I realise that some might respond that paedophiles are habitual liars and can’t help themselves.That might well be the case, but I think it is our horror at his crime, our moral judgment affecting our assessment of the whole of the person and shaping our (aesthetic) response to the book and the character.Perhaps naively, I want to find some good in him.Ultimately, whether or not Humbert’s love was morally wrong, I believe that he wanted us to understand his love and what he learned about his love by the end of his story.What We Talk about When We Talk about Humbert’s LoveTechnically, the sexual relations between Humbert and Lolita are not an example of “paedophilia” (which is a sexual preference for a pre-pubescent).While nothing moral or legal turns on the distinction, the sexual relations constitute “hebephilia” (which is a sexual preference for a person in the early stage of puberty).The name derives from “Hebe”, the Greek goddess of youth.Her name means youth or prime of life, and she personified both youth and immortality.She was the cup bearer who served nectar to the Olympian Gods to give them everlasting youth.First Part (Obsessive Love)For me, during the first part of the book, Humbert’s love was forbidden, but genuine.It was a transgressive love, in that it was a love of the particular aesthetic form that youth takes between the ages of ten and fifteen.The body is at its most perfect, it has not started to age, to wrinkle, to fill out, to droop, to deteriorate.After that age, the body starts to age, and he finds that physically unattractive (as in the case of his first wife and Lolita's mother).OK, we all make choices about our love objects.How can we account for our choices?There’s no accounting for love.Still, at the heart of this aesthetic approach to love is a fear or disgust at aging and mortality.There is an unreality, a lack of understanding and acceptance of the cycle of life and death, a Peter Pan desire to stay forever young, forever immortal.I also think there is a self-love or narcissism inherent in this aesthetic view.I love the young, because I love the perfect form of my own youth.Since my youth, I have fallen, morally and physically.I therefore have to preserve the visage of my own youth.I wonder whether it is only possible to have this view if you have never had your own biological child.Parenthood is an education in the reality of aging.It is an illusion to believe that you can live and defeat it.But tell that to the cosmetics industry.So far I have talked of love in the abstract.In the first part of the book, I struggled to understand Humbert’s love and the above is what I came up with.I won’t say I had a sympathy for him, but I think I understood him and his love.I even understood his obsessiveness.How many of us, during the first throes of love, trap and oppress our love object, so much so that we are not able to see how oppressive we were, until after the relationship has been consummated, or morphed into something more mature or ended?However, things started to change at the end of the first part (the consummation) and into the second part (the imprisonment).Of course the love had to be consummated, but as unexceptional as the description of the event was, it highlighted the reality that the first part was a trap for Lolita to walk into.As playful and lyrical as the language might have been, it was sinister in intent.Second Part (Captivating Love)During the second part, having captured Lo, Humbert makes it clear that his love will last no more than three years, to be precise, 1 January, 1947 to 1 January, 1950, which are effectively her 12th to 15th birthdays.After this, statistically at least, Lo will morph out of her nymphet form.So Humbert's love is solely for a definitive phase of her entire life, after which he expects and intends to abandon her.During this phase, Humbert’s goal is to maintain Lolita in captivity, to ensure her availability for him alone. There is no fairy tale promise of “happily ever after” or “’til death do us part” in this love action.There is no love or concern for the other, only selfishness and narcissism.I have tried to view the definition of beauty that appeals to Humbert as an aesthetic issue.I have tried to divorce it from morality, so I can understand it better.However, whether I think of it in terms of aesthetics or morality, obsession or love, the fact that it could be switched on and off at such identifiable times turned me against Humbert.He is in control of this feeling called love, at least, he knows with clinical precision when he will return to “normality” or a state of not loving.His love was a drug that he took too knowingly, he knew precisely when the feeling of the drug would wear off.So, I started to believe that there was no loss of self in his love.Instead, it was a heightened or gross act of narcissism.By extension, there was no sense in which he tried to ""satisfy"" Lo personally or sexually.There was no sense of a mutually satisfying relationship or intercourse (although to be fair, he doesn't go into the sexual detail, except in terms of physical exertion).However, I got the sense that, when it came to consummating his love, it was just about sticking his dick into his love object.OK, lots of sexual relationships can be reduced to this fundamental penetrative act.Some men see femaleness as no more than a receptacle for maleness and its fluid manifestation, the cup into which they spill their seed.However, I started to feel in the second part that Humbert's aim was to defile or despoil the beauty that had appealed to him in the first part (even if it was transgressive).And the three year zone of enchantment highlighted to me that Humbert would just go in search of the next beautiful nymphet to stick his dick into.So it became increasingly apparent to me that he was a serial despoiler of beauty, not a genuine lover or admirer of beauty.There is a hatred or disgust hotwired into this love.You don't normally hate the flowers in your vase when it comes time to remove them and throw them in the dustbin.But you get the sense that Humbert would have been disgusted by his former love objects, his objet d'obsession, the moment that calendar clicked over.Obviously, this same disgust or loss of interest appears in more traditional relationships.It could lie behind the mid-life crisis when the guy runs away with the younger woman.It could explain the inability to accept the inevitability of aging, at least in our partner.It could explain we males who still picture ourselves as the immutable 20 year old who deserves a young and nubile partner (no matter how soft or old or fat or ugly we have become).So Humbert’s love can teach the rest of us something about our own love.Last Part (Adult Love Denied)I wrote most of my comments about the second part before I had finished reading the last part of the novel.I have to emphasise that most of what turned me against Humbert came from my reaction to his own words.Neither he nor Nabokov held back the material that would make me hate him.Still, I read on, firmly in their constrictive embrace, until chapter 29, when Humbert and the seventeen year old, married and pregnant Dolores meet again.What you think of Humbert and his love, whether or not you think he is lying, depends on your interpretation of the confessions in this chapter:“…there she was with her ruined looks and her adult, rope-veined narrow hands and her gooseflesh white arms, and her shallow ears, and her unkempt armpits, there she was (my Lolita!), hopelessly worn at seventeen, with that baby… and I looked and I looked at her, and knew as clearly as I know I am to die, that I loved her more than anything I had ever seen or imagined on earth, or hoped for anywhere else…“What I used to pamper among the tangled vines of my heart…had dwindled to its essence: sterile and selfish vice, all that I cancelled and cursed…“You may jeer at me, and threaten to clear the court, but until I am gagged and half-throttled, I will shout my poor truth.“I insist the world know how much I loved my Lolita, this Lolita, pale and polluted, and big with another’s child, but still gray-eyed, still sooty-lashed, still auburn and almond, still Carmencita, still mine.”This is just one part of Humbert’s journey.He realised that he still loved her outside the hebephile zone.However, he still clung to “his” Lolita, the Lolita of his deluded version of love.Obviously, Dolores is and never was “his” version of reality, she was her own person, and she declines his love a second time.Only then does he recognise that he “did not know a thing about [his] darling’s mind” or that “a North American girl-child named Dolores

other words, you can’t just indulge an aesthetic sense of beauty at the expense of a real human being, it comes attached to and constrained by morality.Morality, taboo and the law work together to protect innocence and beauty from those who would defile and despoil it.He was not above the law, he was no Nietzschian Superman.He was the fool in his own play.The TragedyThere are suggestions that Nabokov saw Humbert’s story as a tragedy, that Humbert only realised that he genuinely loved Dolores by conventional standards when it was too late.That might be so, but Humbert only had himself to blame.He was a victim of his own hand, and his tragedy was nothing compared with the one he made Dolores endure, so that he, too selfishly for love, could have his “Lolita”."
1407,The Eclogues of Virgil: A Translation,Virgil,3.88,1653,56,Blake,5,"Our familiar Virgil tempers the grandeur of the epic with loss, and strikes ambiguous moods in the midst of war glory; but, the lesser known Virgil floods the senses with a rustic imagination drunk on the colourful singing of country air through mountains and over streams. Here the world turns over, like a grave person all wrapped up in earth, and the furniture of the universe weeps with joy for one special child to be seated.True to his peculiar habits of adopting striking contrasts and raising them as natural siblings, Arcadia is temporary and present few times through this poetic life. For under the romantic ground of transformed nature lies a familiar world of political realism and untrammeled power. If Virgil had chosen otherwise than to transfigure, the Eclogues might not have been as lasting as they have been through all proceeding time."
7604,Lolita,Vladimir Nabokov,3.88,523326,18380,"Ian ""Marvin"" Graye",5,"Between the CoversHaving just re-read ""Lolita"", I asked my local bookseller if she had ever read it.She replied firmly, “No…and I’m not going to either. He’s a paedophile.”A bit taken aback, I enquired further, “Who? The author or the character?”Fortunately, she replied, “The character.”For me, this exchange showed how much “Lolita” can still sharply divide opinion, even within lovers of fiction.This wasn’t the conversation I had been hoping for.I had read “Lolita” in a couple of days, less time than my work commitments normally allow me, but I found it incredibly easy to read.Even though I was taking notes, even though I was conscious that Nabokov was playing games (even if I didn’t always know what game), even though there were unfamiliar words I should have looked up, I was constantly drawn towards the conclusion.I wanted to talk to someone about my experience straight away.My cheeks were still flushed, my nerve endings were still tingling, I had experienced the “spine thrill of delight”, I felt like I had just had sex with a book.Now, not being a smoker, all I needed was some post-coital conversation.And there was no one around to converse with.And the book wasn’t giving away any more of its secrets than it already had.Nor was it going to tell me I had been a Good Reader or that it had appreciated my attentiveness.It was back between the covers, challenging me to start again.Three Act Word PlayAt a superficial level, “Lolita” is a relatively straight-forward novel.Once you know that it concerns sexual relations between 37 year old Humbert Humbert and 12 year old Dolores “Lolita” Hayes, you just about know the plot.There’s a beginning, a middle and an end.A grooming, a consummation, an aftermath.Nabokov makes of his material a three act play.And he does so playfully, seductively, lyrically, charmingly, amusingly, dangerously.To this day, I cannot look at Humbert’s initials “H.H.” without pronouncing them in German, “Ha Ha”, and wondering whether the joke is on us.Beneath the skin of the novel, there is much more.There is a whole complex living organism.You can lose yourself within its arms for days, weeks, months, a lifetime.As long as your love of wordplay, your love of words and play, will permit you.Again, at a superficial level, there is an almighty conflict between morality and aesthetics happening between the pages.Whether or not Nabokov deliberately put the conflict there, he put the subject matter there.We, the readers, can supply our own conflict in the way we read his novel.Nabokov knew the subject matter would inflame us, if not our desires, then at least our morals, our sense of righteousness.Morality and aesthetics are intertwined within the fabric of the novel.They embrace each other in one long death roll, just like Humbert Humbert and Clare Quilty.We watch their interaction, open-mouthed, open-minded, but ultimately they have to be pulled apart or separated.When they are together, they are one.When they are apart, they are each other’s double.The Morality of the StoryThere is no doubt that sexual relations between an adult and a minor are not just immoral, but criminal as well.That is an unquestionable fact.From a legal point of view, the motive of the adult is irrelevant to the proof of the crime.The consent of the minor is irrelevant to the proof of the crime.If Humbert had been charged with an offence of sexual relations with a minor, he would have had no legal defence.Any question as to whether Lolita really seduced Humbert would have been irrelevant.In fact, the evidence might not even have been admissible, except potentially as part of the determination of the penalty.In other words, even if it was relevant to penalty, it was not relevant to guilt.Because morality is a social construct that depends on collective endorsement, he had no moral defence either.The personal views of the individual are not really that relevant to society’s determination that an act is immoral.The choice of the individual is to comply or offend.Of Traps and CagesHumbert offended not just once, but untold numerous times over two years.He carefully planned his seduction, he set his trap, he caught his prey, even if someone might want to argue that this 12 year old seductress walked voluntarily into the trap.Having freed Lolita from the trap, he imprisoned her in a cage, and repeated his crime.Again, someone could argue that she had plenty of opportunities to flee the cage (which she eventually did).But Humbert surrounded Lolita with an elaborate system of self-doubt that convinced her that she would become a ward of the state if they were found out.The Legality of the Confession“Lolita” is written from Humbert’s point of view.It is not just a recollection in his mind, it is a formal, written document.He sat down and wrote it in 56 days between his capture in 1952 (charged only with the crime of murdering Clare Quilty) and his death in prison before his trial could occur.For me, the written document is a fascinating choice of literary device to tell the story.The document becomes a book within a book.While Nabokov obviously wrote it, all that he purports to do is sandwich it between a Foreword and a (much later) Afterword.This device sets up an interesting relationship between Humbert and the reader.For Humbert, it is akin to a confession or a witness statement.To this extent, what he confesses to is clearly enough to convict him of the crime of murder.However, in it, he also sets out details of crimes that, for whatever reason, he was never charged with.If his lawyer had read the document while he was still alive, he would probably have excised all of the other confessions, because they would have prejudiced his client’s case (at least with respect to penalty).The Role of the JuryFor the reader, the confession defines our relationship to the events that are described.We are cast in the role of a member of the Jury.This device allows heinous moral and criminal acts to be described and read and examined within a legal and therefore legitimate framework.In a sense, the book becomes a report of sorts on legal proceedings.We become legitimate observers and listeners to something that might otherwise have been prurient and offensive and illegal.Yet, we have to do our duty and participate in the legal process, because it is an important part of the justice system.Even though we have a legitimate interest in participating, I wonder whether we are still voyeuristic.Nabokov has trapped us in a game that persuades us that it is serious, but ends up being just as playful and perverse as the subject matter of the crime.In a way, Nabokov makes us complicit in a crime, if not Humbert’s crime, then perhaps our own thought crime.It is also material that, by the time Humbert’s confession is read, both Humbert and Lolita have died of natural causes.Humbert speaks from the other side of death.Nobody is alive, nobody can be hurt any more than they already have.The Confessions of an Unreliable Narrator (The Fox and the Peacock)I explored these issues, because I wanted to understand Humbert’s motivation for his confession.He is effectively pleading guilty.I don’t see any prospect for an insanity defence, even though he seemed to have been in and out of sanatoria at times of crisis.Equally, I don’t think that anything he reveals would reduce the penalty for the murder.To do so, he only needed to focus on his concern that Quilty had wronged Lolita in some way even worse than his own actions.But to confess all of these other crimes seems to be counter-productive.Similarly, I don’t think he was lying about the detail, I think that he was telling the truth, and that he was telling the truth, so that he could be understood, no more, no less.Humbert’s confession is not just the fiction of a dirty old man, it is not false or fabricated, it is not a mirage.No matter how immoral, no matter how deluded, no matter how selfish and narcissistic, it is his fact, his reality, his truth, his burden, his shame.His actions were the pursuit of a rational man, not an insane one.He was film-star handsome, educated, intellectual, talented, witty, charming, calculating, calculated, dangerous.There is no doubt that he was a talented performer, an exceptional player.However, Humbert is not an actor wearing a mask, performing some other fictional character or version of himself.I believe that we are seeing him for what he really is.He is as cunning, tricky, sly as a fox and as refined, elaborate, attractive as a peacock.His decoration, his ornamentation is part of him, his life, his loins, his sin, his soul.In pursuit of Lolita, he was prepared to lie and deceive in order to achieve his goal.I don’t believe that he was prepared to lie to us, if only because there was no point in lying.When occasionally he questions the veracity of his own account, it is solely to question the accuracy of his memory.However, he didn’t need to tell lies to achieve leniency, he didn’t need to tell the truth for some ulterior motive.By confessing to anything, he would only be found guilty of crimes he hadn’t been charged with in addition to the charge of murder he had been accused of.There was no point in confessing to anything extra, other than to tell the truth as he saw it.It wasn’t going to get him any sympathy or reduce his penalty, if anything, his disclosures would aggravate his penalty.To this extent, I don’t consider Humbert an “unreliable narrator”.I realise that some might respond that paedophiles are habitual liars and can’t help themselves.That might well be the case, but I think it is our horror at his crime, our moral judgment affecting our assessment of the whole of the person and shaping our (aesthetic) response to the book and the character.Perhaps naively, I want to find some good in him.Ultimately, whether or not Humbert’s love was morally wrong, I believe that he wanted us to understand his love and what he learned about his love by the end of his story.What We Talk about When We Talk about Humbert’s LoveTechnically, the sexual relations between Humbert and Lolita are not an example of “paedophilia” (which is a sexual preference for a pre-pubescent).While nothing moral or legal turns on the distinction, the sexual relations constitute “hebephilia” (which is a sexual preference for a person in the early stage of puberty).The name derives from “Hebe”, the Greek goddess of youth.Her name means youth or prime of life, and she personified both youth and immortality.She was the cup bearer who served nectar to the Olympian Gods to give them everlasting youth.First Part (Obsessive Love)For me, during the first part of the book, Humbert’s love was forbidden, but genuine.It was a transgressive love, in that it was a love of the particular aesthetic form that youth takes between the ages of ten and fifteen.The body is at its most perfect, it has not started to age, to wrinkle, to fill out, to droop, to deteriorate.After that age, the body starts to age, and he finds that physically unattractive (as in the case of his first wife and Lolita's mother).OK, we all make choices about our love objects.How can we account for our choices?There’s no accounting for love.Still, at the heart of this aesthetic approach to love is a fear or disgust at aging and mortality.There is an unreality, a lack of understanding and acceptance of the cycle of life and death, a Peter Pan desire to stay forever young, forever immortal.I also think there is a self-love or narcissism inherent in this aesthetic view.I love the young, because I love the perfect form of my own youth.Since my youth, I have fallen, morally and physically.I therefore have to preserve the visage of my own youth.I wonder whether it is only possible to have this view if you have never had your own biological child.Parenthood is an education in the reality of aging.It is an illusion to believe that you can live and defeat it.But tell that to the cosmetics industry.So far I have talked of love in the abstract.In the first part of the book, I struggled to understand Humbert’s love and the above is what I came up with.I won’t say I had a sympathy for him, but I think I understood him and his love.I even understood his obsessiveness.How many of us, during the first throes of love, trap and oppress our love object, so much so that we are not able to see how oppressive we were, until after the relationship has been consummated, or morphed into something more mature or ended?However, things started to change at the end of the first part (the consummation) and into the second part (the imprisonment).Of course the love had to be consummated, but as unexceptional as the description of the event was, it highlighted the reality that the first part was a trap for Lolita to walk into.As playful and lyrical as the language might have been, it was sinister in intent.Second Part (Captivating Love)During the second part, having captured Lo, Humbert makes it clear that his love will last no more than three years, to be precise, 1 January, 1947 to 1 January, 1950, which are effectively her 12th to 15th birthdays.After this, statistically at least, Lo will morph out of her nymphet form.So Humbert's love is solely for a definitive phase of her entire life, after which he expects and intends to abandon her.During this phase, Humbert’s goal is to maintain Lolita in captivity, to ensure her availability for him alone. There is no fairy tale promise of “happily ever after” or “’til death do us part” in this love action.There is no love or concern for the other, only selfishness and narcissism.I have tried to view the definition of beauty that appeals to Humbert as an aesthetic issue.I have tried to divorce it from morality, so I can understand it better.However, whether I think of it in terms of aesthetics or morality, obsession or love, the fact that it could be switched on and off at such identifiable times turned me against Humbert.He is in control of this feeling called love, at least, he knows with clinical precision when he will return to “normality” or a state of not loving.His love was a drug that he took too knowingly, he knew precisely when the feeling of the drug would wear off.So, I started to believe that there was no loss of self in his love.Instead, it was a heightened or gross act of narcissism.By extension, there was no sense in which he tried to ""satisfy"" Lo personally or sexually.There was no sense of a mutually satisfying relationship or intercourse (although to be fair, he doesn't go into the sexual detail, except in terms of physical exertion).However, I got the sense that, when it came to consummating his love, it was just about sticking his dick into his love object.OK, lots of sexual relationships can be reduced to this fundamental penetrative act.Some men see femaleness as no more than a receptacle for maleness and its fluid manifestation, the cup into which they spill their seed.However, I started to feel in the second part that Humbert's aim was to defile or despoil the beauty that had appealed to him in the first part (even if it was transgressive).And the three year zone of enchantment highlighted to me that Humbert would just go in search of the next beautiful nymphet to stick his dick into.So it became increasingly apparent to me that he was a serial despoiler of beauty, not a genuine lover or admirer of beauty.There is a hatred or disgust hotwired into this love.You don't normally hate the flowers in your vase when it comes time to remove them and throw them in the dustbin.But you get the sense that Humbert would have been disgusted by his former love objects, his objet d'obsession, the moment that calendar clicked over.Obviously, this same disgust or loss of interest appears in more traditional relationships.It could lie behind the mid-life crisis when the guy runs away with the younger woman.It could explain the inability to accept the inevitability of aging, at least in our partner.It could explain we males who still picture ourselves as the immutable 20 year old who deserves a young and nubile partner (no matter how soft or old or fat or ugly we have become).So Humbert’s love can teach the rest of us something about our own love.Last Part (Adult Love Denied)I wrote most of my comments about the second part before I had finished reading the last part of the novel.I have to emphasise that most of what turned me against Humbert came from my reaction to his own words.Neither he nor Nabokov held back the material that would make me hate him.Still, I read on, firmly in their constrictive embrace, until chapter 29, when Humbert and the seventeen year old, married and pregnant Dolores meet again.What you think of Humbert and his love, whether or not you think he is lying, depends on your interpretation of the confessions in this chapter:“…there she was with her ruined looks and her adult, rope-veined narrow hands and her gooseflesh white arms, and her shallow ears, and her unkempt armpits, there she was (my Lolita!), hopelessly worn at seventeen, with that baby… and I looked and I looked at her, and knew as clearly as I know I am to die, that I loved her more than anything I had ever seen or imagined on earth, or hoped for anywhere else…“What I used to pamper among the tangled vines of my heart…had dwindled to its essence: sterile and selfish vice, all that I cancelled and cursed…“You may jeer at me, and threaten to clear the court, but until I am gagged and half-throttled, I will shout my poor truth.“I insist the world know how much I loved my Lolita, this Lolita, pale and polluted, and big with another’s child, but still gray-eyed, still sooty-lashed, still auburn and almond, still Carmencita, still mine.”This is just one part of Humbert’s journey.He realised that he still loved her outside the hebephile zone.However, he still clung to “his” Lolita, the Lolita of his deluded version of love.Obviously, Dolores is and never was “his” version of reality, she was her own person, and she declines his love a second time.Only then does he recognise that he “did not know a thing about [his] darling’s mind” or that “a North American girl-child named Dolores Haze had been deprived of her childhood by a maniac”.Then he quotes “an old poet” (presumably Nabokov himself):“The moral sense in mortals is the duty“We have to pay on mortal sense of beauty.”In other words, you can’t just indulge an aesthetic sense of beauty at the expense of a real human being, it comes attached to and constrained by morality.Morality, taboo and the law work together to protect innocence and beauty from those who would defile and despoil it.He was not above the law, he was no Nietzschian Superman.He was the fool in his own play.The TragedyThere are suggestions that Nabokov saw Humbert’s story as a tragedy, that Humbert only realised that he genuinely loved Dolores by conventional standards when it was too late.That might be so, but Humbert only had himself to blame.He was a victim of his own hand, and his tragedy was nothing compared with the one he made Dolores endure, so that he, too selfishly for love, could have his “Lolita”."
7607,Lolita,Vladimir Nabokov,3.88,523341,18382,"Ian ""Marvin"" Graye",5,"Between the CoversHaving just re-read ""Lolita"", I asked my local bookseller if she had ever read it.She replied firmly, “No…and I’m not going to either. He’s a paedophile.”A bit taken aback, I enquired further, “Who? The author or the character?”Fortunately, she replied, “The character.”For me, this exchange showed how much “Lolita” can still sharply divide opinion, even within lovers of fiction.This wasn’t the conversation I had been hoping for.I had read “Lolita” in a couple of days, less time than my work commitments normally allow me, but I found it incredibly easy to read.Even though I was taking notes, even though I was conscious that Nabokov was playing games (even if I didn’t always know what game), even though there were unfamiliar words I should have looked up, I was constantly drawn towards the conclusion.I wanted to talk to someone about my experience straight away.My cheeks were still flushed, my nerve endings were still tingling, I had experienced the “spine thrill of delight”, I felt like I had just had sex with a book.Now, not being a smoker, all I needed was some post-coital conversation.And there was no one around to converse with.And the book wasn’t giving away any more of its secrets than it already had.Nor was it going to tell me I had been a Good Reader or that it had appreciated my attentiveness.It was back between the covers, challenging me to start again.Three Act Word PlayAt a superficial level, “Lolita” is a relatively straight-forward novel.Once you know that it concerns sexual relations between 37 year old Humbert Humbert and 12 year old Dolores “Lolita” Hayes, you just about know the plot.There’s a beginning, a middle and an end.A grooming, a consummation, an aftermath.Nabokov makes of his material a three act play.And he does so playfully, seductively, lyrically, charmingly, amusingly, dangerously.To this day, I cannot look at Humbert’s initials “H.H.” without pronouncing them in German, “Ha Ha”, and wondering whether the joke is on us.Beneath the skin of the novel, there is much more.There is a whole complex living organism.You can lose yourself within its arms for days, weeks, months, a lifetime.As long as your love of wordplay, your love of words and play, will permit you.Again, at a superficial level, there is an almighty conflict between morality and aesthetics happening between the pages.Whether or not Nabokov deliberately put the conflict there, he put the subject matter there.We, the readers, can supply our own conflict in the way we read his novel.Nabokov knew the subject matter would inflame us, if not our desires, then at least our morals, our sense of righteousness.Morality and aesthetics are intertwined within the fabric of the novel.They embrace each other in one long death roll, just like Humbert Humbert and Clare Quilty.We watch their interaction, open-mouthed, open-minded, but ultimately they have to be pulled apart or separated.When they are together, they are one.When they are apart, they are each other’s double.The Morality of the StoryThere is no doubt that sexual relations between an adult and a minor are not just immoral, but criminal as well.That is an unquestionable fact.From a legal point of view, the motive of the adult is irrelevant to the proof of the crime.The consent of the minor is irrelevant to the proof of the crime.If Humbert had been charged with an offence of sexual relations with a minor, he would have had no legal defence.Any question as to whether Lolita really seduced Humbert would have been irrelevant.In fact, the evidence might not even have been admissible, except potentially as part of the determination of the penalty.In other words, even if it was relevant to penalty, it was not relevant to guilt.Because morality is a social construct that depends on collective endorsement, he had no moral defence either.The personal views of the individual are not really that relevant to society’s determination that an act is immoral.The choice of the individual is to comply or offend.Of Traps and CagesHumbert offended not just once, but untold numerous times over two years.He carefully planned his seduction, he set his trap, he caught his prey, even if someone might want to argue that this 12 year old seductress walked voluntarily into the trap.Having freed Lolita from the trap, he imprisoned her in a cage, and repeated his crime.Again, someone could argue that she had plenty of opportunities to flee the cage (which she eventually did).But Humbert surrounded Lolita with an elaborate system of self-doubt that convinced her that she would become a ward of the state if they were found out.The Legality of the Confession“Lolita” is written from Humbert’s point of view.It is not just a recollection in his mind, it is a formal, written document.He sat down and wrote it in 56 days between his capture in 1952 (charged only with the crime of murdering Clare Quilty) and his death in prison before his trial could occur.For me, the written document is a fascinating choice of literary device to tell the story.The document becomes a book within a book.While Nabokov obviously wrote it, all that he purports to do is sandwich it between a Foreword and a (much later) Afterword.This device sets up an interesting relationship between Humbert and the reader.For Humbert, it is akin to a confession or a witness statement.To this extent, what he confesses to is clearly enough to convict him of the crime of murder.However, in it, he also sets out details of crimes that, for whatever reason, he was never charged with.If his lawyer had read the document while he was still alive, he would probably have excised all of the other confessions, because they would have prejudiced his client’s case (at least with respect to penalty).The Role of the JuryFor the reader, the confession defines our relationship to the events that are described.We are cast in the role of a member of the Jury.This device allows heinous moral and criminal acts to be described and read and examined within a legal and therefore legitimate framework.In a sense, the book becomes a report of sorts on legal proceedings.We become legitimate observers and listeners to something that might otherwise have been prurient and offensive and illegal.Yet, we have to do our duty and participate in the legal process, because it is an important part of the justice system.Even though we have a legitimate interest in participating, I wonder whether we are still voyeuristic.Nabokov has trapped us in a game that persuades us that it is serious, but ends up being just as playful and perverse as the subject matter of the crime.In a way, Nabokov makes us complicit in a crime, if not Humbert’s crime, then perhaps our own thought crime.It is also material that, by the time Humbert’s confession is read, both Humbert and Lolita have died of natural causes.Humbert speaks from the other side of death.Nobody is alive, nobody can be hurt any more than they already have.The Confessions of an Unreliable Narrator (The Fox and the Peacock)I explored these issues, because I wanted to understand Humbert’s motivation for his confession.He is effectively pleading guilty.I don’t see any prospect for an insanity defence, even though he seemed to have been in and out of sanatoria at times of crisis.Equally, I don’t think that anything he reveals would reduce the penalty for the murder.To do so, he only needed to focus on his concern that Quilty had wronged Lolita in some way even worse than his own actions.But to confess all of these other crimes seems to be counter-productive.Similarly, I don’t think he was lying about the detail, I think that he was telling the truth, and that he was telling the truth, so that he could be understood, no more, no less.Humbert’s confession is not just the fiction of a dirty old man, it is not false or fabricated, it is not a mirage.No matter how immoral, no matter how deluded, no matter how selfish and narcissistic, it is his fact, his reality, his truth, his burden, his shame.His actions were the pursuit of a rational man, not an insane one.He was film-star handsome, educated, intellectual, talented, witty, charming, calculating, calculated, dangerous.There is no doubt that he was a talented performer, an exceptional player.However, Humbert is not an actor wearing a mask, performing some other fictional character or version of himself.I believe that we are seeing him for what he really is.He is as cunning, tricky, sly as a fox and as refined, elaborate, attractive as a peacock.His decoration, his ornamentation is part of him, his life, his loins, his sin, his soul.In pursuit of Lolita, he was prepared to lie and deceive in order to achieve his goal.I don’t believe that he was prepared to lie to us, if only because there was no point in lying.When occasionally he questions the veracity of his own account, it is solely to question the accuracy of his memory.However, he didn’t need to tell lies to achieve leniency, he didn’t need to tell the truth for some ulterior motive.By confessing to anything, he would only be found guilty of crimes he hadn’t been charged with in addition to the charge of murder he had been accused of.There was no point in confessing to anything extra, other than to tell the truth as he saw it.It wasn’t going to get him any sympathy or reduce his penalty, if anything, his disclosures would aggravate his penalty.To this extent, I don’t consider Humbert an “unreliable narrator”.I realise that some might respond that paedophiles are habitual liars and can’t help themselves.That might well be the case, but I think it is our horror at his crime, our moral judgment affecting our assessment of the whole of the person and shaping our (aesthetic) response to the book and the character.Perhaps naively, I want to find some good in him.Ultimately, whether or not Humbert’s love was morally wrong, I believe that he wanted us to understand his love and what he learned about his love by the end of his story.What We Talk about When We Talk about Humbert’s LoveTechnically, the sexual relations between Humbert and Lolita are not an example of “paedophilia” (which is a sexual preference for a pre-pubescent).While nothing moral or legal turns on the distinction, the sexual relations constitute “hebephilia” (which is a sexual preference for a person in the early stage of puberty).The name derives from “Hebe”, the Greek goddess of youth.Her name means youth or prime of life, and she personified both youth and immortality.She was the cup bearer who served nectar to the Olympian Gods to give them everlasting youth.First Part (Obsessive Love)For me, during the first part of the book, Humbert’s love was forbidden, but genuine.It was a transgressive love, in that it was a love of the particular aesthetic form that youth takes between the ages of ten and fifteen.The body is at its most perfect, it has not started to age, to wrinkle, to fill out, to droop, to deteriorate.After that age, the body starts to age, and he finds that physically unattractive (as in the case of his first wife and Lolita's mother).OK, we all make choices about our love objects.How can we account for our choices?There’s no accounting for love.Still, at the heart of this aesthetic approach to love is a fear or disgust at aging and mortality.There is an unreality, a lack of understanding and acceptance of the cycle of life and death, a Peter Pan desire to stay forever young, forever immortal.I also think there is a self-love or narcissism inherent in this aesthetic view.I love the young, because I love the perfect form of my own youth.Since my youth, I have fallen, morally and physically.I therefore have to preserve the visage of my own youth.I wonder whether it is only possible to have this view if you have never had your own biological child.Parenthood is an education in the reality of aging.It is an

2823,The Birth of Tragedy,Friedrich Nietzsche,3.97,9614,302,Glenn Russell,5,"With his vivid, passionate language, 19th century German philosopher Fredrich Nietzsche wrote his books as a way to pry open a space in a reader’s psyche, a space empowering an individual to embark on a journey of inner exploration. This is precisely why I think any attempt, no matter how well intended, to rephrase, paraphrase or synopsize Nietzsche, without including a fair amount of Nietzsche’s actual words, is a terrible injustice committed against one of the greatest literary stylists in the modern world. Thus I have included the below direct quotes from the first section of his book to allow Nietzsche, even in this brief review, to speak for himself. Please take my modest comments coupled with each quote as an invitation to explore this classic work on your own.“We shall have gained much for the science of aesthetics, once we perceive not merely by logical inference, but with the immediate certainty of vision, that the continuous development of art is bound up with the Apollonian and Dionysian duality – just as procreation depending on the duality of the sexes.” ---------- Nietzsche saw Greek tragedy as a prime example of how those ancient Greeks actually got it right; those ancients developed an accurate picture of the world as irrational, chaotic, primal Dionysian energy, energy that had to be softened, sweetened and otherwise contained by the Apollonian illusion of order, pattern and predictability (in a tragic play, such things as plot and character) to develop an art form acceptable to the public. The combination and balance of these two forces – chaotic Dionysian and orderly Apollonian – resulted in the Greek tragedy. “In order to grasp these two tendencies, let us first conceive of them as the separate art worlds of dreams and intoxication.” ---------- The two tendencies are the Apollonian and the Dionysian. The nature of the Apollonian is the dream that the world follows an ordered, harmonious, rational law; the nature of the Dionysian is the world as in the grip of chaotic, dark, vile, irrational forces. The type of art associated with the Apollonian would be Greek sculpture, such as marble statues of gods and goddesses portrayed as beings of great harmony, serenity and proportion. On the other hand, an example of the Dionysian would be a wild intoxicated nocturnal dance were the dancers are goaded into a frenzied swirl by a cacophony of deafening drums and flutes. “The beautiful illusion of the dream worlds, in the creation of which every man is truly an artist, is the prerequisite of all plastic art.” ---------- As frequently acknowledged, every child is an artist. Indeed, we all in our own way, beginning as children, create a picture world in our minds, featuring beautiful, fantastic illusions: breathtaking glass mountains, carefree, winged creatures soaring in the sky, elaborate castles, worlds of adventure and pleasure free of those irksome burdens such as sickness, hunger, disease, intense pain. It is these very marvelous, fanciful dreams that serve as the foundation for visual artworks created with paints and stone. Sidebar: It is this same artistic, imaginative tendency we all have that enables us to easily construct inner visual pictures as we read a work of fiction. Nietzsche would like us to extend our imaginative capacity, urging us to bring real style to our character and view ourselves as a work of art. “Philosophical men even have a presentiment that the reality in which we live and have our being is also mere appearance, and that another, quite different reality lies beneath it. Schopenhauer actually indicates as the criterion of philosophical ability the occasional ability to view men and things are mere phantoms or dream images.” ---------- Here Nietzsche is hinting at how philosophy beginning with Socrates and Plato, pushed the chaotic irrational forces of the universe to one side, even calling them phantoms or dream images. What truly matters in this view of the universe is reason. Reason is king. And since reason is at the heart of this philosophic conception of the universe, the very heartbeat of reality, why continue to have tragedy performed, an art form claiming chaos is at the heart of the universe? Nietzsche goes into great detail on how Socratic philosophy brought about the death of Greek tragedy. “Function of art: to give us a hint of a truth, a truth that the world was chaotic and meaningless but, equally, art had to shield us from this dark, dreadful reality.” ----------- This line of thinking is at the very core of why Nietzsche loved Greek tragedy: the tragic performance would give an audience a glimpse of the true nature of the world’s dark chaos but do it in a way via the dramatic art of plot, character and other theatrical devices to protect, to buffer and safeguard the audience so they could continue living and managing life in their society. “Thus the aesthetically sensitive man stands in the same relation to the reality of dreams as the philosopher does to the reality of existence; he is a close and willing observer, for these images afford him an interpretation of life, and by reflecting on these processes he trains himself for life.” ---------- As the philosopher uses logic, reason and analysis, so the aesthetically attuned person uses the dream-worlds of sleep, hallucinogens, the arts and creative imagination to explore different dimensions of experience. Nietzsche perceived the dark, chaotic forces of the universe as prominent, at the heart of the heart of life. He could see how these irrational forces could energize human experience rather than driving people down into hopeless despair and renunciation. “Either under the influence of the narcotic draught, of which the songs of all primitive men and peoples speak, or with the potent coming of spring that penetrates all nature with joy, these Dionysian emotions awake, or as they grow in intensity everything subjective vanishes into complete self-forgetfulness.” -----Here Nietzsche is alluding to our willing surrender of our sense of separate individuality to the swirl of joyful, ecstatic unity with the universe. In our modern world, one could think of a rave concert. Drugs and ecstasy, anyone? “In song and in dance man expresses himself as a member of a higher community; he has forgotten how to walk and speak and is on the way toward flying into the air, dancing. His very gestures express enchantment.” ---------- Taking the raw, primal energy and filtering it through Apollonian illusion. Here Nietzsche is suggesting art gives shape, form and color; art peddles a certain untruth since ultimately there is only the dark, irrational chaos. But this artistic untruth is completely necessary; otherwise, we couldn’t face the chaos. “The noblest clay, the most costly marble, man, is here kneaded and cut, and to the sound of the chisel strokes of the Dionysian world-artist rings out the cry of the Eleusinian mysteries: “Do you prostrate yourselves, millions? Do you sense your Maker, world?” ---------- A question worthy of consideration: Is tragedy a method and approach to life that actually works? Perhaps it is time for us modern people to reclaim the power and beauty of tragedy. *I would like to thank a number of contemporary British philosophers for their podcasts and books on Nietzsche’s philosophy of art and tragedy. Listened to their podcasts repeatedly and reading several of their books over the last few years has really deepened and enriched my understanding and appreciation for this exciting subject.

The second half is The Genealogy of Morals, which I will put off reading for the time being.Friedrich Nietzsche is like the butcher who rests his heavy thumb on the scales as he weighs his meat. In Greek tragedy, he detects two strains, the Apollonian, which is all light and reason, and the Dionysiac, which is more concerned with the terror, mystery and immanence of life. When he weighs the Dionysiac elements, Nietzsche positively leans on the scale. This results in some strange judgments, particularly when he attacks Euripides and Socrates as corrupters of the tradition perfected by Aeschylus and Sophocles and the old Greek religion.The author hails recent developments (in his day) in Germany, with Kant, Schopenhauer, and especially Wagner. What we know and Nietzsche did not was that his Dionysiac love fest ended in National Socialism and the horrors of World War II. His patent hatred of French and Italian art and culture gives his philosophy a purely intramural reach -- one which had later repercussions in the century to follow.My own feeling is that the Apollonian and Dionysiac both represent different attitudes toward life which are equally valid and perhaps necessary. If by his emphasis on Wagner's Liebestod, Nietzsche deprived himself of the joys of Cosi Fan Tutte and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and only hurt his own argument. Life contains both light and darkness, in roughly equal measure. On the other hand, I think Nietzsche created a fascinating dichotomy that has multiple uses that we have only begun to see in criticism and even  politics."
2822,The Birth of Tragedy,Friedrich Nietzsche,3.97,9616,303,Glenn Russell,5,"With his vivid, passionate language, 19th century German philosopher Fredrich Nietzsche wrote his books as a way to pry open a space in a reader’s psyche, a space empowering an individual to embark on a journey of inner exploration. This is precisely why I think any attempt, no matter how well intended, to rephrase, paraphrase or synopsize Nietzsche, without including a fair amount of Nietzsche’s actual words, is a terrible injustice committed against one of the greatest literary stylists in the modern world. Thus I have included the below direct quotes from the first section of his book to allow Nietzsche, even in this brief review, to speak for himself. Please take my modest comments coupled with each quote as an invitation to explore this classic work on your own.“We shall have gained much for the science of aesthetics, once we perceive not merely by logical inference, but with the immediate certainty of vision, that the continuous development of art is bound up with the Apollonian and Dionysian duality – just as procreation depending on the duality of the sexes.” ---------- Nietzsche saw Greek tragedy as a prime example of how those ancient Greeks actually got it right; those ancients developed an accurate picture of the world as irrational, chaotic, primal Dionysian energy, energy that had to be softened, sweetened and otherwise contained by the Apollonian illusion of order, pattern and predictability (in a tragic play, such things as plot and character) to develop an art form acceptable to the public. The combination and balance of these two forces – chaotic Dionysian and orderly Apollonian – resulted in the Greek tragedy. “In order to grasp these two tendencies, let us first conceive of them as the separate art worlds of dreams and intoxication.” ---------- The two tendencies are the Apollonian and the Dionysian. The nature of the Apollonian is the dream that the world follows an ordered, harmonious, rational law; the nature of the Dionysian is the world as in the grip of chaotic, dark, vile, irrational forces. The type of art associated with the Apollonian would be Greek sculpture, such as marble statues of gods and goddesses portrayed as beings of great harmony, serenity and proportion. On the other hand, an example of the Dionysian would be a wild intoxicated nocturnal dance were the dancers are goaded into a frenzied swirl by a cacophony of deafening drums and flutes. “The beautiful illusion of the dream worlds, in the creation of which every man is truly an artist, is the prerequisite of all plastic art.” ---------- As frequently acknowledged, every child is an artist. Indeed, we all in our own way, beginning as children, create a picture world in our minds, featuring beautiful, fantastic illusions: breathtaking glass mountains, carefree, winged creatures soaring in the sky, elaborate castles, worlds of adventure and pleasure free of those irksome burdens such as sickness, hunger, disease, intense pain. It is these very marvelous, fanciful dreams that serve as the foundation for visual artworks created with paints and stone. Sidebar: It is this same artistic, imaginative tendency we all have that enables us to easily construct inner visual pictures as we read a work of fiction. Nietzsche would like us to extend our imaginative capacity, urging us to bring real style to our character and view ourselves as a work of art. “Philosophical men even have a presentiment that the reality in which we live and have our being is also mere appearance, and that another, quite different reality lies beneath it. Schopenhauer actually indicates as the criterion of philosophical ability the occasional ability to view men and things are mere phantoms or dream images.” ---------- Here Nietzsche is hinting at how philosophy beginning with Socrates and Plato, pushed the chaotic irrational forces of the universe to one side, even calling them phantoms or dream images. What truly matters in this view of the universe is reason. Reason is king. And since reason is at the heart of this philosophic conception of the universe, the very heartbeat of reality, why continue to have tragedy performed, an art form claiming chaos is at the heart of the universe? Nietzsche goes into great detail on how Socratic philosophy brought about the death of Greek tragedy. “Function of art: to give us a hint of a truth, a truth that the world was chaotic and meaningless but, equally, art had to shield us from this dark, dreadful reality.” ----------- This line of thinking is at the very core of why Nietzsche loved Greek tragedy: the tragic performance would give an audience a glimpse of the true nature of the world’s dark chaos but do it in a way via the dramatic art of plot, character and other theatrical devices to protect, to buffer and safeguard the audience so they could continue living and managing life in their society. “Thus the aesthetically sensitive man stands in the same relation to the reality of dreams as the philosopher does to the reality of existence; he is a close and willing observer, for these images afford him an interpretation of life, and by reflecting on these processes he trains himself for life.” ---------- As the philosopher uses logic, reason and analysis, so the aesthetically attuned person uses the dream-worlds of sleep, hallucinogens, the arts and creative imagination to explore different dimensions of experience. Nietzsche perceived the dark, chaotic forces of the universe as prominent, at the heart of the heart of life. He could see how these irrational forces could energize human experience rather than driving people down into hopeless despair and renunciation. “Either under the influence of the narcotic draught, of which the songs of all primitive men and peoples speak, or with the potent coming of spring that penetrates all nature with joy, these Dionysian emotions awake, or as they grow in intensity everything subjective vanishes into complete self-forgetfulness.” -----Here Nietzsche is alluding to our willing surrender of our sense of separate individuality to the swirl of joyful, ecstatic unity with the universe. In our modern world, one could think of a rave concert. Drugs and ecstasy, anyone? “In song and in dance man expresses himself as a member of a higher community; he has forgotten how to walk and speak and is on the way toward flying into the air, dancing. His very gestures express enchantment.” ---------- Taking the raw, primal energy and filtering it through Apollonian illusion. Here Nietzsche is suggesting art gives shape, form and color; art peddles a certain untruth since ultimately there is only the dark, irrational chaos. But this artistic untruth is completely necessary; otherwise, we couldn’t face the chaos. “The noblest clay, the most costly marble, man, is here kneaded and cut, and to the sound of the chisel strokes of the Dionysian world-artist rings out the cry of the Eleusinian mysteries: “Do you prostrate yourselves, millions? Do you sense your Maker, world?” ---------- A question worthy of consideration: Is tragedy a method and approach to life that actually works? Perhaps it is time for us modern people to reclaim the power and beauty of tragedy. *I would like to thank a number of contemporary British philosophers for their podcasts and books on Nietzsche’s philosophy of art and tragedy. Listened to their podcasts repeatedly and reading several of their books over the last few years has really deepened and enriched my understanding and appreciation for this exciting subject.

2534,El Cuento de La Isla Desconocida,José Saramago,3.88,5611,511,s.penkevich,3,"‘Liking is probably the best form of ownership, and ownership the worst form of liking.Saramago had a gift for delivering such potent messages in such a simple manner, focusing a vast array of complex ideas into a simple parable that easily penetrates to your heart. His short story, The Tale of the Unknown Island is no exception, as is brought to even higher heights of fairytale-like beauty with the simple illustrations by Peter Sís. While it would have been best to include this in a collection of stories instead of sold on it’s own, this tale is a wonderful parable about looking for happiness and understanding the mysterious ways love works in our world.                    This story is classic Saramago with all of his talents and motifs on displays. Right away the reader is immersed in the political satire that fleshes out much of his work, as a man comes knocking at the King’s Door for Petitions. ‘Since the king spent all his time sitting at the door for favors (favors being offered to the king, you understand), whenever he heard someone knocking at the door for petitions, he would pretend not to hear’. The story takes off into a wonderful parable about finding happiness as the Man and a runaway cleaning woman, the only one to believe in the man’s quest, embark to discover an Unknown Island. Saramago’s language seems so simple, like a story aimed to be understood and enjoyed by all ages, yet carries a powerhouse of ideas and meaning in his seemingly unthreatening words. A message of love seems best delivered in such a pleasant way. This story caresses the heart and makes one feel the subtle magic of the world that echoes in the beauty of life all around us.The story, while being a joy to read, is a bit too short and feels as if it could have been much greater. There is a lengthy satirical buildup, yet, right when it seems the story could set off towards a wonderful adventure, the epiphany occurs and the story rapidly comes to an end. It is conclusive, but the message comes suddenly and made me wonder if it was originally intended to be a novella. Had he expanded on the ideas, I think this could have been a wonderful tale of double the length. Had this been included in a collection of short stories, the quick conclusion wouldn’t have felt so disappointing. Including this, perhaps, in Saramago’s The Lives of Things (that was a complete work, but I am unaware if Saramago had other short stories this could have been included with) would have given a more satisfactory feel to both that collection and this story. That said, this is still worth reading, and is very uplifting and enjoyable.The world lost a wonderful storyteller when Saramago passed in 2010. He had a unique style, and a sweet simplicity that reminds me of a more intellectual and literary version of Paulo Coelho. This story is a bit too light to stand on it’s own, yet is a satisfying trip into the warm, soothing places in Saramago’s heart. 3.5/5‘[W]e can’t see ourselves unless we become free of ourselves’          "
2535,The Stone Raft,José Saramago,3.79,4902,349,Kalliope,5,"As I was getting ready to travel around the Iberian Peninsula and fly to Porto, I pulled out this book detaching it from the bookshelves to which it belonged. Since it had been in my shelves for quite a few years, I dreaded that in its immobility it had petrified and that it had lost its nature as a book. But no, there it was, flexible as a thin stack of paper, and with the pages printed, ready for my eyes to scan its graphics. And ready for travel too.Saramago’s novel chronicles how the Iberian Peninsula, by detaching itself from the European continent along the middle of the Pyrenees departed on a journey, and narrates the wandering of a few Iberian individuals--both Portuguese and Spanish, around the floating Peninsula, no longer a geographic entity, but a huge stone floating and mobile raft.These individuals have been united in their shared perplexity at the extraordinary phenomenon, and by their suspicion that they are jointly but independently responsible, and in a most esoteric chain of eccentric causality, for the detachment of their countries from Europe. My edition is in Portuguese, although I had borrowed a Spanish version to keep on the side and help me in case I felt I was drowning in Portuguese (afogar – ahogar). But no, I floated in Portuguese (flutuar – flotar) and I enjoyed the different waters – less salty. And this wavering between the two languages was suitable, since Saramago, who obviously wrote it in his language, had settled in Spain (in Tenerife, one of the Canary islands). The book has many references and comparisons between the two languages using Spanish ones whenever he thinks they are more suitable, and Saramago rings the echoes of various Spanish and Portuguese literary figures. The wandering chevaliers are literary heirs of Don Quixote, and the featured donkey can only be named Platero Platero and I, and the characters have expressed concern about where Antonio Machado was buried. And of course there is Pessoa's shadow.Saramago was of the opinion that the two countries should be united and this was written when they entered the EEC on Janurary 1st, 1986. And that is the year when this novel was written.In his delightful and inimitable style Saramago concocts his idiosyncratic mixture of the absurd and the common sense. With his pen the absurd becomes common and the common sense has an absurd tone to it. What he calls the Insólito and the Sólito (and the latter is an invented word, and so his comparison becomes more goofy). This is Saramago’s stamp. Saramago, together with the story of his quixotic and diverse wanderers of this floating raft—which, in contrast to Odysseus, moves away from home rather than towards it, and in so doing distances itself from the Mediterranean as it advances West onto the Atlantic--, has also developed a parallel story-line with the geopolitical implications on an international scale. The balance of powers is dislocated as this floating island moves towards the Americas and Lisbon is getting ready to become a facing neighbor to Atlantic City. What are the responses of the other Europeans; what happens with Gibraltar; how the tensions between Canada and the US increase as the latter seems to be calling the shots in the new North-Atlantic allegiance... Or once it seems the stone raft is heading South, the concern of the US President with their missiles grounded in Iberia and whether they will have to deploy them against the penguins...And a long and rich and entertaining etcetera.But with all the wit, and the humour, and the irony and the absurdity, there is also a loving tone when addressing cherished human subjects, such as love, companionship and loyalty. And beneath all this absurdity on a geographical, political, personal level, there is the understated question of the nature of identity. And in this Saramago remains provocative. But that could be another review.------I dedicate this review to the citizens of Greece, hoping that they will not detach themselves from Europe."
4802,Tortilla Flat,John Steinbeck,3.82,35004,1803,Roddy,4,"I learned from this book that I continue to love Steinbeck. I despise the idea that he (like hemmingway for that matter) is sometimes considered a ""simple"" writer. Here's my opinion: Using flowery prose to add weight and impart meaning on a vaporous story is not great literature. A substantive story, containing meaning and moral, simply told IS great literature. This is what I run into every time I read Steinbeck. Hemmingway too. Simple construction - departing every so often to show off that yes, they know EXACTLY what they're describing - for the most part just recording the story as they would an event that really happened. They don't need a $2 word every couple paragraphs, they need maybe three per book. Besides, none of the characters would know the word, so why would you use it to describe them? What are you, better than your subject? I think the point Steinbeck constantly makes is - no, you're not. The characters are interesting and simply made, archetypes almost. I've heard its a Camelot tale and I can see it. They even use ""Thou"" and ""Thee"" in some parts. But it never seems heavy handed, you can almost see the characters realizing they're playing a part and stepping up to do it. Like Cannery Row, its about a lot of down on their luck guys, and the people of the town about them. Some richer, some poorer, all with their own little story. And Steinbeck seems to love the little side stories. Thankfully, he's so quick with his pen they're like brief tangents that come, then go once you've gotten the point of them. He never departs from our subjects for more than a couple pages, never spends 5 pages describing a rock or a particular tree, or even any of the men or the home they live in. A story that makes your throat tighten at the end, and makes you wish...well, you're supposed to read it. But the desire to keep things as they are is a very strong one in real life, Steinbeck makes you feel that desire and sense of loss in the little world he creates, and it takes him less than 200 pages to do it."

4799,Cannery Row,John Steinbeck,4.02,89889,3991,Jason,4,"Man, I love Steinbeck. I love the simplicity of his characters and the humdrum feeling their lives evoke. I love the indigence of his settings and the candidness with which these characters accept their conditions. I love how quietly he frames his stories with comments on fatalism, while still revealing to us the potential for happiness that pushes at its surface, trying to elbow its way out. At its core, the Steinbeck novel want us to figure out how to embrace the cards life has dealt us. It knows that the sooner we do, the sooner that happiness can become ours for the taking. It might be a fatalistic coin we’re being asked to pocket, but it’s a coin on which has been embossed a seal of optimism.But he certainly doesn’t make it very easy. The characters in his books are so far down the economic ladder you need a pair of binoculars to find them. And when you do spot them, you discover they are haggling over nickels and frogs. You almost want to step in and give them a Lowe’s gift card, just to make things a little easier for them. But Steinbeck characters don’t need your damn Lowe’s gift card. The point is not to move up that ladder; it’s to find comfort with the rung you’re already on. If they can recognize that, why can’t you?And that’s the thing about Steinbeckian characters: they often possess a deeper level of knowledge and understanding than their financial statuses—or their grammar—would otherwise suggest. There are also usually one or two who stand out from the rest for their capacity to grasp and relay human need. Where Ma Joad was just such a character in The Grapes of Wrath, it is Doc who lays it to us straight in Cannery Row. “The things we admire in men, kindness and generosity, openness, honesty, understanding and feeling are the concomitants of failure in our system. And those traits we detest, sharpness, greed, acquisitiveness, meanness, egotism and self-interest are the traits of success. And while men admire the quality of the first they love the produce of the second.”  Ruminating on the contradictory nature of being human, wherein one’s needs are in direct competition with one’s moral goals, Doc reminds us what’s worth appreciating about Mack and his Flophouse friends. Sure, they manipulate a situation for an advantageous edge if they can, and sure their idea of a party would make Clarissa Dalloway scream in mortified horror, but when all is said and done, they are honest with their friends and true to themselves in their dealings, and that is what makes their lives—at least that part of it—worth emulating.So keep your Lowe’s gift cards. They are not wanted here."
4806,Longitude: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time,Dava Sobel,3.95,42783,1949,Pramod Nair,4,"Longitude from Dava Sobel is a fascinating account of how a virtually unknown watchmaker named John Harrison conquered one of the oldest and thorniest problems surrounding the ocean voyages - the problem of accurately measuring longitude -, which stumped even the best of scientific minds for centuries. A fascinating problemIt was Ptolemy in ‘Geographia’, written in the 2nd century, who contributed the concept of a co-ordinate system based on the imaginary lines of latitude and longitude, for accurately plotting any spot on the surface of earth. With these imaginary lines he bought a new light in to the maritime explorations and map-making methods of his time. The sailors while at the ocean found it pretty straightforward to find their current latitude - which is drawn parallel to each other while girdling the globe – by measuring the height of the sun or any known celestial bodies. But accurately measuring their current longitude was an entirely different case, as the longitudinal lines loop from the North Pole to the South Pole and back again in great circles, which converge at the ends of the earth. Since it is an angular measurement, which is based on time, the sailors had to have access to two different times - the current time on-board the vessel and the time at a known and pre-selected longitudinal location – at the same instance for calculating the hour differences to work out the geographical separation and the longitude. From a modern viewpoint with our easy-to-carry accurate time-telling devices and instant communication this problem, which a sailor faced in finding the exact time at two different locations, may feel far-fetched. But a sailor in the middle of an ocean pre-dating 18th century only had limited resources in the form of either a pendulum driven clock which was not at all reliable – as the factors like gravity, motion of the vessel, temperature and atmospheric pressure affected the pendulum and there by the time – or by comparing positions of moon or planets like Mars with their anticipatory positions in working out the longitudinal values; both these methods were crude with a high level of inaccuracy.Since the days of Ptolemy, legendary scientific and exploratory minds like Amarigo Vespucci, Sir Issac Newton and Galileo Galilei did a lot of research into this matter but it took sixteen more centuries for mankind to finally invent a reliable solution for this problem.A tragedy & the declaration of a prize moneyIn 1707, a British fleet of vessels under Admiral Sir Clowdesley Shovell met with a tragic disaster as the result of miscalculations in their whereabouts leading to the sinking of four warships with a death toll of more than 1600 mariners. This disaster and huge protest from the merchants and seamen resulted in the formation of a parliamentary committee for finding a practical solution for the longitude problem. This was followed by the 1714 ‘Longitude Act’ by the parliament, which promised a prize money of £ 20,000 for a suitable solution. Dava Sobel covers this formation of the committee and the announcement of the reward in detail.Sir Issac Newton, who was consulted by the committee, at first suggested the idea of a ‘watch’ for tackling the longitude problem.“One method is by a Watch to keep time exactly. But, by reason of the motion of the Ship, the Variation of Heat and Cold, Wet and Dry, and the Difference of Gravity in different Latitudes, such a watch hath not yet been made.”But he believed that such a watch with too many technical challenges was not going to be a reality and was aligned more towards finding a solution for the longitude problem in the realms of astronomy. “A good watch may serve to keep a reckoning at Sea for some days and to know the time of a celestial Observation; and for this end a good Jewel watch may suffice till a better sort of Watch can be found out. But when the Longitude at sea is once lost, it cannot be found again by any watch.”Newton died in 1727, and therefore did not live to see the predecessor of the modern day chronometers become a reality. At the same time another less known figure; a skilled watchmaker from Lincolnshire named John Harrison who was stimulated by the scientific and the monetary factors surrounding this riddle decided to find a solution of his own. Possessed with a brilliant mind he succeeded initially in creating a prototype and then further versions of perfect working models of the world’s first marine-chronometers thereby revolutionizing the ocean travels. His handmade sea-clocks - which are elaborate pieces of engineering marvels and still in display in working condition at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, England - gave the world the first reliable method for measuring the longitude.Dava Sobel records the background and each step of this pioneering invention in an easy to read form, by guiding the reader through a tumultuous story of the sheer determination and relentless pursuit for perfection from a self made man and the obstructions, unkempt promises and villainy he had to face from some of his jealous contemporaries. This concise and engaging chronicle of an innovative engineering deed covers a lot of details on the history, science and politics, which led to this invention and is a recommended read for anyone who is interested in maritime history and science. Since I read an updated fully illustrated edition of ‘Longitude’, which was published later, the book was a treasure trove with a large selection of rare photographs - including Harrison's sea-clocks, documents of declarations, letters, scientific articles, maps and diagrams which added greatly to the value of the volume. The illustrated edition is highly recommended."
825,Zodiac,Neal Stephenson,3.7,14959,577,Kemper,4,"This book revolves around toxic waste being illegally dumped into Boston Harbor. While I was reading it, the water in the fish tank went mysteriously cloudy overnight despite being recently cleaned and our two goldfish who were like ten years old went belly up. So that was kind of creepy.The first Neal Stephenson book I read was Cryptonomicon and I jumped from there right into The Baroque Cycle and then the brain-busting brilliant behemoth that was Anathem. I loved them all, but saw frequent complaints from other Stephenson fans that he’d gotten boring and his books were too long. After reading Snow Crash last year and now Zodiac, I understand where they’re coming from. I’d politely disagree, but now I think I’ve got a better idea of why fans of earlier work are frustrated with Stephenson‘s later books. And oh by the way, his new novel coming out in September is over 1000 pages so I don’t think he’ll be scaling back any time soon.Sangamon Taylor is the ‘granola James Bond’, and a self-described professional asshole. A chemist who works for an environmental outfit that starts with the letter ‘G’, ST works tirelessly to stage flashy events that expose the illegal dumping of toxic waste and sometimes he gets a little more hands-on then just calling the media, but he refuses to cross the line into violence. His main area of expertise is all the illegal dumping into Boston Harbor, and he spends most of his time zipping around on his Zodiac boat charting the chemical levels, figuring out how it’s getting in the water, and then ripping the ass out of the corporation doing the polluting ST is cocky, smart and has the MacGyver-like mechanical skills to use toilet parts and salad bowls to block off a mile long underwater pipe being used to illegally dump toxins. ST’s crusade against the illegal waste dumpers of the Boston area eventually gets him mixed up with a conspiracy involving some extremely dangerous toxic waste and a presidential candidate.As usual, Stephenson is a bit ahead of his time in this book written in 1988. ST and his friends seem more like Gen X ‘90s then the New Wave ‘80s, and the book manages to avoid seeming dated despite the lack of cell phones and the Internet in the story. I loved the character of ST who seemed like a more foul mouthed version of one of the Mythbusters who has nothing but hatred for the soulless corporate yuppies and contempt for the spacey granola heads of the environmental movement who can’t do the simplest mechanical task. The schemes he cooks up are innovative and funny, and it was nice to have a main character who was genuinely trying to do something for the greater good without being either cynical or sanctimonious. I did get a few laughs out of ST’s strategies which usually involved exposure to the media and his confidence that public shaming was the way to force a giant corporation out of business. Oh, how quaint that seems when we all watched an oil company spill crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico on cable news daily for over two months and is still doing business as usual. This was a smart and funny ecological thriller that was way ahead of its time."
827,"The Diamond Age: or, A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer",Neal Stephenson,4.19,67368,2857,Chris,3,"I get the feeling that Stephenson's writing process goes something like this:Hey, I found a really cool idea here. I wonder what I can do about it....He then writes about 200 pages of really awesome, meticulous world-building, with innovative ideas about, in the case of this book, the possibly uses of nanotechnology and its eventual social ramifications, and then goes, Oh, damn, I'm writing a story, and high-tails it to the end of the book, leaving the reader a little wind-blown and confused. It happened in Snow Crash, where he was playing with the origins of language and the fundamental functioning of the human mind. It happened in Cryptonomicon, where he dove into the murky waters of cryptography and brought up brilliant gems, and it happened here, too.The Diamond Age is, fundamentally, about what would happen, or what might happen, if we really got nanotechnology working properly. How would society adapt if, suddenly, government became obsolete? With the Feed and the Matter Compilers able to create anything out of nothing, the entire economic and political underpinnings of the planet came undone, and people banded together into phyles. Like-minded individuals bonded with each other through shared values and morality, united only by a commonly upheld treaty which, in turn, rested on the new economy that nanotechnology allowed.Within one of the phyles, the Neo-Victorians, one of the more highly-placed Lords realized what was wrong with the world. The problem wasn't the corruption of values of which the old always accuse the young - indeed it was that those values were passed on too well. Children did not elect to join their phyles, they were indoctrinated into them from birth, which made them, well, boring.And so Lord Finkle-McGraw commissioned a great work - The Young Lady's Illustrated Primer to guide his granddaughter to a more interesting life. And had that been all that happened, the story would have been short. But two other copes of the Primer were made - one for the daughter of the book's designer, and another that fell into the hands of Nell, a young girl born into poverty and otherwise destined to lead a life of misery and sorrow.The Primer is a smart book, fully interactive, able to teach reading, science, history and martial arts, among other things. And what it teaches little Nell is how to be great.All of this is quite awesome - there's a great hunt for the Primer, plans within plans and all that. And then, suddenly, a new plot about a technology to supplant the Feed and some kind of Chinese revolution and the whole book runs off the rails.I know a lot of people love Neal Stephenson, and I can understand why. He's an incomparably imaginative man, who is able to find ways to express ideas that some of us couldn't even imagine. He's an heir to the world of that William Gibson and his contemporaries pioneered. He creates captivating worlds and characters and problems without simple solutions.He just keeps bollixing up the endings. Seriously, it's like a whole different story kicks in around page 250. I'm willing to read more of his works, though, in the hope that he's getting his act together...."
826,The Big U,Neal Stephenson,3.24,4416,208,Duffy Pratt,3,"At first I thought: ""Cool, it's Yossarian Goes to College."" And for a while, that's what this book felt like. Then, it either derailed or got on track, depending on how you look at it. Ultimately, the whole thing becomes a giant, but always fun, mess. There are alot of great parts here, and they are all jammed together in ways that might or might not make sense. From a pure plot standpoint, the various parts actually fit together pretty nicely -- but the way they fit, it feels like Stephenson has built something out of the game ""Mousetrap"". They all fit together like a bizarrely conceived puzzle, but none of them really seem to go together, except perhaps by the force of the author's will.But they are really cool parts: Stereo wars of Bach Organ works that hit upon the resonant frequencies of redundant skyscrapers; irradiated giant rats living in the sub-sewer systems; college frat boys who worship a neon sign; a clandestine nuclear waste facility; a computer virus that becomes a kind of overarching artificial intelligence... And these are just a smattering of the assorted craziness that forms the Big U. Ultimately, however, it seems to fall apart, as though Stephenson is a juggler running out of hands. But, even for its flaws, it was almost always fun and engaging. It lacks the diversions and infodumps that come in his later books. The characters are reed thin. The satire is so over-the-top that it becomes hard to even think of it as satire -- it's closer to pipe dreams. But there's plenty of humor and exuberance to pull through these weaknesses."
8247,"Constructing the Little House: Gender, Culture, and Laura Ingalls Wilder",Ann Romines,3.79,33,4,Jessica,1,"As a Little House fan and a history/ social/ cultural studies lover, I had high hopes for this book. I had always wondered about the story behind the Little House books, the culture and its views on gender at the time. I was quite disappointed. Some of the author's ideas were often extremely far-fetched and I found her arguments quite weak, backed up by few historical facts. I felt like the author read in between the lines excessively at times and twisted the evidence to support her preconceived arguments (instead of using the text/ evidence to arrive at her arguments). For instance the book suggests that there was an incestuous relationship between Laura and Pa and insists that straw stacks and guns in the LH books are phallic symbols!"
7744,"Captain Ahab Had a Wife: New England Women and the Whalefishery, 1720-1870",Lisa Norling,3.86,64,5,Sonya,4,"An excellent book for learning very detailed accounts of what middle-class women did while their husbands/fathers/sons went ""a-whaling"" during the 18th and 19th centuries. (However, I found it helpful to have read another book about whaling in general first.) Norling only covers the prime time of the whaling industry without going to much into why it stopped around 1870 and how it affected the women (and men). I would also have liked to know more about divorces or remarriage. When could a woman remarry if her husband had gone to sea and was gone for years (never knowing if he would return)? And if a husband came back and found his wife remarried, what happened? A look at the poorer sailors would have been good too, even though I realize this portion of the population is much harder to study. A lot of her focus was on the middle-class and of the wives of the captains. Would the ship owners, families, and social circles have been as supportive of the ""regular"" sailors?"
5413,'Salem's Lot: Illustrated Edition,Stephen King,4.25,75775,520,Wilier,3,"Vampiros con Stephen KingPara esta historia el autor no esconde que fue directamente inspirado por Drácula de Bram Stoker y que su intención incicial fue la de rehacer esta novela con un ambiente americano preguntándose que hubiera pasado si el conde hubiera viajado a un pequeño pueblo de maine en vez de Londres. Como resultado tenemos una historia que tiene muchos de los rasgos mas evidentes del estilo de Stephen King con ingredientes para seguir la linea de la tan famosa novela de Stoker.El intento fue hacer los vampiros seres menos elegantes y hacerlos mas grotescos e inhumanos, en mi opinión lo logra pero no dejando muy buenas sensaciones desde mi punto de vista. La imagen pulcra, señorial y aristócrata de Drácula es uno de los ganchos de Stoker, haciendo que sus victimas no sólo se sientan aterrorizadas sino también atraídas en primera instancia por la personalidad tan fuerte del conde... Tal fue el caso de Jhonatan Harker. En este caso tenemos a Barlow, un vampiro bastante caricaturizado, sus motivaciones son absolutamente malignas, juntamente con su aspecto, tiene poca participación en la trama, siendo un bicho raro que hay que cazar y matar, lo cual claramente fue la intención de King.Hay elementos que vemos del Stephen King ochentero, vemos como el pueblo comienza a comportarse en su ya clásico inconsciente colectivo que suele trasmitir en sus novelas, vemos como impersonifica al villano transformándolo en una cosa (Este libro le pide a gritos a Stephen King que lo deje y comience a escribir IT). Como resultado tenemos una buena historia, bastante entretenida, no la mejor del autor pero si una de las mas importantes.Se nota mucho que es una historia previa a la época de oro del autor.Cabe destacar que aunque es su segundo libro publicado es uno de los primeros que escribió."
7741,Gulliver's Travels,Jonathan Swift,3.55,190477,4039,Stephen,3,"Let’s face it…. Jonathan Swift was a snarky, snarky bitch. Gulliver’s Travels is like a giant  pimp slap across the human race face and I am so glad I finally read this in a non-school, non-structured environment because I had a whole lot more fun with it this time around. Swift’s wit, insight and delivery are often, though not always, remarkable and he crams more well thought out jabs and toe-steppings in this slim 250 page novel than I would have thought possible in a work twice this long.   This is certainly a classic that I believe people should read and experience for themselves outside of any required scholarly endeavors because I think that many of the ills, injustices and idiocies that Swift addresses in this novel are still, unfortunately, very relevant today. While Swift is short on resolutions or ideas for improvement (one of my disappointments) he does a marvelous job of exposing the problems that he perceived as existing within the 18th Century world, most particularly England, and opening the door for a more expansive, popular discussion on these issues.Kudos for that, Mr Swift.  From a plot perspective, Gulliver’s Travels is a series of adventures by Lemuel Gulliver to various undiscovered, fictional worlds that act as a backdrop for Swift, through his main character/mouthpiece, to scathe, rebuke, poke fun at and/or question all manner of political, religious  and social institutions, philosophies and groups. Everything from blind adherence to political ideologies or religious dogma, to ideological intolerance, to arbitrary social divisions and even the non-practical aspects of the rampant scientific explorations so in vogue at the time. Few groups were spared from Swift's caustic lens and many of his attacks are vehement bordering on brutal. Good. That is how such a work should be IMHO.  Overall, I thought this was very worthwhile and many of Swift’s commentaries were piercing,  brilliant and exceptionally well done. Some of my personal favorites include:  ** Parodying the massive waste of energy and resources expended in political infighting in Great Britain between the Whigs and Tories by having the two Lilliputian political parties separated solely by the aesthetic choice between wearing high heels and low heels. I can only imagine how this parody played out among the MP of England at the time.  ** Making light of the tremendous importance placed on seemingly trivial differences in religious doctrine that often lead to the most acrimonious wars and civil strife by explaining that the genesis of a long and bloody war between rival factions of Lilliputians stems from a disagreement over where to crack eggs. One group break their eggs on the small end (Small Endians) and the other break their eggs on the large end (Big Endians). What I found most clever about this attack was the use of an ambiguous reference in each side's “holy book” that states, “all true believers break their eggs at the convenient end.” That is just about perfect satire Mr. Swift. ** A biting jab at traditions and customs that people cling to long after there is no practical reason to do so is eloquently made when Gulliver describes the Lilliputians custom of burying their dead head first.    They bury their dead with their heads directly downwards, because they hold an opinion that in eleven thousand moons they are all to rise again, in which period the earth (which they conceive to be flat) will turn upside down, and by this means they shall, at their resurrection, be found ready standing on their feet. The learned among them confess the absurdity of this doctrine, but the practice still continues, in compliance to the vulgar. 
 When Swift is on his game, he is very, very effective.** A wonderful anti-war statement is made through the horror and disgust with which the King of the giant Brobdingnagians (their size depicted as representing moral superiority) reacts to Gulliver’s description of gunpowder and his offer to teach the Brobdingnagians the formula for producing it: 
   I told him of ‘an invention, discovered between three and four hundred years ago, to make a certain powder…[t]hat a proper quantity of this powder…would drive a ball of iron or lead, with such violence and speed, as nothing was able to sustain its force. That the largest balls thus discharged, would not only destroy whole ranks of an army at once, but batter the strongest walls to the ground, sink down ships, with a thousand men in each, to the bottom of the sea, and when linked together by a chain, would cut through masts and rigging, divide hundreds of bodies in the middle, and lay all waste before them. That we often put this powder into large hollow balls of iron, and discharged them by an engine into some city we were besieging, which would rip up the pavements, tear the houses to pieces, burst and throw splinters on every side, dashing out the brains of all who came near…...The king was struck with horror at the description I had given of those terrible engines, and the proposal I had made. ‘He was amazed, how so impotent and groveling an insect as I…could entertain such inhuman ideas, and in so familiar a manner, as to appear wholly unmoved at all the scenes of blood and desolation which I had painted as the common effects of those destructive machines; whereof,’ he said, ‘some evil genius, enemy to mankind, must have been the first contriver.’ As for himself, he protested, that although few things delighted him so much as new discoveries in art or in nature, yet he would rather lose half his kingdom, than be privy to such a secret; which he commanded me, as I valued any life, never to mention any more.
 Sorry for the long quote, but I thought that was a particularly moving passage. ** My personal favorite (purely from an enjoyment standpoint) is the depiction of the scientifically adept and common-senseless Laputans  who exemplify Swift’s serious gripe against scientific research that doesn’t have a practical and foreseeable benefit to society. 
  The first man I saw was of a meagre aspect, with sooty hands and face…[H]e has been eight years upon a project for extracting sunbeams out of cucumbers, which were to be put in phials hermetically sealed, and let out to warm the air in raw inclement summers. He told me, he did not doubt, that, in eight years more, he should be able to supply the governor’s gardens with sunshine, at a reasonable rate….
 Gulliver’s exploration of the scientific academy of Laputa was my favorite part of the novel and I thought Swift’s satiric chops were at there sharpest in relaying the societal dysfunction of the Laputans.  Now I must drop some ice in the bath water. As much as there was to enjoy in this work, I was not as blown away by it as I would have liked to have been. For one thing, I thought that Swift’s prose was merely serviceable and I didn’t find much in the way of eloquence in his delivery. It was missing the ear-pleasing lyrical quality that I have come to expect when reading classic literature. The writing wasn’t bad by any means but it wasn’t as enjoyable or memorable as I had hoped. This may be an unfair critique given that this book’s legacy lies with its content, but the lack of beautiful prose kept me from being able to enjoy the interludes and non-meaty passages of the work.    Also, some of Swift’s critiques fell a bit flat and didn't resonate with me as much as those mentioned above. For instance, the recasting of famous historical figures like Alexander, Hannibal and Caesar as being more subject to the moral frailties of the human animal than the established texts would have us believe. Swift uses this as the springboard to discuss the less than wholesome practices of securing political power today and that is a good thing. I just found the use of the legends of antiquity unnecessary and not particularly effective. That’s probably a personal bias of mine as I have always found those figures fascinating to read about.    Here's my biggest problem. One of the principal arguments that Swift makes in his novel is that balance and moderation are the keys to success both individually and as a people. Extremes of behavior and belief are the seeds from which disastrous consequences are born, according to Swift. That’s easy to say and it has an attractive ring to it, but I wish Swift had done a little more with it. This walkmy right into my biggest complaint about the story…the ending. I thought that the ambiguity of Gulliver’s condition at the end of the novel was a bit of a cop out. It appears as though the reader is left to determine whether Gulliver was (1) a man disgusted with humanity as a result of his exposure to the morally righteous and logically rational Houyhnhnm or (2) a man whose ill-conceived and intemperate worship of, and infatuation with the Houyhnhnm made him just another unbalanced yahoo whose loss of perspective and left him deranged.   Part of the answer of this would stem from determining whether Swift was holding up the Houyhnhnms as a model to follow or whether their own passionless adherence to logic was itself a subject of parody. However, as with the end, I think Swift was less than certain of his position (or of the position he wanted to state) and thus left too much ambiguity to the reader. Now I understand that often these kinds of soft endings are perfect as they allow the reader to interpret the work for themselves. However, here where Swift has been bludgeoning the reader with his opinions throughout the entire work, to suddenly punt and not clearly express a case for his protagonist seems to be a miss. That said, I am the first to acknowledge that it is anywhere from a distinct possibility to a metaphysical certainty that the “miss” here is on my part, but that was how I saw it. I wanted Swift to wrap up and summarize the effect of the journey on Gulliver and provide a statement about what should be drawn from his experience so that a better road could be paved for using his travels to address the problems on which it shined its light.   3.0 to 3.5 stars. Still…HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"

It was very straight forward, and to the point, but clear and easy to read for early readers.  They really only gave half (or less) of the real story (I kind of found that a bummer) but I guess they wanted to keep it short for little kids. Okay.  So, overall, if you are an early reader, this would be great for your first version of Gulliver's Travels (unless you have someone to read the first book for you, then you should just let them read it to you and leave this for only children. ).  Happy Reading!  Hero "

7746,Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and Other American Stories (Modern Library),Hunter S. Thompson,4.21,1738,86,Jeffrey Keeten,3,"“No sympathy for the devil; keep that in mind. Buy the ticket, take the ride...and if it occasionally gets a little heavier than what you had in mind, well...maybe chalk it off to forced conscious expansion: Tune in, freak out, get beaten.”  When I was attending college at the esteemed institution of the University of Arizona I scored a ticket to see Hunter S. Thompson. My book friends were green with envy or it could have just been the pallor left over from the drinking bout the night before. Anyway they all looked at me with that glint in their eye as if I was in for a potentially perverted experience like going to a strip club with flying monkeys or a backroom orgy with nuns. They were all excited for me and I was feeling a little taller and a little more sassy knowing that I was going to come away from the event a changed man. He didn't show.It would have been so much more interesting if I could have said he had staggered out on stage and blew chunks all over the front row of attendees. I was okay with that because I was no where near the front. Or if he had shown up intoxicated terminating the event with a spectacular 360 degree fall into the crowd. I didn't ever get my ticket cost back. They offered, but one thing or another always got in my way actually getting my money back.That is the closest I came to actually breathing the same fetid air as Dr. Duke.   Okay I got to say first of all this is a silly, silly book. I had many moments when I wondered why I was reading it at all...well...it might have been because of all those other times when I caught myself snorting with laughter. Thompson called this book a failed experiment, ""a style of 'reporting' based on William Faulkner's idea that the best fiction is far more true than any kind of journalism."" This book is one of best examples of Gonzo Journalism. Below is the Wikipedia explanation. ""Gonzo journalism is a style of journalism that is written without claims of objectivity, often including the reporter as part of the story via a first-person narrative. The word 'gonzo' is believed to be first used in 1970 to describe an article by Hunter S. Thompson, who later popularized the style. The term has since been applied to other subjective artistic endeavors."" Synopsis: The journalist Raoul Duke is asked to report on the outcome of the Mint 400 motorcycle race in Las Vegas. He brings his 300+ pound Samoan attorney, Dr. Gonzo along for the ride. Reporting on the race is soon abandoned as the duo begin experimenting with a cornucopia of recreational drugs. LSD, marijuana, cocaine, mescaline, ether, a pineal gland abstract drug (whoa!!), uppers, downers and all washed down with copious amounts of alcohol. The book is one drug inspired adventure after another. The cocktail of illegal pharmaceutical use brings on imaginary flying bats dive bombing their heads, car crashes, and general mayhem perpetration on the tourists of Las Vegas. 
  The artwork of Ralph Steadman really enhanced the experience of reading the book. I have a copy of Animal Farm illustrated by Steadman and in both books he presents a mind bending VISION of events. The splatter of his brush and the drug altered expressions on the faces of the Fear and Loathing characters gave me several chuckles, but also deepened my impression of how really whacked out these guys were. They do as the novel progress start to get a handle on the hallucinations.""Hallucinations are bad enough. But after a while you learn to cope with things like seeing your dead grandmother crawling up your leg with a knife in her teeth. Most acid fanciers can handle that sort of thing."" And offer sage advice. ""One of the things you learn, after dealing with drug people, is that everything is serious. You can turn your back on a person, but never turn your back on a drug--especially when it's waving a razor-sharp hunting knife in your eyes.""
  Look into my EYE...Give me your drugs...Look into my EYE...Do you have more drugs?...Look into my EYE...Find me more drugs.I do wish that Hunter S. Thompson had shown up for the event. When I was younger I always felt there would be another chance to do everything, but as I've gotten older I've come to realize that we don't get as many opportunities as we think. Thompson may not have been one of my favorite writers, but he was a dynamic personality and he was always an on going story. “Too weird to live, too rare to die!” Well he did die, but he will certainly never be forgotten."

9627,The Illustrated Man,Ray Bradbury,4.13,58960,2699,Lyn,4,"I read a review once that described Robert A. Heinlein as a creepy old uncle who drinks too much at parties and who makes embarrassing comments, but who everyone likes in spite of his outdated ways – kind of a loveable rogue. Ray Bradbury, similar but by contrast, is like the dotty old professor whom everyone cannot help but love and who overlook his eccentricities. His stories are as warm and imaginative as a summer afternoon. And all due respect to Fahrenheit 451, which is a fine novel, but I submit that Bradbury’s great contribution to literature arises from his short stories, he is a master of the medium. And just as Heinlein, Asimov and Clarke are the “Big Three” and are the masters and founders of modern science fiction, Bradbury is an atavist, a throwback to Wells and Jules Verne and Edgar Rice Burroughs – he is our last link to a simpler time, before the age of information, before everything was required to be explained in scientific detail. Where Heinlein will go into great detail to explain the mathematical elements of a hyperspace warp drive and how it affects the space –time continuum, Bradbury would simply write, “and they got in the rocket and went to Mars.” Beautifully simple and imaginative. And, let’s just get it out on the table – what about Mars? I think that to Bradbury, Mars was not just the fourth planet, Mars was a representative of “another place”. Mars was the “out there”, was Bradbury’s Neverland, his Wonderland.The Illustrated Man is a collection of short stories, many that take up from the The Martian Chronicles with his fascination with Mars as an alternate reality, loosely connected with a centerpiece of a tattooed carnival worker whose body art moves and shifts and tells stories. Wonderfully imaginative, quintessential Bradbury."

3961,The Fall of Hyperion,Dan Simmons,4.18,70225,2338,Kemper,5,"""Nurse, this patient’s chart is very confusing.”“Which patient, Doctor?”“Uh..Mr. Kemper. He’s the one in the vegetative state.”“Oh, that’s a very sad and odd case.”“According to the patient history, he was admitted a few weeks ago with cerebrospinal fluid leaking from his nose and ears, but it seemed like he should recover. But yesterday he was brought in again, barely conscious and then he lapsed into a coma. The really odd thing is that I see no signs of injury or disease.”“That’s right, Doctor. It was a book that did this to Mr. Kemper.”“A book? How is that possible?”“From what we can figure out, the first incident occured after he read Hyperion by a writer named Dan Simmons. I guess it’s one of those sci-fi books and apparently the story is quite elaborate. Anyhow, Mr. Kemper had read Simmons before and knew he likes to put a lot of big ideas in his books. But this time, apparently Simmons broke into his house and managed to directly implant much of the book directly into Mr. Kemper’s brain via some kind of crude funnel device.”“I find that highly unlikely, Nurse.”“Most of us did, Doctor. But Mr. Kemper kept insisting that Simmons had some kind of grudge against him. He even had a note he said Simmons had left that said something like ‘Don’t you ever learn? If you keep reading my books, I’ll end you someday.’”“Assuming that I believed this story, I guess that Kemper’s current state tells us that he didn’t heed the warning?”“Apparently not, Doctor. His wife said she found him having convulsions and leaking brain matter out his nose and ears again. A copy of the sequel, The Fall of Hyperion was on the floor nearby.”“I can’t believe that reading a silly sci-fi book could turn an healthy man into a turnip, Nurse.”“Well, when they brought Kemper in, he was semiconscious and muttering. Someone wrote it down. Let see, he kept repeating words and phrases like: Shrike, Time Tombs, the Core, God, uh…no, two gods actually, farcasters, Ousters, religion, pope, death wand, space battles, interplanetary trees, old Earth, AI, mega sphere, data sphere, The Canterbury Tales, poetry, John Keats, Tree of Thorns, and Lord of Pain.”“Jesus! What does all that mean?”“Someone looked it up on the web and all of that is actually in the book.”“That poor bastard. No wonder his gray matter is fried. No one could absorb all that without permanent damage.”“Yes, I’d think that book should have some kind of warning sticker or something on it.”“One thing I still don’t understand, Nurse. If Kemper knew that this book would probably do this to him, why did he still read it?”“I guess he had told several people that Hyperion was just so good that he had to know how it ended, even if it killed him.”***************************************I think the word ‘epic’ was invented to describe this book.What Simmons began in Hyperion finishes here with a story so sprawling and massive that it defies description. In the far future, humanity has spread to the stars, and maintains a web of worlds via ‘farcasters’. (Think Stargates.) On the planet Hyperion, mysterious tombs have been moving backwards in time and are guarded by the deadly Shrike.Seven people were sent to Hyperion on a ‘pilgrimage’ that was almost certainly a suicide mission, but the Ousters, a segment of humanity evolving differently after centuries spent in deep space, are about to invade. The artificial intelligences of the Core that humanity depends on for predictions of future events and management of the farcaster system can’t tell what’s coming with an unknown like the Shrike and Hyperion in play.Battles rage across space and time and the virtual reality of the data sphere as varying interests with competing agendas maneuver and betray each other as the pilgrims on Hyperion struggle to survive and finally uncover the secrets of the Shrike. But the real reasons behind the war and it’s ultimate goal are bigger and more sinister than anyone involved can imagine.I can’t say enough good things about the story told in these first two Hyperion books. This is sci-fi at it’s best with a massive story crammed with big unique ideas and believable characters you care about. Any one of the pieces could have made a helluva book, but it takes a talent like Simmons to pull all of it together into one coherent story."
6496,8 Minutes in the Morning for a Flat Belly,Jorge Cruise,3.6,77,7,Judith Ann Kohnen,5,"This is an easy read and very informative - packed with smart eating and exercise. Especially helpful for busy people who have little time to focus on themselves. Though somewhat repetitive in places, I needed repetitive, kept me focused on some important areas. The exercises in this book are simple and doable and now a part of my daily routine. It's not just for belly either - no! Four exercises a day just Monday through Friday, plus one minute of running in place, and 3 minutes of stretching (you break on Saturday & Sunday, except for the suggested food options) - Jorge Cruise has provided me the simplest way to do a TOTAL workout for my week. In as little as 15 minutes, I'm done each morning and can start my day revved up and ready for all my tasks. It's quick, easy, and not only am I seeing results, I'm feeling them! I have more motivation, more energy and I feel stronger. Of course this means I have to be more conscious about what I put into my mouth on a daily basis, but we all should be doing this. The crazy part is, it replaces hours at the gym and I'm actually getting better results. I would recommend this book to everyone. I'd also suggest surfing the net for essential foods that support liver function (which break down our fat!) and those foods that detoxify our bodies. Those that support our brain function too.

1066,Shibumi,Trevanian,4.22,9960,669,Jeffrey Keeten,4,"The reading public back in 1979 picked this book up thinking they were reading a best selling thriller novel, little did they know they were going to be exposed to a Trevanian philosophy called SHIBUMI. “SHIBUMI has to do with great refinement underlying commonplace appearances. It is a statement so correct that it does not have to be bold, so poignant it does not have to be pretty, so true it does not have to be real. SHIBUMI is understanding, rather than knowledge. Eloquent silence. In demeanor, it is modesty without prudency. In art, where the spirit of SHIBUMI takes the form of SABI, it is elegant simplicity, articulate brevity. In philosophy, where SHIBUMI emerges as WABI, it is spiritual tranquility that is not passive; it is being without the angst of becoming. And in the personality of a man, it is…authority without domination. One does not achieve SHIBUMI, one…discovers it. And only a few men of infinite refinement ever do that. One must pass through knowledge and arrive at simplicity to arrive at SHIBUMI.”I've seen reviewers say that this book is too intelligently written to be published today. A bit cynical in my opinion, the book is a product of the time, but certainly doesn't come across as a typical written by-the-numbers thriller. Written today it would obviously be written differently. Probably some of the more defining aspects of the book would be lost, but I still think this book would make the spring list of a major publisher. The first part is about Nicholai Hei's upbringing in Shanghai and Tokyo. He was born to an exiled Russian countess and a German soldier. His mother does whatever she needs to do to survive as territory changes hands and new armies march into town. Luckily for Hei his mom has the good fortune to snag a Japanese General, Kishikawa,who takes a shine to the boy. He arranges for Nicholai to be sent back to friends who can further his teachings in the Japanese philosophy game of GO. Nicholai has a natural ear for languages and learns five. As the world destabilizes and the Americans and the Russians start competing for trophies, Nicholai finds himself without a country. His one asset is his knowledge of languages. He takes a job working for the Americans even though he loathes them. The book is filled with pointed criticisms of all nationalities, but Trevanian's favorite target is the Americans.  ""It was not their irritating assumption of equality that annoyed Nicholai so much as their cultural confusions. The Americans seemed to confuse standard of living with quality of life, equal opportunity with institutionalized mediocrity, bravery with courage, machismo with manhood, liberty with freedom, wordiness with articulation, fun with pleasure – in short, all of the misconceptions common to those who assume that justice implies equality for all, rather than equality for equals.""Hei commits an act that brings him under the control of the CIA. The accusations that are thrown at him reminded me of 2008 when then Senator Obama was running for President and people were holding up signs with a Hitler mustache under his nose and accusing him of being a Stalinist. I kind of felt they needed to pick whether he was a Nazi or a Communist. It is really hard to be both. ""If I understand you, Major-and frankly I don't much care if I do-you are accusing me of being both a communist and a Nazi, of being both a close friend of General Kishikawa's and his hired assassin of being both a Japanese militarist and a Soviet spy. None of this offends your sense of rational probability?""Hei is subjected to devastating torture while in the hands of the Americans and this treatment sets him on his course of being an international assassin for hire and a level four master of sexual intercourse. Yes, in this novel there are four levels of sexual aptitude and I am not going to speculate as to where I fall on the spectrum. The first part of the novel is really good, but I really liked the second part because we get to meet Hei's friends. We find Nicholai living in a chateau in the Basque region of France.   His best friend is Beñat Le Cagot a self made man, a Basque poet who has an ego larger than Donald Trump only expressed with much more intelligence. He is randy, fun loving, and a spelunking companion for Hei. He likes expressing himself with colorful language such as ""By the Two Damp Balls of John the Baptist.""A typical conversation Hei always has to endure Le Cagotisms. ""Is everything laid out?""Does the devil hate the wafer?""""Have you tested the Brunton compass?""""Do babies shit yellow?""And you're sure there's no iron in the rock?""""Did Moses start forest fires?""""And the fluorescein is packed up?""""Is Franco an asshole?""Hei takes this all in stride, but I found myself snorting out loud several times at the Le Cagot wit. Trevanian must have had a giggle or two coming up with some of the Le Cagot expressions. Needless to say Hei becomes enmeshed with a situation counter to American interests. He enlists the aid of his other friend ""The Gnome"" a dwarf (Peter Dinklage?) and a world class blackmailer who has the means to bring governments to their knees. Body counts rise quickly, and in the course of his chess match with the Americans he realizes he has much more to lose than his life philosophy would ever have him admit. The book is at times over the top, spoofish, but the real brilliance of the book is the ability to read it on whatever level you want. If you want to take it to the beach as a mind diverting entertainment it will deliver. If you want to read it and let your mind toss around the aspects of the philosophy of Shibumi that is also quite easily done. Either approach to the book will garner enjoyment. Highly recommended and if I write much more I'm going to convince myself to bump it from four to five stars. I want to leave you with a summary of Hei's view of American culture. ""It's not Americans I find annoying; it's Americanism: a social disease of the postindustrial world that must inevitably infect each of the mercantile nations in turn, and is called 'American' only because your nation is the most advanced case of the malady, much as one speaks of Spanish flu, or Japanese Type-B encephalitis. It's symptoms are a loss of work ethic, a shrinking of inner resources, and a constant need for external stimulation, followed by spiritual decay and moral narcosis. You can recognize the victim by his constant efforts to get in touch with himself, to believe his spiritual feebleness is an interesting psychological warp, to construe his fleeing from responsibility as evidence that he and his life are uniquely open to new experiences. In the later stages, the sufferer is reduced to seeking that most trivial of human activities: fun."" "

4492,Le Journal de Bridget Jones,Helen Fielding,3.75,762598,8227,April (Aprilius Maximus),1,"Prepare yourselves, it's about to get personal up in here.So, I've never seen the movie of Bridget Jones's Diary, so I thought I would read the highly acclaimed book before doing so and, to my great surprise, I ended up hating almost everything about it. I 100% understand why people like it - it's funny and relatable and reminiscent of the great decade that was the 90's, but because of a purely personal problem, this book made me feel like garbage and therefore made me absolutely loathe my reading experience. Bridget is always writing down her weight and saying she's fat, but the thing is, it's not just herself saying this. Friends, family and other characters also call her fat throughout the novel and then I look at me, who weighs over 15 kilos more than Bridget, and it honestly made me feel like crap. I have already been struggling with confidence and self-loathing because over the past couple of years I've put on 25 kilos due to changing medications for my mental health, so this book honestly just made it worse. Is this what people on the street think about me when I walk by? Do my friends and family secretly discuss how much weight I've put on behind my back? It honestly took me back to when members of my own family were making snide remarks about my weight or offering suggestions for how exercise and dieting could benefit me, thinking they were helping when really, it made it ten times worse. I was 3/4 of the way through the book, when I thought to myself, has anything plot-wise actually happened? Nope. Just a bunch of damaging self-hatred that triggered my own. I get that a lot of people love the book and that's fine, I totally get it, but for me, it ended up being a damaging and destructive novel that ended up being quite triggering for my depression.Let me know any thoughts you guys have on this book or any of the things I've discussed!Around the Year in 52 Books Challenge Notes:- 20.

Still working out feelings re: sequel, as original was pure perfection, part of identity, Pride & Prejudice-related (so obviously superior to almost all other works of fiction), etc. Am having trouble reckoning feelings for this novel, as trainwreck of a movie is hanging over head in manner of pinata filled with poo or old, stinky cheeses.Shall not dwell on turd of a movie, however, flawed as it is, because love the lovely book! Like Bridget Jones’s Diary, sequel is based on Jane Austen novel, this time Persuasion.

Naturally, Persuasion suffers from clear lack of Darcy, however Wentworth equally swoon-worthy, also Anne Elliot is obvious patron saint of Singletons everywhere, having been declared old spinster at virginal age of 27.Our little Bridget is still struggling with job, money, romance, family (overbearing mother, drunken father), blah dee blah LIFE in usual ridiculous and fun manner. All old friends are back, including urban family (Jude, Shazzer, Tom), Marrieds (Smug and Otherwise), insane boss Richard Finch, delightful mess Daniel Cleaver, and of course Mark Darcy, with whom Bridget is now deeply in love. New characters join Bridget’s world in form of odious Rebecca, a jellyfish (aka frenemy) on the prowl for Bridget’s boyfriend, and friend Magda’s adorable moppets, created to make Bridget look alternately crazy and competent.Do wish that book had not included any romantic turmoil for Bridget and Mark Darcy, however realize that there would have been conspicuous lack of plot otherwise.

Especially worth reading for special treat in sequel (as all sequels must one-up original) in form of Colin Firth (aka THE Mr. Darcy) being interviewed by Bridget Jones, which unfolds exactly as one would expect.In short, sequel is v.g."

(البته حتما تعداد بسیار زیادی شکست خورده هم وجود داره که طبق معمول دیده نمی شن)شیوه‌های رایج ترک سیگار مثل آدامس و برچسب نیکوتین اعتیاد به دخانیات رو نتیجه 1-عادت 2-اعتیاد جسمانی به نیکوتین می دونند و در این راستا ابتدا تلاش می کنن با ایجاد یک جایگزین برای سیگار عادت به سیگار رو از بین ببرند و بعد با کم کردن دوز نیکوتین اعتیاد فیزیکی رو. ولی واقعیت اینه که اعتیاد به نیکوتین شبیه اعتیاد به روان‌گردان ها می مونه، اعتیاد جسمی خیلی ناچیز و خفیف و اعتیاد روانی بسیار بزرگی داره. متد این کتاب به این صورت هست که اول به اعتیاد روانی (هیولای بزرگ) حمله‌ور می شه و سعی می کنه خیلی منطقی شست و شو‌های مغزی سیگار‌ی‌ها رو از بین ببره و در مرحله بعدی کار اعتیاد جسمی (هیولای کوچک) رو یک‌سره و تمام کنه. نکته مهم اینه که تقریبا اکثر سیگاری‌ها هرچقدرم که از سیگار متنفر باشن باز هم از کنار گذاشتن و نبود اون به ده‌‌ها دلیل منطقی و غیرمنطقی می ترسن، اما چون نویسنده خودش تمام این ترس‌ها رو تجربه کرده و در متن کتاب هم آورده، به این ترس سیگاری ها دامن نمی زنه و به همین دلیل خوندن و به پایان رسوندن کتاب برای کسی که اون رو بدستش گرفت کار سختی نیستپیشنهاد منچیزی تحت عنوان مصرف تفریحی سیگار وجود نداره. ما یا سیگاری نیستیم، یعنی به هیچ عنوان سیگار نمی کشیم یا سیگاری هستیم، یعنی ماهی یک نخ یا هفته‌ای یک نخ یا روزی یکی دو پاکت سیگار می کشیم. اگر با این دسته‌بندی در جرگه سیگاری‌ها قرار می‌گیرد توصیه اکید می کنم که به جای استفاده از شیوه‌ی ""قدرت اراده"" و آدامس و چسب نیکوتین و الکترواسموک، این کتاب رو بخونید. اگر هم تصمیم به ترک ندارید باز هم این کتاب رو بخونید. طرز فکر و نگاه شما رو به سیگار تغییر می ده و حداقل دیگه نه با گول زدن خود، بلکه آگاهانه سیگار می کشید"
399,Underworld,Don DeLillo,3.92,22591,1596,karen,3,"seriously, why does everyone suck this book's dick so much? this book was recommended to me by an ex (who also recommended zuleika dobson and the joke, so he had a good track record until then) who knew how much i liked infinite jest so he thought i would like this one. and if i only liked infinite jest because it was a long book written by a white male, then i suppose i would have liked this book. but i didn't, so it must be something else i'm drawn to in the wallace.i remember i was reading this at the airport where i was going to meet him, like a dutiful girlfriend, and just having my jaw drop at the first part. not because it was soooo goooood like everyone here seems to think. am i really the only one who felt embarrassed by the whole life magazine thing? i remember looking around after i read that part to see if someone was playing a trick on me. when he got off the plane, i just sat there, shaking my head at him sadly. it was the beginning of the end.look - i really liked white noise, but this i just felt to be a bloated, wooden, oddly-phrased book whose language didn't charm me, but made me unhappy. and then he goes and publishes the first bit as a separate book? who does that?? sorry, delillo - its not terrible, so it gets no 2 stars, but i barely cared about anything in this book, and it ruined a relationship. if i die alone, its your fault."
400,Libra,Don DeLillo,3.98,11495,646,Paul Bryant,5,"I'm told that the Don DeLillo who wrote this masterpiece is the same guy who wrote Underworld and White Noise, but as far as I'm concerned that's a plainly ridiculous theory and I'm not buying it at all and I've hired a private investigator to get to the bottom of why there are two Don DeLillos and why this one hasn't sued the other idiot for giving him a bad name. It's a mystery. Libra is entirely great. Its vocals, its backing, the bass, the drums, man alive the drums, the harmonies - celestial, Wilsonian is the only word. And - of course - the lyrics. As we know it's about that JFK thing. The whole thing, all of it. So yes, this is the ur-conspiracy we are dealing with, which all the other conspiracies use as the template. Given my well-advertised detestation of all things conspiracytheoretical, you might think I would want to give Libra the widest of berths. Being a contrarian means I couldn't. I take contrary opinions to myself too. I had to pay my dues. I had to stare the god damned conspiracy in its jowles, I had to rummage in its belly and pick over what it ate last night, ugh, all its grimy details, its filthy postulates and its mind-damaging Agatha-Christie's-Murder-on-the-Orient-Express conclusion that - gasp, look away now - they ALL did it!So I looked and stared and rummaged and poked and turned affadavits over in my hand and ran the tape found in the camera up Marilyn Monroe's backside, all of that. Ech. It's so displeasing. It does not make you a better person. This book is like dancing with Don DeLillo, and dancing with the young President, and dancing with the handsome man who has no face, and cannot be named, while ten quaaludes are slushing through your blood system and dark hands are pouring margaritas for you at each slow waltzlike revolution of the enormous ballroom from whose windows the glitterball reveals gun barrels glinting. Through all the slow-as-the-Devonian-Age build up to even the first faint gleamings of the plot to kill John Kennedy your brain gets reformed, your aesthetic sense gets taken down and reworked with minor chords replacing all the major ones, its like a dream but a weird lovely one, one of those thousand year long dreams you wake from on some Sundays when the world can take long minutes to suck back into place... how long have I been away? Whose face is on my own head now? It takes so long to read Libra, it's such a slog through all this stuff which might have gone down like that or might on the other hand, or not, or partly.What DD does in his gradually accelerating sarabande is to take the absolute standard CIA/Mafia/Teamsters/FBI/Cubans conspiracy and weave all the ghosts and spirits together, voices humming like a hive, all the five hundred characters, into a symphony of incidence and co-incidence wittingly but at the same time blindly moving like a giant shoal of fate towards the moving target in the limousine in Dallas on the day that Deep Purple by Nino Tempo and April Stevens was number one on the Billboard charts.This is a fantastic novel. The imposter ""Don DeLillo"" could never have written it."
6615,Lipstick Jungle: A Novel,Candace Bushnell,3.39,37470,946,Lora,1,"Since the television series was about to come out, I thought I would read this book. I just saved myself and my tivo a lot of hours if the series is anything like the book.*spoiler alert*Generally speaking, the three main characters have no depth, no true conflict, and no real resolving storyline. Nico, the magazine Editor-in-Chief, fights her way to the top, has an affair with a younger man, and ends it but never tells her husband.Wendy, a movie company president, married a weak man & had three kids, then throws money at him to solve all their at-home problems until he finally divorces her. Victory, a famous fashion designer, falls in love with a billionaire and decides she too would like to have that kind of money by working hard at fashion. YAWN!I see this book as a ridiculous attempt to capture the experience of Sex In The City without any real drama."
2420,Floodgates of the Wonderworld: A Moby-Dick Pictorial : Celebrating the 150th Anniversary of the Publication of Melville's Masterwork,Robert Del Tredici,4.6,5,1,Etola,4,"This book features dozens of illustrations done by Robert Del Tredici for the book Moby Dick. It is a must for anyone who loves or even likes Moby Dick; and for the student stuck reading it for a class, perhaps these illustrations can provide a fresh perspective on what can be a challenging, seemingly unapproachable text.While the two short essays in this book provide some interesting viewpoints on the art, the real joy of this book is the beautiful pen-and-ink and screenprint illustrations that are featured. Rather than focusing on the external narrative of Moby Dick, Del Tredici chose to illustrate the book's more philosophical moments and, in fact, incorporated the text into his art. At times comical, at times startling, his art has an impressive vitality to it that suits his subject matter well."
2413,Moby Dick,Herman Melville,3.47,401984,11411,Jason,5,"“Where the White Whale, yo?”Ah, my first DBR. And possibly my last, as this could be a complete shit show. Approaching a review of Moby-Dick in a state of sobriety just wasn’t cutting it, though. So let’s raise our glasses to Option B, yeah?I fucking love this book. It took me eight hundred years to read it, but it was so, so worth it. Melville’s writing is impeccable. The parallels he draws, even when he’s seemingly pulling them out of his ass, which I swear to God he’s doing, because who can find this many parallels to draw when talking about a whale, are just perfect. He can compare any and every aspect of the whale—did you know this whole book is about a whale?—to the human condition. And he does so in a way that is humorous and poetic. It is pretty remarkable, I tell you.So here’s the thing: I had zero interest in whales before starting this book. But holy hell if I haven’t been googling the crap out of them lately. I mean, it’s the mark of a superior writer (isn’t it?) to command one’s attention—not just to hold it but to carry it forth hither and thither—for seven hundred pages of a book about a whale. It’s impressive, really, when you think about it. And yet, this book suffers a severe level of under-appreciation on TEH GOODREADS. It has an average rating of 3.33, which is extraordinarily dismal by this website’s standards (and with almost a quarter million ratings so far, it is unlikely to migrate much from that figure). So in an attempt to understand what it is people hate about this book, I filtered the community reviews to show 1-star results, and here is what I’ve discovered:• This book would have been great, admits Anulka, if it weren’t for that darn tootin’ whale interfering with the story.• The language is too much for Gil Michelini, who believes words have their place (after all we are not heathens!), but they simply do not belong in this novel.• Marlan’s complaint is that there is too great a lack of story here, so much so that it feels crammed in. It’s like trying to squeeze a cookie into a breadbox.• Some have experienced extreme aversions to this book. It has made Colleen seasick, quite frankly; it has totally messed up Edwin’s mind; and it has made Robert want to light himself on fire. Even Liz has acknowledged a preference for drowning if such an option existed as a substitute for reading Moby-Dick.• Tracy Dunning would recommend renting the cartoon version, which far surpasses the actual text in storytelling capability.• Still others have been befuddled by this novel’s ability to hoodwink its readers into thinking they like it (when in fact they don’t), a bizarre phenomenon Esther Hansen can personally attest to.• Finally, Keya offers a sobering perspective, which is that people are only reading this book to read it, meaning that if they weren’t reading it, then it would simply be a book not being read. Truly, Yogi Berra couldn’t have put it better himself.But Keya does bring up an interesting point here: why doesn’t Ahab just “get over it” and live his life? I mean, should that be so hard? In some sense, the White Whale is nothing more than a stand-in for everything that has gone wrong in Ahab’s life. He mounts this campaign against the stand-in but isn’t that sort of disingenuous? After all, it’s not the whale that’s responsible for his miserable life. Ahab claims to be an instrument of fate, but fate in this case seems nothing more than a self-fulfilling prophecy.Oh, fuck, my fingers hurt from the backspace.Look, here’s the bottom line. I was afraid this book would be long and boring. And now I wonder how many people hesitate reading it because of its bad rap. Well I’m here to tell you, Potential Reader, this book might be long but it is by no means boring. (Therefore, it is long and exciting? TWSS?) I implore you to ignore the negative reviews! Melville has a talent for flowing, humorous prose, and there is so much of it here to enjoy.So go find your White Whale.(P.S. Gin rules.)"
4809,Longitude,Dava Sobel,3.95,42783,1949,Pramod Nair,4,"Longitude from Dava Sobel is a fascinating account of how a virtually unknown watchmaker named John Harrison conquered one of the oldest and thorniest problems surrounding the ocean voyages - the problem of accurately measuring longitude -, which stumped even the best of scientific minds for centuries. A fascinating problemIt was Ptolemy in ‘Geographia’, written in the 2nd century, who contributed the concept of a co-ordinate system based on the imaginary lines of latitude and longitude, for accurately plotting any spot on the surface of earth. With these imaginary lines he bought a new light in to the maritime explorations and map-making methods of his time. The sailors while at the ocean found it pretty straightforward to find their current latitude - which is drawn parallel to each other while girdling the globe – by measuring the height of the sun or any known celestial bodies. But accurately measuring their current longitude was an entirely different case, as the longitudinal lines loop from the North Pole to the South Pole and back again in great circles, which converge at the ends of the earth. Since it is an angular measurement, which is based on time, the sailors had to have access to two different times - the current time on-board the vessel and the time at a known and pre-selected longitudinal location – at the same instance for calculating the hour differences to work out the geographical separation and the longitude. From a modern viewpoint with our easy-to-carry accurate time-telling devices and instant communication this problem, which a sailor faced in finding the exact time at two different locations, may feel far-fetched. But a sailor in the middle of an ocean pre-dating 18th century only had limited resources in the form of either a pendulum driven clock which was not at all reliable – as the factors like gravity, motion of the vessel, temperature and atmospheric pressure affected the pendulum and there by the time – or by comparing positions of moon or planets like Mars with their anticipatory positions in working out the longitudinal values; both these methods were crude with a high level of inaccuracy.Since the days of Ptolemy, legendary scientific and exploratory minds like Amarigo Vespucci, Sir Issac Newton and Galileo Galilei did a lot of research into this matter but it took sixteen more centuries for mankind to finally invent a reliable solution for this problem.A tragedy & the declaration of a prize moneyIn 1707, a British fleet of vessels under Admiral Sir Clowdesley Shovell met with a tragic disaster as the result of miscalculations in their whereabouts leading to the sinking of four warships with a death toll of more than 1600 mariners. This disaster and huge protest from the merchants and seamen resulted in the formation of a parliamentary committee for finding a practical solution for the longitude problem. This was followed by the 1714 ‘Longitude Act’ by the parliament, which promised a prize money of £ 20,000 for a suitable solution. Dava Sobel covers this formation of the committee and the announcement of the reward in detail.Sir Issac Newton, who was consulted by the committee, at first suggested the idea of a ‘watch’ for tackling the longitude problem.“One method is by a Watch to keep time exactly. But, by reason of the motion of the Ship, the Variation of Heat and Cold, Wet and Dry, and the Difference of Gravity in different Latitudes, such a watch hath not yet been made.”But he believed that such a watch with too many technical challenges was not going to be a reality and was aligned more towards finding a solution for the longitude problem in the realms of astronomy. “A good watch may serve to keep a reckoning at Sea for some days and to know the time of a celestial Observation; and for this end a good Jewel watch may suffice till a better sort of Watch can be found out. But when the Longitude at sea is once lost, it cannot be found again by any watch.”Newton died in 1727, and therefore did not live to see the predecessor of the modern day chronometers become a reality. At the same time another less known figure; a skilled watchmaker from Lincolnshire named John Harrison who was stimulated by the scientific and the monetary factors surrounding this riddle decided to find a solution of his own. Possessed with a brilliant mind he succeeded initially in creating a prototype and then further versions of perfect working models of the world’s first marine-chronometers thereby revolutionizing the ocean travels. His handmade sea-clocks - which are elaborate pieces of engineering marvels and still in display in working condition at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, England - gave the world the first reliable method for measuring the longitude.Dava Sobel records the background and each step of this pioneering invention in an easy to read form, by guiding the reader through a tumultuous story of the sheer determination and relentless pursuit for perfection from a self made man and the obstructions, unkempt promises and villainy he had to face from some of his jealous contemporaries. This concise and engaging chronicle of an innovative engineering deed covers a lot of details on the history, science and politics, which led to this invention and is a recommended read for anyone who is interested in maritime history and science. Since I read an updated fully illustrated edition of ‘Longitude’, which was published later, the book was a treasure trove with a large selection of rare photographs - including Harrison's sea-clocks, documents of declarations, letters, scientific articles, maps and diagrams which added greatly to the value of the volume. The illustrated edition is highly recommended."
2418,In the Heart of the Sea: The Epic True Story That Inspired Moby-Dick,Nathaniel Philbrick,4.16,62216,4673,Jeffrey Keeten,5,"”I turned around and saw him about one hundred rods [500 m or 550 yards] directly ahead of us, coming down with twice his ordinary speed of around 24 knots (44 km/h), and it appeared with tenfold fury and vengeance in his aspect. The surf flew in all directions about him with the continual violent thrashing of his tail. His head about half out of the water, and in that way he came upon us, and again struck the ship."" —Owen Chase, first mate of the whaleship Essex. “There she blows!” was as much a part of my vocabulary as a child as “Launch the torpedoes” or “Geronimo” or “Remember the Alamo.” I wasn’t using it correctly, as I was not hunting whales in the middle of Kansas, but I did use it as a rallying cry for a charge against my childhood chums as we chased each other from one end of the farm to the other. Of course, in 1820 when a sharp eyed lad in the crow’s nest spotted a spume on the horizon, he would yell down to his crew mates, “There she blows!” and the chase would be on. The Nantucket ship Essex was commanded by a newly commissioned captain by the name of George Pollard. The ship, an old vessel, had always been thought of as a lucky ship, given that it had returned so many profits to the owners. Much of the crew was green and were on their first whaling voyage. The ranks of Nantucket sailors had been filled out with some African Americans and some men referred to as offshore men, meaning that they were not of Quaker Nantucket stock. Early in the voyage, they hit a squall that nearly heels them over. “For the green hands, the sound alone was terrifying: the shrieking of the wind across the rigging and then a frenzied flapping of sails and creaking of the stays and mast.” Can you imagine that sound? I’d be convinced that I was about to perish, especially when the ship begins to list. Captain Pollard does not spring into action as quickly as he should, but does finally give the right orders, and the good ship Essex rights herself. It was a foretaste of what was going to be a disastrous journey. In the 19th century, over 200,000 sperm whales were harvested for their spermaceti. (770,000 in the twentieth century. We always improve at killing things.) A normal sized whale will have about 500 gallons of this semi-waxy substance in their heads. When exposed to air, it turns to a semi-liquid and looks...you guessed it...like sperm. This oily substance was used to lubricate machinery during the industrial revolution and to light lamps. Eventually, this oil was replaced by lard and then by petroleum, which probably saved the sperm whale population from extinction. Yea, petroleum industry! The whalers also harvested the ambergris from the digestive tract of the whale, which was used as a fixative in perfume. Women didn’t know it, but when they sprayed those beautiful scents on their necks and wrists, they were also spraying whale digestive juice on their carefully coiffed skins.    A sperm whale, what a beauty!In this era, they did not have harpoons that are shot out of a cannon; they had to row right up next to the whale, and someone with the right skill and strength thrust the harpoon into the side of the whale. These are large mammals, the largest toothed whale, reaching upwards of 80 feet long (now only about 65 feet which has been attributed to the excessive hunting of the largest males who, therefore, did not have a chance to pass on their genes.) and weighing 45 tons. They also have the largest known brain of any extinct or modern animal weighing in at 17 lbs. If they can avoid the harpoons of man and keep out of the reach of Orcas, they can live up to 70 years. Once the harpoon was in the whale, the sailors became the fastest moving humans on the planet as the whale would try to escape by fleeing at upwards of 27 mph while pulling the boat and crew along with it. It is about finding that sweet spot in the harpoon so it is balanced perfectly in your hand. You can smell the whale. You can hear the grunts, groans, and farts of the rowers as they try to keep you level with the creature. Your face is slick with whale spume and sweat. You know you might only have one chance at this. You let go the thunderbolt in your hand and hope you will hear the meaty impact of a man killing a god. It wasn’t unusual for green hands to upchuck over the side as they watched the death of a whale. Nathaniel Philbrick gives a description below that left tears stinging my eyes. There is something so majestic about a whale that even the most primitive thinkers among us must feel on some level that killing a whale is an affront against a higher power. When you kill something larger than yourself, something that displays such intelligence, you have to feel the world has been diminished. ”When the lance finally found its marks, the whale would begin to choke on its own blood, its spout transformed into a fifteen-to twenty-foot geyser of gore that prompted the mate to shout. ‘Chimney’s afire!’ As the blood rained down on them, the men took up the oars and backed furiously away, then paused to watch as the whale went into what was known as its flurry. Beating the water with its tail, snapping at the air with its jaws--even as it regurgitated large chunks of fish and squid--the creature began to swim in an ever tightening circle. Then, just as abruptly as the attack had begun with the first thrust of the harpoon it ended. The whale fell motionless and silent, black corpse floating fin-up in a slick of its own blood and vomit.”
  As I was looking through Rockwell Kent’s art for Moby Dick, I was surprised how well I remembered each of the sketches even though I haven’t read the book for decades.So they take the oil, some blubber, and the ambergris; those parts had ready value that made Nantucket in the heyday of the whaling era very wealthy. ”The rest of it---the tons of meat, bone, and guts---were simply thrown away, creating festering rafts of offal that attracted birds, fish, and, of course, sharks. Just as the skinned corpses of buffaloes would soon dot the prairies of the American West, so did the headless gray remains of sperm whales litter the Pacific Ocean in the nineteenth century.” As I was reading this, even before Philbrick brought forth the comparison to the eradication of the buffalo in the same century, I was having flashbacks to Butcher’s Crossing by John Williams. I had to stop and go read something else for the rest of the day. I needed a break to absorb what I had read and also to create some distance between myself and the horrifying images of whales dying that Philbrick so vividly shared with me. As I did with the buffalos in Butcher’s Crossing, I also found myself rooting for the whales.Something triggered in one whale, a monster 85 foot creature, who instead of fleeing from these puny humans turned around and crashed into them. ”Instead of acting as a whale was supposed to---as a creature ‘never before suspected of premeditated violence, and proverbial for its inoffensiveness’---this big bull had been possessed by what Chase finally took to be a very human concern for the other whales.”
  Thomas Nickerson, the cabin boy and youngest member of the crew, drew this sketch of the attack.This St. George of the deep, more dragon than man, with two mighty thrusts with his head turned the Essex into a splintered, sinking wreck. This story of the Essex is what so famously inspired Herman Melville to write his masterpiece Moby Dick. A commercial failure when released, over time has proved to be a canon of American literature. The story of the Essex has continued to be taught in American History classes, inspiring children with the tale of survival. Moby Dick may not appear on many high school syllabuses anymore. The daunting 600+ page count is simply too much for the curricula of the school system, but I did see it appear on a college syllabi not too long ago; unfortunately only excerpts were being studied. The survival of eight crew members out of a total of twenty is harrowing indeed. A new captain used to taking orders instead of giving orders listened to some bad advice from his first and second mates. 95 days in a boat could have been shortened to mere weeks if he had stuck to his original thinking. There are some interesting discussions about the demise of all the black sailors and of most of the offshore men. In fact, the only three offshore men who survived are the ones who opted to stay on an island rather than continue in the boats. The Nantucket men stuck together, and all five who stayed in the boats who survived were Nantucket men. Philbrick will describe the effects on the body, experiencing extreme thirst and the metabolic rates. Women and older people with lower metabolism actually do better in cold water or in cases of extreme hunger. As gallant as vigorous men like to be, giving extra rations to women and older people, they actually, logically, should be keeping those rations for themselves. Men with high muscle content, who naturally need more calories, will suffer the quickest loss of mass and will die first. Captain Pollard is older and slightly rotund, which gives him an advantage over the younger, leaner sailors. As food and water disappear, they must resort to the most desperate of measures. ”The men were not much more than skeletons themselves, and the story that would be passed from ship to ship in the months ahead was that they were ‘found sucking the bones of their dead mess mates, which they were loath to part with.’”

3738,"Typee, Omoo, Mardi",Herman Melville,3.62,645,21,Zepp,5,"Reading Mardi, very excited about it so far. Typee was pastoral and exotic, but run through with tension fear and violence. Some great pithy passages about savagery vs. civilization. Stranger and sadder than I expected, with disturbing suggestions underneath a simple story.Omoo, continuing the story, displays a 'civilized' island world, in ferocious contrast to that described in Typee. Some incredibly funny moments, as the colonizers and missionaries (mainly absent in Typee) are exposed to Melville's incindiary barbed gaze.Typee and Omoo- four stars each. Edition- 5 stars."
2416,Moby Dick,Herman Melville,3.47,401984,11411,Jason,5,"“Where the White Whale, yo?”Ah, my first DBR. And possibly my last, as this could be a complete shit show. Approaching a review of Moby-Dick in a state of sobriety just wasn’t cutting it, though. So let’s raise our glasses to Option B, yeah?I fucking love this book. It took me eight hundred years to read it, but it was so, so worth it. Melville’s writing is impeccable. The parallels he draws, even when he’s seemingly pulling them out of his ass, which I swear to God he’s doing, because who can find this many parallels to draw when talking about a whale, are just perfect. He can compare any and every aspect of the whale—did you know this whole book is about a whale?—to the human condition. And he does so in a way that is humorous and poetic. It is pretty remarkable, I tell you.So here’s the thing: I had zero interest in whales before starting this book. But holy hell if I haven’t been googling the crap out of them lately. I mean, it’s the mark of a superior writer (isn’t it?) to command one’s attention—not just to hold it but to carry it forth hither and thither—for seven hundred pages of a book about a whale. It’s impressive, really, when you think about it. And yet, this book suffers a severe level of under-appreciation on TEH GOODREADS. It has an average rating of 3.33, which is extraordinarily dismal by this website’s standards (and with almost a quarter million ratings so far, it is unlikely to migrate much from that figure). So in an attempt to understand what it is people hate about this book, I filtered the community reviews to show 1-star results, and here is what I’ve discovered:• This book would have been great, admits Anulka, if it weren’t for that darn tootin’ whale interfering with the story.• The language is too much for Gil Michelini, who believes words have their place (after all we are not heathens!), but they simply do not belong in this novel.• Marlan’s complaint is that there is too great a lack of story here, so much so that it feels crammed in. It’s like trying to squeeze a cookie into a breadbox.• Some have experienced extreme aversions to this book. It has made Colleen seasick, quite frankly; it has totally messed up Edwin’s mind; and it has made Robert want to light himself on fire. Even Liz has acknowledged a preference for drowning if such an option existed as a substitute for reading Moby-Dick.• Tracy Dunning would recommend renting the cartoon version, which far surpasses the actual text in storytelling capability.• Still others have been befuddled by this novel’s ability to hoodwink its readers into thinking they like it (when in fact they don’t), a bizarre phenomenon Esther Hansen can personally attest to.• Finally, Keya offers a sobering perspective, which is that people are only reading this book to read it, meaning that if they weren’t reading it, then it would simply be a book not being read. Truly, Yogi Berra couldn’t have put it better himself.But Keya does bring up an interesting point here: why doesn’t Ahab just “get over it” and live his life? I mean, should that be so hard? In some sense, the White Whale is nothing more than a stand-in for everything that has gone wrong in Ahab’s life. He mounts this campaign against the stand-in but isn’t that sort of disingenuous? After all, it’s not the whale that’s responsible for his miserable life. Ahab claims to be an instrument of fate, but fate in this case seems nothing more than a self-fulfilling prophecy.Oh, fuck, my fingers hurt from the backspace.Look, here’s the bottom line. I was afraid this book would be long and boring. And now I wonder how many people hesitate reading it because of its bad rap. Well I’m here to tell you, Potential Reader, this book might be long but it is by no means boring. (Therefore, it is long and exciting? TWSS?) I implore you to ignore the negative reviews!

7030,The Truth about Beauty: Transform Your Looks and Your Life from the Inside Out,Kat James,4.04,317,45,Fran,1,"I'm changing my review about this book. I have a Master's degree in nutrition and feel compelled to correct it. The book itself is misleading; I read it and thought that it was fairly balanced, recommending avoidance of processed carbohydrate foods and refined flours. Good: don't eat sugar, don't eat flour, eat an abundance of good fat; I'm good with that. But then a relative of mine actually went to one of James' Total Transformation workshops. It turns out the program Kat James actually preaches in her workshops is CRAZYTOWN. It's a ketogenic diet. No carbs at all. Not good carbs, not any carbs. Basically it's a free-for-all on heavy cream. Which, in my professional opinion is dangerous long-term. Not to mention unsustainable and unnatural. Not to mention, it won't work for everyone in terms of losing weight (Not everyone has the genetic makeup of an Inuit). Plus, the diet relies far too heavily, in my opinion, on made-up copies of desserts and treats sweetened with xylitol and stevia. While I do agree that xylitol and stevia are healthier sweeteners, I don't think they should be used in the amounts James actually recommends to her clients, as they only propagate a dependency on sweet tastes regardless of whether they are carbohydrate-containing.I don't know where the disconnect happened between the recommendations in the book and the recommendations James actually preaches happened. But don't bother reading this book if you want sane, scientific, proven health and weight-loss advice. Instead read anything Dr. Mark Hyman has ever written. He knows what he's talking about and has helped thousands of people transform their health. If you suffer from obesity or diabetes, read Hyman's The Blood Sugar Solution. If you want to lose a few and get healthier, read UltraMetabolism."
7047,The Tale of Genji,Murasaki Shikibu,3.71,8008,685,Michael Finocchiaro,5,"The Tale of Genji is one of the hallmarks of classic Japanese literature - the equivalent to, say, the Canterbury Tales or the Divine Comedy or Dox Quixote - from which thousands of pieces of art, pottery and writings have been inspired. It is a sweeping bildungsroman about a Japanese prince in the 10th/11th century Heian court in Kyoto. Well, ex-prince because the emperor had to strip him of his title for political reasons. The tale has over 400 characters and is a true masterpiece of style and description. In the translation I read, each chapter has a beautiful haiku before the narrative and the translation just drips off the page with limpid, gorgeous text. I read this during my honeymoon and despite its occasional melancholic tone, it was one of the most challenging and yet beautiful things I ever read. I can only imagine what beauty must be in store for those lucky enough to be able to read it in the original Japanese.One of the greatest books ever written. A good respite from the fake news and twitter bullshit that is clogging the airwaves..."
7052,"Blue Shoes and Happiness (No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, #7)",Alexander McCall Smith,4.05,22045,997,Shiloh,4,"This is the sixth book in the ""No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency"" series that I have read. This book was so much fun for me, not just because it is a easy read and a fun story, but it has so many memories. I love that I know what the hot Botwana sun feels like , or what Kigale hill looks like, or that I can pronounce the Setswana words. I can relate to Mma Ramotswe (which was also the name of our nanny) on what a unique country Botswana is politically in Africa and the pride in their first president Siretse Khama. I imagine Mma Ramotswe as Mma Jane our cultural teacher. She was a ""traditionally built"" lady with a sense or humor and a lot of wisdom. As much as this brought brought warm fuzzies and pride in me, it was actually my least favorite in the series so far, but still a fun read."
2317,"And All Between (Green Sky, #2)",Zilpha Keatley Snyder,4,511,30,Mary-Beth,4,"When I read these, I think I read this book first. I feel it's the best of the series.The Erdlings live below the ground beneath The Root. When the council decides that Teera's pet lapan is to be used for food (living conditions below the root are difficult and food is scarce) Teera runs away and enters the world above the Root.Astonished by the abundance of greenery and food in this new world, Teera wanders until she is discovered by Raamo and Neric, Ol-zaan priests from the Green-Sky, a community which exists in the trees.It's a very interesting series for young adults which deals with the concept of otherness. The beings who inhabit the trees have beliefs that those who live below the root are evil and they call them ""Greets-kel."" Those living below the ground have a superstitious fear of anything above the Root. I loved this series as a child and when I re-read them they were slightly less wonderful, a little too preachy, but still very good."

6339,Never Let Me Go,Kazuo Ishiguro,3.8,328533,22300,Trevor,5,"It is a pity that people are told this is a science fiction book before they read it. I feel the least interesting thing about it is that it is science fiction. I mean this in much the same way that the least interesting thing one could say about 1984 is that it is science fiction. As a piece of literature I enjoyed it much more than Margaret Atwood's Oryx and Crake and even more than Huxley's Brave New World. The themes that make this book most interesting are to do with the social alienation of groups of people on the basis of inherited genetic characteristics. In fact, as a critique of racism this book is utterly brilliant. Those being racially alienated are genetically identical (they are in fact clones) to those attacking them.Plato believed those 'in the know' should tell lies to those 'who do not know' so as to protect them from the all too horrible truths about life. I have always hated this aspect of Plato, always finding it grotesque and frightening in its implications. Those implications are drawn out in all their disturbing horror here. This book has much to say about the nature of 'illness' and how those inflicted with an 'illness' use the scars of that illness as the badges of truly belonging to the group. So that those 'less advanced' in the ravages of the illness don't really know or really belong to the group. As a portrait of victims adopting to being victims it says much about us as humans - thoughtful readers may find it says far too much. I write this on World Aids Day.Ishiguro writes the most nightmarish novels I've ever read. In others, such as The Unconsoled or  When We Were Orphans the nightmare feeling is due to the dreamlike oddity of the interconnection of events in the story. One reads these books in much the same way that one wakes from a disturbing dream, with feelings of disorientation and anxiety. Even though this is the most literal 'nightmare book' of his I have read - the world he creates being literally a nightmare, and made all the worse by being set in the recent past - it is a book totally lacking in that strange dreamlike quality so characteristic of these other novels. In this sense it seemed less of a nightmare than these others. If you struggled with these, you will not struggle with this in quite the same way.He also has fascinating and quite painful things to say about the nature of love and how love has a proper time, a time that may be lost or missed. As someone who has loved, lost and missed I found this particularly challenging. The relationship between sex and love and illness is perhaps something people may find simply too much - not because this is handled in any way that is too explicit, but because I do believe we like to think that sex, as a manifestation of love, has curative and redemptive powers. A book that questions this, questions something we hold very dear and some readers may find this too much to ask.This is also a book about betrayal. The betrayals we commit against those we love the most and yet that we barely can understand or explain after we have committed them - these are constant throughout the book. He is a writer all too aware of the human condition. The scene which gives the book its title is a wonderful example of the near impossibility of our being understood by others and yet our endless desire for just such an understanding.There is nothing easy about reading this book - although it is written in the simplest of prose. It has an honesty of feeling that brands one's soul.I loved this book and have thought about it a lot since I finished reading it and will think about it more. There is much more I would like to say, but there is no space. May we all be good carers before we complete."
6340,Homeric Moments: Clues to Delight in Reading the Odyssey and the Iliad,Eva Brann,4.33,112,11,Brian,5,"If you read one book on the Odyssey and/or the Iliad make it this one.I had Ms. Brann as a tutor at St. John's College in 2008. I was lucky to get exposed to her style and SJC at that time and it gives a great depth to her work.However, anyone who has read and enjoyed Homer will be amazed at the approachability and depth of Homeric Moments.I especially enjoyed the explanation of the greek language and structure of the epic poem. Also, Ms. Brann's ability to relate Homer to Shakespeare, Tolstoy, Austen, and the great English Romantics brought both a clarity in meaning to her explanations and a direction for further study.Amazingly in depth, but so elegantly explained. Take for instance one sentence comparing Achilles and Odysseus:""As Achilles is taken over by 'menis', Odysseus is the man of 'metis', of measured calculated planning.""I cannot recommend this book enough."

2199,Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln,Doris Kearns Goodwin,4.29,110057,5972,Dana Stabenow,5,"I heard Goodwin talk about this book on NPR, and she sounded like she'd been an eyewitness to the events. Sold me the book.On June 17th--I've been a hundred pages from the end for ten days. I don't want Abe to die.July 17th -- Okay, I finally made myself finish. Abe's dead and I'm a wreck.In this book Goodwin puts Abraham Lincoln in the context of his peers, many of whom ran against him for the first Republican nomination for president (remember they'd just invented that party) and one of whom, Stanton, had treated him with outright contempt in a law case years before. Seward accepted the job of Secretary of State thinking Lincoln would be his puppet, and Chase literally ran his second campaign for president out of the Department of the Treasury. Lincoln understood them all, tolerated them all, put them all to work for the nation that needed them so badly, and jollied, coaxed, cajoled and reasoned them all to victory. A reporter asked him how he could take all these vipers to his bosom and Lincoln replied that these were the best and most able men available and their country needed them, and that he wouldn't be doing his job if he didn't put them to work for it. There can't be anyone who has ever occupied the Oval Office more selfless than Abe.This book is wonderfully written, accessible even to the most casual reader, full of humor and choler and kindness and vitriol, and wisdom. Goodwin has that ability known only to the best historians (David McCullough does, too) to pluck the exact quote necessary from the record to illuminate the scene she is describing, and make the transition from past to present seamless. Listen to Goodwin on Lincoln in his 1862 state of the union address (pp. 406-7):...he closed his message with a graceful and irrefutable argument against the continuation of slavery in a democratic society, the very essence of which opened ""the way to all,"" granted ""hope to all,"" and advanced the ""condition of all."" In this ""just, and generous, and prosperous system,"" he reasoned, ""labor is prior to, and independent of, capital."" Then, reflecting upon the vicissitudes of his own experience, Lincoln added: ""The prudent, penniless beginner in the world, labors for wages awhile, saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land for himself; then labors on his own account another while, and at length hires another new beginner to help him."" Clearly this upward mobility, the possibility of self-realization so central to the idea of America, was closed to the slave unless and until he became a free man.The American Dream, articulated, in words guaranteed to be understood by everyone. You close this book knowing not just about these people, you actually feel like you know them, especially Abe.Impossible, after reading this book, not to wonder what our nation would look like had Lincoln survived his second term. Impossible not to grieve his loss."
2203,John Adams,David McCullough,4.05,224792,5396,Stephen,5,"MESSAGE TO BIOGRAPHERS: Tidy up your prose, sharpen your story-telling, knowledge up on your source material and bring your entire bag of game, because the gauntlet has been chucked, the bar has been raised and David McCullough has taken off his literary glove and pasted all of you upside your second rate heads. The challenge is before you. This is, WITHOUT QUESTION, the best biography I have ever read. It is also, again WITHOUT QUESTION, the best story on the American Revolution and the creation of the United States of America that I have ever read. The breadth, depth and detail of this biography is unbelievable. Epic does not begin in describe it. It is epic epicness on an epically epic scale. This is only appropriate given the subject matter. After finishing this book, I believe the John Adams is the ""founding father"" I most admire. By making that statement, I do not want to downgrade the importance of the others. Jefferson was arguably more intelligent and was clearly the better writer. Washington was the most beloved and admired figure and without his leadership, the fledgling country would not have had a much needed symbol to rally around and the revolution may very well have failed. Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Paine, James Madison, Samuel Adams, John Jay and all the rest deserve to be acknowledged for their significant contributions. So why John Adams? Two simple but very important reasons. First, John Adams, through the beautiful prose of McCullough, came across to me as the quintessential HONORABLE MAN. True, he was short tempered and intellectually vain in so far as he very much desired to be acknowledged as ""great"" by his countrymen. He was a man with many faults. However, he NEVER allowed any of his shortcomings or personal desires to influence any decision he made or any action he took. He was a ROCK OF INTEGRITY and every action he took and decision he made (though not always correct in hindsight) was what he genuinely BELIEVED to be in the best interest of the country. Thus, he came across in this story as the person who most aptly illustrated the qualities of INTEGRITY, VIRTUE AND MORAL FORTITUDE. In contrast, Jefferson's ""behind the scenes"" attacks on Adams and his inability to even acknowledge the same later on struck me as shallow and less than admirable. I point that out not to bash Jefferson (who I also admire) but to demonstrate that even the best of men had moments when they did not act in accordance with their conscience. Everyone that is, except John Adams, who never seemed to waiver from the path his conscience set before him. The second reason, and one that goes hand in hand with the first, is the absolute devotion, respect and love that he and his wife, Abigail, displayed for one another throughout their lives. Call me sappy and overly sentimental, but I was absolutely awe struck by the level of commitment and affection that they felt and showed to one another even across great distances and during long years when they hardly even saw each other. John and Abigail drew strength and comfort from one another in a way that was special and unique. This just cemented for me the truly exceptional nature of John Adams' character. He made me proud to be an American and to have such men in my country's history. Anyway, to sum up, I loved this book and give it my HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!! 6.0 Stars. One final note: for those of you that listen to audiobooks, I wanted to point out that I listened to the unabridged version (all 30+ hours of it) narrated by Nelson Runger and Mr. Runger did an amazing job that I believe added both to my enjoyment and absorption of the material.

After reading this book, I had to buy the ATLANTIS CARDS that she puts out as well. What an amazing tool to help a person connect with their inner divine nature. Also, the channeler Wendy Kennedy - who channels the 9th Pleidian Collective - highlights and gives more detail into the Atlantis Period in history - if you are interested.Personally, I am eagerly looking forward to the day when a movie director, like Oliver Stone or anybody really, comes out with a real-life movie of Atlantis!!

2745,Real Boys: Rescuing Our Sons from the Myths of Boyhood,William S. Pollack,3.81,1327,118,nicebutnubbly,1,"Crappy. Seriously, this came highly recommended, but I was totally unimpressed. At the same time as he pushes the obvious (don't tell your son to ""act like a man"" when he cries, take his feelings seriously, &etc.) the author is also doing whole chapters on the special (and different!) relationships between mothers and sons and fathers and sons. In other words, there's no attempt to repudiate the gender divide, only to ameliorate its negative effects on boys.

2747,"The Wonder of Boys: What Parents, Mentors and Educators Can Do to Shape Boys into Exceptional Men",Michael Gurian,3.7,939,141,Frrobins,1,"The GoodWhile my review is predominately negative, there were a few redeeming qualities to this book. It calls for fathers to be involved with their children. He also brought up the point that the US is one of the few societies in the world where mom and dad alone are expected to raise their children. Other societies rely heavily on extended family and friends for assistance. He calls for a more communal approach to raising children and has positive things to say about day care as a way of building a village for a child if the parents put the effort in to make the day care workers part of the family. He also calls for the acceptance of boys who are gay.I also liked his idea of using stories as a teaching tool for moral behavior and development.The BadThe science. Gurian maintains that science backs that idea that boys are inherently different from girls. The problem is the research does not support his assumptions. He perpetuates the myth that boys are better at math than girls without realizing that the differences aren't statistically significant. For those who aren't familiar with statistics, when an experiment is run there's a possibility that the results derived from the experiment were due to chance, not correlation. They have a neat formula that they can use to figure out whether or not the results were due to chance. If the number isn't high enough, then the results aren't statistically significant and likely are due to chance. So boys scored 2% higher than girls in math...and it wasn't statistically significant! Meaning it was most likely due to chance! For a more thorough discussion of this, I refer you to Carol Tavris' ""The Mismeasure of Women.""Further, more research has supported the contention that environmental factors are at play with the difference in math skills. Just type in ""boys are better at math myth"" on Google and several research studies will pop up explaining this.Gurian maintains that testosterone also plays a role in making boys intrinsically different. He cites that people in jail high higher testosterone levels. OK, now repeat this with me: Correlation does not equal causation! Once again, Gurian tries to make an open and shut case for the role that testosterone plays in behavior when that data is rather mixed (look up testosterone studies). Do higher testosterone levels drive boys to behave more aggressively, or does behaving aggressively cause testosterone levels to rise?He even mentions environmental factors in his book as while dismissing their potential significance for shaping aggressive behavior. He cites evidence that baby boys are cuddled and breastfed less than baby girls. Are boys aggressive because of excess testosterone, or are they more aggressive because they weren't cuddled and breastfed as much as girls? Gurian seems to think it's solely the former rather than the latter. He even includes a quote from a women wondering if it was okay for her four-year-old son to hit her. I doubt that someone would ask if it's okay for a four-year-old girl to hit. I have seen with my own eyes someone excusing the aggressive behavior of a boy toddler away because he was a boy and becoming more boyish. Girls are discouraged from acting aggressively. Yet Gurian completely discounts this.The third thing he uses to justify innate gender differences is brain structure differences. While there are differences in how mens and womens' brains are shaped and structured, he doesn't provide any proof that these actually result in behavioral or achievement differences. The brain is very malleable. For instance, my husband had a bad seizure when he was 3 that killed half of his brain. The left half of his brain is dead. He only has use of the right half of his brain. Yet he has a Master's degree, holds a job, and no one who knew him would guess that half of his brain is not functioning unless told so. And he's not the only one. Other children have had parts of their brain removed due to seizures or other injuries, and you would not guess it about them unless they told you.Then he uses evolutionary psychology to justify the notion that men are compelled to spread their seed. Evolutionary psychology is on shaky grounds. Behavior leaves no fossil evidence. Back then there were no written records to tell us what life was like. How can we conclusively say anything about how behavior evolved as a result? We can't.Based on this misuse of science, he then makes sweeping generalizations that all boys are aggressive, relish competition, and are slaves to testosterone. This is as insulting to boys and men as it is limiting. And to think that something as complex as a human being is relegated merely to the influences of one hormone and brain structure differences is a dangerous simplification. Boys face complex problems today because we live in a complex world. Yet the crux of his argument is that boys face problems today as a result of the feminist movement trying to turn boys into girls.I really had to wonder if Gurian was at all aware that we currently live in an era mired in the backlash against the feminist movement. He maintains that attacks by feminists against the good old patriarchy is the root of the problem. According to Gurian we live in a world where organized sports are constantly under threat, the Boy Scouts of America has been dismantled, and boys are expected to take sewing lessons or something. Reality check, organized sports are alive and well, as are the Boy Scouts, and boys babies are given clothes with trucks that are blue and girl babies are given clothes with lace that are pink. Go to the toy store where toys are segregated into ""girl's toys"" and ""boy's toys."" Where is this system wide extermination of masculinity? I don't see it anywhere. Honestly, here he becomes truly alarmist and preys into our societies fears and misconceptions about the feminist movement.He blames feminists for the decline of masculinity because we fear it, without realizing that what we object to is not masculinity, but rigid gender roles and the abuse of power that sometimes accompanies patriarchal institutions. He maintains that feminists have labeled men as abusers without realizing that men who abused their power put themselves in the position of abuser. Feminists put a name to their unreasonable actions and asked that they be held accountable for it.According to him, feminism is to blame for problems that boys face today, without examining other societal factors. He cites that boys are no longer expected to be warriors without taking into account things such as the creation of nuclear weapons and a growing consciousness about the detriments of war. He talks about how boys don't have mentors anymore without taking into account sex abuse scandals and the fears people have about putting their children in the care of a pedophile. He at least mentions America's individualistic nature. Other societal factors he neglects to mention that harm boys is the focus on testing and performance in schools and parents attempting to raise baby Einstein's, leaving no room for free play in children's schedules. Unrealistic expectations of masculinity: what about the boys who aren't competitive and interested in sports who get bullied because they aren't masculine enough? He doesn't even address this, though I guess according to him such a boy does not exist. These are just a few of the things I can think of that are harming boys today, yet Gurian puts the blame squarely on the shoulders' of feminists.And mothers. He attacks mothers for turning children against their fathers during divorce. Honestly, I only seen one divorce where both parents acted reasonably and didn't use the children against each other. All too often BOTH parents use the children as weapons against their partner. Yet mothers get all the blame. And in his chapter on what sons need from their mothers, he spends most of it discussing single mothers and how boys need male role models. Well, my husband and I are happily married with no plans to divorce, so what does my son need from me?According to Gurian, a lot of nurture during the early years, and then to let him go and let my husband make him a man. Um, okay. That was so not helpful.Like some feminists have enshrined the Myth of the Matriarchy, he has created and enshrined his own Myth of Masculinity. He maintains that kings used to understand their sacred duty to their people, and their subjects responded favorably. I don't think history is Mr. Gurian's strong suit, or he'd know that a lot of kings abused their power, cheated on their wives (ever heard of the position of royal mistress?), and had to keep tight control on the nobles to prevent them from revolting against them. He sees the past through rose tinted glasses where communities helped to raise boys who never abused power, when history is replete with just the opposite.Which makes his solutions to the problem so unsatisfying. Get boys in organized sports. Okay. What about the athletes who steal, rape, murder their wives? Get boys into the military. Is he aware of the high rates of spousal abuse among men in the military? Once again, I don't object to organized sports or the military, but I don't see it as a fix all solution. Especially because he never addresses how to ensure that boys won't abuse power if they find themselves in a position to wield it.So in essence, Gurian has twisted scientific evidence to simplify a complex problem and offered a simple solution that doesn't even begin to address the complexity needed to fix it. This book was rather unsatisfying. I did not feel as though I got a good picture of the challenges that would face my son and how to help him navigate life. I was very disappointed."

2753,The Language of New Media,Lev Manovich,3.8,731,26,GONZA,3,"In summary, today strategies used by social media companies often look more like tactics in the original formulation by de Certeau while tactics look like strategies. Since the companies that create social media platforms make money from having as many users as possible visit them (they do so by serving ads, by selling data about usage to other companies, by selling add-on services, and so on), they have a direct interest in having users pour as much of their lives into these platforms as possible. Consequently, they give users unlimited storage space for all their media and the ability to customize their online lives (for instance, by controlling what is seen by whom) by expanding the functionality of the platforms themselves.This, however, does not mean strategies and tactics have completely exchanged places. If we look at the actual media content produced by users, here the relationship between strategies and tactics is different. As I already mentioned, for many decades companies have been systematically turning the elements of various subcultures into commercial products. But these subcultures themselves rarely develop completely from scratch; rather, they are the result of the cultural appropriation and/or remix of earlier commercial culture."

4514,The Ruby Way: Solutions and Techniques in Ruby Programming (Addison-Wesley Professional Ruby Series),Hal Fulton,3.91,298,20,Marshall,1,"A mediocre, outdated, verbose book about the Ruby programming language. In 900 pages, this book covers anything any everything Ruby-related, going into (often excrutiating) detail about even the most arcane Ruby libraries. The code samples in this book are pretty bad examples of idiomatic, clean Ruby code. For example, he has a consistent habit of using rescue clauses with no exception names, a terrible practice which commonly leads to false-positives. Even syntax errors will be ignored! The explanations are pretty bad too. This book even confused me about concepts I'd already understood. This book may work as an okay cookbook, but you'd be better off just reading the Ruby Cookbook. It can also be used to discover some libraries you may have never heard of. But by all means, do NOT try to read this all the way through or, God forbid, use it to actually learn Ruby,"

His writing can be confusing to young readers considering his complex references. I ended the book with the realization that a crazy idea formed by a capable and credited person can have the power to demolish the aspects of life as we look at it.  The narrorator of the book, John is in the process of writing a book titled, The Day the World Ended. This book is about the day the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and in order to write it, John needs to do research on Felix Hoenikker who was one of the scientist involved with the atomic bomb. This book really made realize how though science is extremely helpful, credible, and has advanced society in many ways it also has been used to its advantage to cause the worst days in history. The narrator's perspective is what reveals the cruelty that has been done through the knowledge of science. This book would be favored by those who enjoy the different directions that science can go along with authentic humor and strong writing by remarkable Kurt Vonnegut."

1924,Staying Alive in Avalanche Terrain,Bruce Tremper,4.45,207,18,Clayton,5,"You want to make smart decisions in avalanche terrain? This book is an incredibly powerful book to help you to accomplish just that. It was recommended reading for a Level 1 Avalanche course (3-day).The book is densely packed with information and shows you nearly everything you should be aware of when managing your risk in avalanche terrain. There are definitely some sections I skimmed through since it was too science-y or didn't fit my skill level though. As a backcountry newbie, the section on the pros/cons of the different snow tests is fairly valuable. Going back and forth with this book after each tour will help solidify the ideas presented in the book. Re-reading/skimming through this book at the beginning of each season too may also help to make you the right decisions in those early snow conditions.This book may not really make much sense unless you have already taken an avalanche class because of all the terminology/ideas. I would have been lost if I had read this book prior to taking the class."
1089,Daily Inspiration for the Purpose Driven Life: Scriptures and Reflections from the 40 Days of Purpose,Rick Warren,4.39,2151,80,France,5,"I followed Rick Warren's instructions and read one chapter per day to savor all the learnings and messages in this book. A lot of them confirmed the beliefs that I already have on the reason why we are here in this world and why some things do not go according to our plan. ""Whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.""Still, there were a lot more new insights that I learned which deepened my faith in God and His purpose for my life.  Anytime you feel you are not learning anything from a sermon or a Bible teacher, you should check your attitude, especially for pride, because God can speak through even the most boring teacher when you are humble and receptive.This passage struck me because I often felt sad about not seeming to learn anything from a sermon because the priest was too boring. We are blessed to be a blessing. We are saved to serve, not to sit around and wait for heaven. At the end of your life on earth you will stand before God, and he is going to evaluate how well you served others with your life.If you want to keep growing, the best way to learn more is to pass on what you have already learned. The one who blesses others is abundantly blessed; those who help others are helped. Anyone who knows the right thing to do but does not do it is sinning. Knowledge increases responsibility. But passing along the purpose of life is more than obligation; it's one of life's greatest privileges.Some people sometimes mock me for reading and posting about such spiritual things and even relating it with the holy use of money. These are the people whom I need to reach out to. I pray that they, too, will realize that their purpose here is not to serve their own self-interest but to serve God by serving others."

6240,An Imaginary Life,David Malouf,3.88,1488,144,Jasmine,4,"“Have you heard my name? Ovid? Am I still known? Has some line of my writing escaped the banning of my books from all the libraries and their public burning, my expulsion from the Latin tongue? Has some secret admirer kept one of my poems and so preserved it, or committed it to memory? Do my lines still pass secretly somewhere from mouth to mouth? Has some phrase of mine slipped through as a quotation, unnoticed by the authorities, in another man’s poem? Or in a letter? Or in a saying that has become part of common speech and cannot now be eradicated? Have I survived?” (p.12)""Statuia lui Ovidiu"" by Ettore Ferrari(Own work. Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0 ro via Wikimedia Commons)David Malouf’s prose deserves a 5 star rating. The Australian author is a true master when it comes to describe landscapes, scenery, nature, and human emotions. His writing style is beautiful, hypnotic, and at times simply breath-taking.“Winter here is a time of slow-smoldering resentments, of suspicion, of fantasies that grow as the days move deeper into the year’s darkness and the cold drives us closer together and further apart.” (p.96)In his novel ‘An Imaginary Life’ Malouf sets out to share his ideas of what could have happened in Tomis, a place near the Black Sea at the edge of the Roman Empire, where the Roman poet Publius Ovidius Naso (43 BC – 17/18 AD) was exiled in 8 AD by the Roman Emperor Augustus. Very little is known about Ovid’s exile: our knowledge derives from Ovid’s writing such as ‘Epistulae ex Pontus’ and ‘Tristia’ ( The Poems of Exile: Tristia and the Black Sea Letters) and these sources are far from being reliable. In Malouf’s work Ovid himself undergoes a ‘Metamorphoses’ (*) in Tomis when he meets a wild uncivilized boy who grew up among animals. Here Malouf draws from the experience of J.M.G. Itard and his observations of Victor, which led to the publication of Wild Boy of Aveyron. In Malouf’s fictional story, however, the question arises as to whether Ovid is going to educate the child or vice versa…In the story the urbane and sophisticated Ovid, who in real life wrote didactic poetry about “Cosmetics for the Female Face” (Medicamina faciei femineae), is utterly transformed by his encounter with the uncivilized, raw nature. For the reader who knows Ovid’s work this is hard to believe and, as even Malouf admits, “would have surprised the real poet."":“But that is exactly the point” writes Malouf in his afterword: “My purpose was to make this glib fabulist of ‘the changes’ live out in reality what had been, in his previous existence, merely the occasion for dazzling literary display.” (p.156).This sounds very challenging and I think it is – for both the writer and the reader. Even tough Malouf’s use of the English language has been a wonderful experience for me, he eventually looses one star and gets a solid four star rating from me: While reading Ovid’s transformation I could not overcome a growing ‘New Age’ feeling of the 80’s as, for example, in the following passage:“What else should our lives be but a continual series of beginnings, of painful settings out into the unknown, pushing off from the edges of consciousness into the mystery of what we have not yet become, except in dreams that blow in from out there bearing the fragrance of islands we have not yet sighted in our waking hours, as in voyaging sometimes the first blossoming branches of our next landfall to come bumping against the keel, even in the dark, whole days before the real land rises to meet us.” (p.134)This feeling, of course, is my personal, subjective experience. Unfortunately, it prevents me from categorising his work as a “Modern Classic”, even though Malouf’s prose would absolutely deserve it. “An Imaginary Life” has been my first reading experience of David Malouf and I am happy to have found another great contemporary author.

9021,Long Walk To Freedom (Volume 1: 1918-1962),Nelson Mandela,4.37,448,15,Pete daPixie,4,"Nelson Mandela part wrote this in 1974 while incarcerated on Robben Island, he resumed his 'Long Walk' after his release in 1990. Volume One of his remarkable autobiography covers his life from 1918 to 1962, when his fight for freedom was temporarily curtailed with a five year prison sentence.Here is a startling memoir that documents Mandela's early development as well as that of the A.N.C. and their struggle against the South African Nationalist apartheid government that arose in 1948. 'Die kaffer op sy plek' ('the nigger in his place') was their election slogan and their belief that 'Die wit man moet altyd baas wees' (the white man must always remain boss').Once more history gives an example of the freaks with god on their side. The Nationalists being supported by the Dutch Reformed Church that declared Africaners were God's chosen and blacks were a subservient species.Certainly one of the most astounding political documents of any freedom fighter of the twentieth century, I now have to hope my library has a copy of volume two!"

9809,Invisible Cities,Italo Calvino,4.19,40027,2937,Riku Sayuj,5," Invisible Cities; Imagined LivesMarco Polo was a dreamer. He had great ambitions - wanting to be a traveller, a writer and a favored courtier. He wanted to live in the lap of luxury in his lifetime and in the best illustrated pages of history later. But he could only be a dreamer and never much more. Was it good enough? He never travelled anywhere and spent his life dreaming away in his Venice and is remembered to this day as the greatest explorer and travel writer of all time. How did that come about? It is a tale about the triumph of imagination over experience.In Venice, that city of water, a network of canals and a network of streets span and intersect each other. Marco Polo was traveling in a little boat in that Venice and thinking of the Marco Polo he was meant to be when his imagination began to soar. All the travelogues he wanted to write started coming to his mind. A whole book of descriptions, all made of poems that would describe the beauty of this city like those waves reflecting it in varied shapes among their ripples. He watched the people moving along the streets, each eye seeing the same city differently, dependent on the angle of observation, and speaking in a language of symbols and images that is more powerful than words can ever be. The river is the story, the river is the book, arranged in perfect sinusoidal waves of its own and choosing as its reader the greatest of all appreciators, the book catches the splendor of the city and reflects it for your patient eyes in a sort of primitive cubism, leaving it to you to make out all its meaning and all its poetry and to see ultimately yourself in that reflection of all the cities that imagination could possibly build.He started going on long voyages into his own mind, into the reflections of Venice, and into the reflections of those reflections. And then he wrote them down and he spoke of them and he sang of them. Men stopped to listen. They paid to hear him, first with time, then with gold, then with diamonds and great honors.The Venetian was soon summoned to the court of the great Kublai Khan, who was also a dreamer. He envisioned himself to be the greatest of rulers, his kingdom expanding and pouring over the whole vast world until all the world was under him. He knew that information was power and he wanted to know of every single city under him, and of every city that was to be under him. ‘On the day when I know all the cities,’ he thought, 'I shall be able to possess my empire, at last!’ He wanted Marco polo to be his eyes and ears and sent him off, with instructions to visit the most far flung and exotic provinces and to understand the soul of every city and to report back to him.Marco Polo bowed every time and with great aplomb set off for his great voyages. Next week he would be in his beloved Venice, dreaming up the world, a world more real than reality, with all the ingredients needed to construct a city - memories, desires, signs, skies, trade, eyes, sounds, shapes, names and the dead. He spoke of old cities with gods and demons in it, of cities yet to be, with airplanes and atomic bombs coloring their movements, and of cities that should have been, with happiness and sorrow apportioned in balance. What separates the dream’s reality from the dreamer’s reality? He pondered on this mystery with every city. Maybe all successful men dream our lives as it should be while rotting in some sewer and maybe all unhappy men dream their unhappiness in life while rotting in some palace? Maybe we can only continue our chosen destinies and everything else is a dream. It is only invisible cities we can construct. And we can reflect on them only through imagination, and fiction. He knew his cities were real.It took many years for the Great Khan to realize that Marco Polo wasn't describing cities so much as the human mind and experience. He realized that every city, whether imagined by Marco Polo or constructed by planned blueprints or grown from slow accretion are all dreams given shape by human hands, by human ambition, by a desire for a future that can be shaped. In fact, Marco Polo’s cities started to seem to him more real than any he knew to be real. He learned that if men and women began to live their ephemeral dreams, every phantom would become a city in which to begin a story of pursuits, pretenses, misunderstandings, clashes, oppressions, and the carousel of fantasies would stop.Khan now knew how to travel, to really travel. He could now accompany the great explorer in his prophetic journeys. He could describe cities to Marco Polo and he could listen to him, even as he filled in the details. They could sit together in the courtyard and be silent and still travel through the most exotic and most truthful of cities.Then came a day when Marco Polo had to inform the Khan, ‘Sire, now I have told you about all the cities I know.''There is still one of which you never speak.'Marco Polo bowed his head.'Venice,' the Khan said.Marco smiled. 'What else do you believe I have been talking to you about?'The emperor did not turn a hair. 'And yet I have never heard you mention that name.'And Polo said: 'Every time I describe a city I am saying something about Venice.''When I ask you about other cities, I want to hear about them. And about Venice, when I ask you about Venice.' Khan made an attempt at looking angry but he knew his friend could see through faces and all such masks.'To distinguish the other cities' qualities, I must speak of a first city that remains implicit. For me it is Venice. For those who pass it without entering, the city is one thing; it is another for those who are trapped by it and never leave. There is the city where you arrive for the first time; and there is another city which you leave never to return. Each deserves a different name; perhaps I have already spoken of Venice under other names; perhaps I have spoken only of Venice.’'You should then describe for me Venice - as it is, all of it, not omitting anything you remember of it.''Memory's images, once they are fixed in words, are erased,' Polo said. 'Perhaps I am afraid of losing Venice all at once, if I speak of it. Or perhaps, speaking of other cities, I have already lost it, little by little.’Kublai looked at Polo. He understood. To tell a story you have to start from what you know best. You have to put your soul in the story and then build the flesh, the hair, the face and the clothes around it. The more stories you tell, the more of your soul you invest and lay bare to the world. When do you start fearing that you are as invisible as the cities you create? Kublai continued to look sadly at his friend.Kublai asks Marco, 'When you return to the West, will you repeat to your people the same tales you tell me?''I speak and speak,' Marco says, 'but the listener retains only the words he is expecting. It is not the voice that commands the story: it is the ear.'Then Khan knew that the sadness he felt so pressingly as he tried to force the wine down was not for his dear friend but for himself, he now knew that as he was listening to all the stories that Marco Polo was describing to him, he was only hearing stories that he was telling himself. The cities were all real, but they were not reflections of Marco Polo’s soul, they were not reflecting his Venice. They were reflecting Kublai Khan’s own soul, his own empire, ambitions, desires and fears.Disclaimer: Marco Polo Really Did Go To China, MaybeEdit: I got a message from a goodreader asking me why I put up the whole story of the book without a spoiler warning... Please go ahead and read the review without any fear of spoilers, the connection with the plot of the book (if any) is very tenuous - this is an imagined plot/backstory for a book that deliberately lacks one."

Robert Penn WarrenRobert Penn Warren is the only person to win the Pulitzer prize for fiction as well as poetry. He won the prize for fiction in 1946 for this very book. If you are lucky enough to have a great aunt who reads, and bought a lot of books in the 1940s, you might take a gander at her books some time and see if she has a first edition, first printing of this book in her library.   First edition, First printing of the 1946 editionDepending on the condition of the dust jacket a true first will bring anywhere from $2,000 to $7,000. It will be up to you; if you decide to ""liberate"" the book, tucking it under your shirt, and sneaking it out with the paper bag of home made oatmeal cookies she always sends you home with. If you are not a natural felon you might just say ""hey auntie couldn't you tuck this in a safety deposit box and put my name on it"". The last time I was in New Orleans they were shooting the new movie version of All the King's Men. We sat in a little cafe across from where they were setting up a shoot hoping for a glimpse of one of the marquee actors involved in the production. No luck, just film crew people bustling around trying to build a street scene. We were anxious to explore the little bookshops and artist galleries in the French Quarter, so we left before seeing anything truly interesting. I have not seen the 1949 or 2006 film versions. From the reviews I skimmed, both movies seem to struggle to capture the true essence of the book. I'm not surprised, even if they put the book through a small holed strainer, they would still have way more material than what a standard length movie can handle. 
  1949 Movie Poster
  2006 Movie PosterJack Burden, newspaper reporter, finds himself following around an ambitious, well meaning, but naive candidate named Willie Stark. A man hand picked to split the vote in the primary and insure the nomination of the customary corrupt, crony, politician that Louisiana is famous for. Stark is the only person who is unaware that the fix is on. He is stumping and receiving discouraging indifference from his crowds as he tries to tell them the truth. As he finds himself on the ropes more than he is in the ring, he starts to understand that to be successful he will have to give the crowds what they want. He replaces substance with hyperbole, and Burden observes the emergence of a candidate and the corruption of an honest man. Warren based Stark on the dynamic personage of Louisiana governor Huey P. Long. 
  Huey P. LongBurden soon finds himself unemployed, but Stark always liked him and gave him a prominent position on his staff. Stark, though soundly defeated, uses the time between elections to become a polished orator and electable candidate. Burden studied for a history degree in college and believes from his studies that truth will always win out. As he becomes more ensnared in the shady activities of Governor Stark's administration he starts to stumble over his own high ideas of the worthiness of truth. He tries to convince himself that he just does what the boss wants him to do. What the boss does with the information he brings him has nothing to do with him, but the longer he is involved, and the more people he knows who become victims of Stark's ambition the less distance he can claim.""I didn't mean to cause any ruckus. I didn't think--"" And all the while that cold, unloving part of the mind--that maiden aunt, that washroom mirror the drunk stares into, that still small voice, that maggot in the chess of your self-esteem, that commentator on the ether nightmare, that death's-head of lipless rationality at your every feast--all that while that part of the mind was saying: You're making it worse, your lying is just making it worse, can't you shut up, you blabbermouth!""Burden is in love with Anne Stanton, his childhood friend and the daughter of a previous governor. Briefly they are an item and then they drift apart. Burden marries Lois, the woman who has the ""peach bloom of cheeks, the pearly ripe but vigorous bosom, the supple midriff, the brooding, black, velvety-liquid eyes, the bee-stung lips, the luxurious thighs."" Despite these attributes they have different goals and different ambitions and the elephant in the room is the fact that Jack is still in love with Anne. He becomes close friends with Anne again. He can't help but make allusions to the fact that his marriage proposal is still on the table. Even though she is 35 and never been married she continues to dance around the issue. Burden can't ever see her as just a friend.""It was Anne Stanton herself, who stood there in the cool room of the looking glass, above the bar barricade of bright bottles and siphons across some distance of blue carpet, a girl--well, not exactly a girl any more, a young woman about five-feet-four with the trimmest pair of nervous ankles and smallish hips which, however, looked as round as though they had been turned on a lathe, and a waist just the width to make you wonder if you could span it with your hand, and all of this done up in a swatch of gray flannel which pretended to a severe mannish cut but actually did nothing but scream for attention to some very unmannish arrangements within.""Stark still sees himself as one of the good guys despite the number of men he has felt compelled to destroyed. He came to the conclusion that it was better to destroy them than to bribe them. If he bribes them he still has to keep those untrustworthy associates in his organization. If he destroys them they can no longer thwart his ambitious aims. He is on a self-imposed mission to use the corrupt system, but use it for good.""Goodness. Yeah, just plain, simple goodness. Well you can't inherit that from anybody. You got to make it. If you want it. And you got to make it out of badness. Badness. And you know why? Because there isn't anything else to make it out of.""When Burden experiences the ultimate betrayal it hit me like a left hook coming out of the smokey darkness of an Oklahoma bar. I never saw it coming and I had to stagger away from the book for a while. Jack took 8 days and ran away to California. I took thirty minutes to go stand out on my deck and let some fresh air sort my scattered thoughts.There is a whole marvelous section on Cass Mastern, Jack's relative, who provides a colorful history for Jack to research for his PHD. I almost need a separate review to handle the intricate betrayals explored by Warren in that section. I notice that the departure from the main story line bothered other reviewers. I just thought I'd been handed another thick seam of gold to be mined. I like history and I especially like family history, so I didn't mind the story in the story at all. Political cynicism wrapped in lyrical prose makes this one of the more fascinating books I've read in many, many years. It is an honest book, exposing all the worst elements of human behavior. We are so good at fooling ourselves into thinking that when we do wrong for the greater good we are still on the side of the angels. Highly recommended!!If anyone has any political novels that they love, and feel I should read, please send me your recommendations.

6121,Siddhartha,Hermann Hesse,3.99,425493,11781,Kemper,4,"So there’s a damn dirty hippie in India named Siddhartha who is supposed to be seeking spiritual enlightenment, but instead of going to a good Christian church like a normal person, he wanders around the woods for a while with some other damn dirty hippies. After he meets Buddha, he finally gets tired of being broke-ass and homeless, and he goes into town where he makes a pile of money. This is good because everyone knows that engaging in capitalism is the only proper way to go through life. As a bonus, he also meets a beautiful woman. Then, just when he’s having a good ole time; doing business, drinking, gambling and making time with the woman, the dang fool’s hippie ideas pop up again, and he walks away from all of it. Remember that Chris Farley routine on Saturday Night Live where he’d scream that someone would end up living in a van down by the river? Well, this hippie ends up living in a hut down by the river. And that’s even worse, because at least you could play the radio in a van. Finally, Siddartha thinks that the river is god. Or something stupid like that. It just didn’t make any sense. Give me one of them Lee Child novels any day over this hippie dippie crap. That Jack Reacher is a man’s man!Just kidding.Actually, this is an elegant allegory about a guy going through different phases as he pursues a lifelong quest to rid himself of his ego so that he can know true peace and enlightenment. It’s filled with incredible writing, and it’s short and smart enough to hold the attention of even a doofus like me. I’d put this in the category of books that everyone should read at least once."

Since a poor person does not have access to said doctor, he or she has to just suck it up and go to work itchy.I'm glad that this book might bring some much-needed insight to middle-and-upper-class people to whom it had never before occurred that it's actually really shitty to make minimum wage, that people working shitty service jobs have bad attitudes for very good reasons, that a person can work very hard and still be very poor, and that there are myriad external obstacles that keep poor people from pulling themselves up by their proverbial bootstraps.What I am NOT glad about is that this could have been an excellent, enlightening book about the less abstract aspects of our country's economic structure...but it was not. Instead, it was just a nauseatingly narcissistic exploration of the author's personality.

People who are not poor make many of the same decisions that poor people do (like acquiring a drug habit, or having children, or quitting a job). One big difference is that people with enough money can afford to make bad decisions. Another big difference is that your life feels a hell of a lot different when you don't have an easy out. Maybe working as a waitress is kind of fun and interesting and not too stressful if you know you'll only be doing it until you get bored. It's another thing entirely when your only other real, long term option seems to be some other kind of awful service job, and when you know that this is your life, not a break from your ""real"" job and ""real"" life. When you feel tired and desperate and angry and resigned all the time, when every day you perform the emotional and physical labor of serving people who treat you like shit and pay you practically nothing, how are you supposed to gather enough energy and hope to seek out a better life? You probably can't. Instead, you probably are going to buy some beer or weed and enjoy the few moments of your life that you can.

1874,Por Cuatro Duros/nickel And Dimed: Como (No) Apanarselas En Estados Unidos,Barbara Ehrenreich,3.6,157967,5796,Carrie,1,"Dear Barbara Ehrenreich, How do I resent thee? Let me count the ways:1. You are a wealthy, highly educated person who went on a half-assed, anthropological slumming vacation.2. When said vacation was over, you told your coworkers: ""Surprise! I'm not a poor person after all! I'm going back now to my comfortable life!""...and then you were surprised that those coworkers were mostly worried about the fact that they'd have to work the next shift with one less person.3. You also were surprised that the aforementioned coworkers were neither impressed nor appreciative that you turned out to be a wealthy, highly educated person writing a book about how hard it is to be a poor person. 4. You were slightly offended that nobody saw through your waitress costume; you assumed that smart people are visually recognizable, and it didn't seem to occur to you that real poor people might also be smart and educated.5. The experiences you had while pretending to be a poor person may have instilled in you some amount of sympathy for poor people, but you will never really know what it's actually like to be poor. It was certainly nice enough of you to decide that you shouldn't judge a class of people until you'd walked a mile in their shoes...but you only managed to walk about three paces before your feet hurt and you decided you had seen enough. A real poor person does not have a couple grand to ""start"" with, or to stay afloat between jobs, after finding his or her working conditions intolerable and suddenly quitting. Nor does a real poor person, when he or she develops some nasty rash from said intolerable working conditions, have a private doctor who will phone in a prescription for soothing ointment. Since a poor person does not have access to said doctor, he or she has to just suck it up and go to work itchy.I'm glad that this book might bring some much-needed insight to middle-and-upper-class people to whom it had never before occurred that it's actually really shitty to make minimum wage, that people working shitty service jobs have bad attitudes for very good reasons, that a person can work very hard and still be very poor, and that there are myriad external obstacles that keep poor people from pulling themselves up by their proverbial bootstraps.What I am NOT glad about is that this could have been an excellent, enlightening book about the less abstract aspects of our country's economic structure...but it was not. Instead, it was just a nauseatingly narcissistic exploration of the author's personality. What many people seem not to understand is (among other things) that there is not only one kind of poor person (or only one kind of ""working class"" person), that poverty is not just a condition, but a cycle, and that contemporary poverty is not some ahistorical thing that just recently appeared when people started having poor money-management skills and learned how to make crack. Contemporary poverty is a result of Capitalism, but one doesn't have to be a commie liberal to know that.Sure, there are many poor people who are crack addicts. There are also many, many rich people who are coke addicts. I'm sure that if poor people could afford real cocaine, they would buy that instead of crack, but alas, good cocaine is too expensive for poor drug addicts who make bad decisions. People who are not poor make many of the same decisions that poor people do (like acquiring a drug habit, or having children, or quitting a job). One big difference is that people with enough money can afford to make bad decisions. Another big difference is that your life feels a hell of a lot different when you don't have an easy out. Maybe working as a waitress is kind of fun and interesting and not too stressful if you know you'll only be doing it until you get bored. It's another thing entirely when your only other real, long term option seems to be some other kind of awful service job, and when you know that this is your life, not a break from your ""real"" job and ""real"" life. When you feel tired and desperate and angry and resigned all the time, when every day you perform the emotional and physical labor of serving people who treat you like shit and pay you practically nothing, how are you supposed to gather enough energy and hope to seek out a better life? You probably can't. Instead, you probably are going to buy some beer or weed and enjoy the few moments of your life that you can. Maybe that's a ""bad decision""...or maybe it's just a survival strategy."
1867,The Elements of User Experience: User-Centered Design for the Web,Jesse James Garrett,3.98,2739,107,Tamara,5,"This book essentially dissects the process of website creation, clearly defining every element that goes into planning and implementing a website. This would have provided an invaluable visual map during our last website redesign. Rather than a tangled ball of yarn, I can now see all of the wheels and cogs fit together in a logical manner. It seems that, of the five planes of the user experience development process (the surface plane, the skeleton plane, the structure plane, the scope plane and the strategy plane), I am most interested in the skeleton plane (i.e. navigation, interface and information design) and the structure plane (information architecture). I might have to own this book.Favorite Quotes: If your site consists mainly of what we Web types call ""content"" - that is, information - then one of the main goals of your site is to communicate that information as effectively as possible. It's not enough just to put it out there. It has to be presented in a way that helps people absorb it and understand it. Otherwise, the user might not ever find out that you offer the service or product they're looking for. Habit and reflex are the foundation for much of our interaction with the world...If it involves providing users with the ability to do things, it's interface design...If it involves providing users with the ability to go places, it's navigation design...If it involves communicating ideas to the user, it's information design. Making your interface consistent with others that your users are already familiar with is important, but even more important is making your interface consistent with itself. An interface that gives a small number of extreme cases the same weight as the needs of the vast majority of users ends up ill-equipped to make either audience happy. Presenting a style on your web site that's inconsistent with your style in other media doesn't just affect the audience's impression of the site; it affects their impression of your company as a whole. [Effective content] requires effective maintenance. [Information architecture] draws on a number of disciplines that historically have been concerned with the organization, grouping, ordering, and presentation of content: library science, journalism, and technical communication, among others.[Information architecture and interaction design] are about understanding people, the way they work, and the way they think."

9035,Courthouse Research for Family Historians: Your Guide to Genealogical Treasures,Christine  Rose,4.13,53,5,Laini,5,"Without Christine's handy-dandy guide, I might never have conquered my trepidation of researching in courthouses. With no experience, I was nervous about what I might encounter, and what was necessary to obtain the data I needed. I needed a good guide, but knew I'd have to do my research alone.Now that I've read her book, I can't imagine why I was ever nervous! I started small, in little bitty Monroe (Green County) here in Wisconsin, and have now hit Racine, Marathon, Rock (twice) Counties, and Winnebago County down in Illinois, unearthing oodles of the information I needed to finish my book. I also keep the page with the land record filing system method with me when I go so I can remember the letters to look for, in case I forget. This book changed my life!"

But it’s almost as if Erik Larson wrote two really short books—one about the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition and another about the murder spree of Dr. H. H. Holmes—and then shoved them together to create a single story. The result isn’t bad, and I think Larson is successful at maintaining clean seams between the two narratives, but it’s hard to argue these two occurrences are anything but abstractedly related. Yes, Holmes lived in Chicago at the time of the fair and lured a bunch of people to his murder castle (he be snatchin’ yo’ people up!), but the events didn’t weigh heavily on the fair itself or on the atmosphere surrounding it. No alarm bells went off anywhere in Chicago as a result of his, um, unsavory indiscretions.Still, there is a lot of interesting stuff here, information specific to the world’s fair, and it is fun to learn new things. For example, the Chicago Columbian Exposition exudes a long list of firsts: it saw the invention of the world’s first ferris wheel, it led the nation in its first public observance of the Pledge of Allegiance, and it helped to establish alternating current as the industry standard for electricity distribution. Even that awful snake charmer song has its origins in the Chicago World’s Fair. While writing this review, I’ve come to learn that Leonardo DiCaprio, that beautiful man with the screaming cherry tomato head on a toothpick body, is producing the film adaptation, and will also play the role of serial killer H. H. Holmes. For this I am pleased."

For centuries the greatest minds in science focused on the problem of oceanic navigation. After numerous false starts and scores of dead ends the solution becomes more and more obvious. The key to determining longitude lies in developing a highly accurate time piece. A daunting task considering the harsh environment of a rolling ship on the high seas. Twenty essays from twenty different authors approach the subject from different perspectives with surprising little redundancy.

4814,1421: The Year China Discovered America,Gavin Menzies,3.58,11111,909,Andrew,1,"There are books that break new ground with bombshell research and there are books that spellbind us with the skill of their deception. This book is the latter. Menzies takes a tremendous dump on the sensibilities of his readers, bombarding us with outrageous claims backed up with erroneous facts and arrogant speculation. A typical ""fact"" presented by Menzies is introduced with ""By this point I was sure..."" or ""I realized that Zhou must have...."" or even ""From my days as a navigator, I knew that ...."" Then Menzies will absurdly postulate about what the Treasure Fleet MUST have been doing in uncharted territory, with no trace of written or oral record, halfway across the globe nearly 600 years ago. He claims he knows the exact date that the the Fleet passed certain islands in the Caribbean due to their haphazard presence and occurrence on later European charts (the absence of the moon excuses when these oddly shaped islands are misrepresented or missed on the charts). Then he will wax appreciatively about how precise Chinese navigators and cartographers were, attributing stone structures (Menzies' alleged observation decks) all around the globe to Chinese astronomical prowess and their desire to properly construct latitude and longitude by measuring eclipses all across the globe. Of course, the Chinese never bothered to go back to these places to collect the results. Nor did they return to the dozens of colonies they set up everywhere from South America to Massachusetts to Gympie, Australia. Nor did they return to collect the fruits of the mines they set up all over the world. Menzies will say that this is because of the isolationist policy China soon after adopted. But if you really think about, and if you read later editions' postscripts and visit his website - you will soon realize that he is trying to collect all of the unaccountables and unexplainables of history and wrap them up in a flimsy and manipulative description of a massive journey and colonization campaign that most likely never even happened. This book is the nadir of pop history, and, sadly, it shows how dedicated propagandists have been stretching history to their own means for centuries - mix your audience's curiosity and ignorance with a fantastical proposition and then support it with smart and thorough sounding explanations based on baseless facts, and then sit back and let their imagination take hold.It may be added that the HMS Rorqual, the submarine that Menzies briefly commanded, experienced its only collision under his steerage.

687,"Natural Hormone Balance for Women: Look Younger, Feel Stronger, and Live Life with Exuberance",Uzzi Reiss,4.06,124,14,Liss,4,"Because Dr Reiss gives detailed advice for each major sex hormone, offering dosages to start at for women depending on their symptoms and state of reproductive health (young, perimenopause, menopause, etc) this book is quite helpful as a beginning text for women hoping to find remedies to mood/weight/metabolic ills that they suspect are linked to sex hormone imbalances. I also appreciate his detailed explanations of the different methods of taking the hormones and advice on which are likely to work best for different women. His warning about sex hormone binding globulin has solved one of my own medical mysteries, so I'm quite thankful he took the time to explain that aspect of hormone use to his readers.Dr Reiss gets special kudos from me for acknowledging what so many doctors don't: carb restriction is an absolute MUST for most women with health challenges. High insulin is one of the biggest hormonal bogeymen. Without first addressing the blood sugar/insulin roller coaster many women ride, there's little hope for optimal wellbeing.I wish the text were a little livelier and had a few illustrations. I also suspect that progesterone is not as helpful as Dr Reiss suggests in this book. I would highly recommend this book to others, but advise them to check out Vliet's work for an alternate take on progesterone."
685,The Natural,Bernard Malamud,3.62,8438,635,Brina,4,"As baseball season heats up, I find myself gravitating toward baseball related books in order to enhance my love for the game when I am not listening to or watching a game. Today I read Bernard Malamud's The Natural, which I rate 3.6 stars. I have seen the movie version of this book in which Robert Redford's character hits a game winning homer to clinch the pennant, shattering lights, creating his own fireworks, with memorable music in the background. The written version, unfortunately, is not as upbeat, and has a dark undertone to it. It begins the same as the movie as young Roy Hobbs is traveling to Chicago with his scout and mentor Sam Simpson to have a tryout with the Cubs. En route their train stops at a county fair and major league star The Whammer, resembling Babe Ruth, happens to be on the same train. A newspaperman challenges the two to a baseball duel, and Hobbs strikes out the Whammer on three pitches. A legend is born. Yet, in Chicago, a disturbed woman obsessed with striking down star athletes guns down Hobbs in her hotel room, and he disappears from organized baseball. Fast forward fifteen years, and Hobbs resurfaces as a thirty five year rookie on the New York Knights, albeit with a mysterious past that he wishes to keep secret. The book follows the same trajectory as the movie in that Bump Bailey is killed running into a wall, and Hobbs takes his place in the middle of the lineup. Immediately he starts hitting, and two women take notice: Memo, niece of Knights long suffering manager Pop Fisher and Iris, a black haired young grandmother in Chicago. The rest of the book includes Hobbs' internal battle as to which life course to follow and which woman he would rather be with, as much as his quest to give Pop Fisher the pennant and allow both men to end their careers on a positive note. Whereas the movie ended on the positive note and neatly tied up loose ends, the book's final scenes are dark and paint a picture of a flawed, fallen hero. We are left wondering if Roy chooses Iris or if he goes back to the shadows from whence he came never to play ball again. For those expecting the fireworks, they will be disappointed. I was left with a slightly bitter feel when I finished this classic. I rated it as high as I did because it does contain some fun baseball scenes as well as Malamud's prolific prose. I would still recommend this as a book that baseball fans should read in their lifetimes, yet it is one of those rare occasions where the movie is better than the book. A perfect read for baseball season, 3.6 stars."
686,"Natural Speaker, The (5th Edition) (MySpeechKit Series)",Randy Fujishin,3.42,67,11,Thomas III,3,"As a more seasoned speaker who had to get over my own fear, I walked away with some good reinforcement of what I knew. I know the book is targeted for college students, but there are times when the details get so specific that it's hard to see the experiential learning opportunities. Some of the chapter-starting stories give a good introduction to the ensuing content, but can be perceived as overwhelming to the some readers. The depth of the detail can almost be deflating. When taken in smaller doses, which can happen during a classroom setting, I see the value of the book. However, there are certain points I disagreed with. There are blanket statements that were meant to resonate with all speakers. The author didn't take into accounts different learning styles, different methods, and comfort level at the individual level. For example, it's noted to find a quiet and private practice site. That may be good to start, but what happens when you go live and there are everyday distractions like paper rustling in a classroom, or side chatter going on? When a speaker gets too comfortable into routine is when the issues start to occur with delivery and delivering the content. Even as simple as the common recommendation of practicing in front of a mirror, the author made a strong stance that it's ""not helpful."" My take is that a speaker must be comfortable with themselves first before they can get comfortable with an audience. I wouldn't suggest making it the sole practice technique, but as a supportive way of learning about gesture and facial expressions, I would highly recommend it, especially when student aren't comfortable with themselves. There are some nuggets in here, and overall the book is a decent start for newer speakers. - Thomas B. Dowd III"
6163,"The Border Trilogy: All the Pretty Horses, The Crossing, Cities of the Plain",Cormac McCarthy,4.43,4766,285,Laura,5,"I have this vague idea of going back and writing reviews of some of my favorite books, read long before I heard of Goodreads. And yet strangely, it’s somehow harder to write reviews of the books I love the best. I’m not sure why that is- maybe it’s because I feel SO MUCH for the books that are like old, beloved friends, that combing through all my weighty feelings and associations with them to find the right words is almost impossible. So there is my disclaimer that this will probably be a rambling, besotted jumble of thoughts, more than a true review.I have a great deal of respect for Cormac McCarthy’s talent, and have been impressed by everything I have ever read by him. That said, these three books are the only ones that I truly love. I love almost everything about them, the unique, gorgeous poetry of McCarthy’s syntax and the depth of his philosophy, the complexity of his primary characters, who I love dearly. I also love how deeply he draws on numerous archetypes and myths that span almost every era of World Literature. You can delve deep with McCarthy, folks- as deep as any literary-analysis loving English major/book nerd dares to go. Personally, I wrote a 30 page paper on the role of myth and legend in the trilogy for a graduate level literature class, and it was my favorite paper that I wrote in college. There was just SO MUCH to sink my teeth into, and I never enjoyed analyzing literature so much before or since. The first book in the trilogy is the most famous, winner of the National Book Award, frequently on AP Literature exams, etc. (And also, sadly, the inspiration for an absolutely horrid film version starring Matt Damon.) All the Pretty Horses is the boyhood story of John Grady Cole, a post World War version of a questing knight. His journey into the wild open land of Mexico, in search of a world that no longer exists (if it ever did, outside of stories) is at the simplest level a brilliantly drawn coming of age story. But instead of the clichéd resolution (adolescent loses his innocence and idealism after facing harsh realities/darkness of life) John Grady, the true Quixotic hero, manages to find a path where the idealism and belief in beauty outlives the innocence, and I think that’s a gorgeous thing. The second book in the trilogy, The Crossing, is my favorite of the three. I love the two young brothers, Billy and Boyd, so very much, and McCarthy’s writing is so raw and beautiful it sometimes physically hurts. I also love his brilliant incorporation of the Corrido (Spanish ballads about oppression, history and tragedy, and often Quixotic reform) and the social bandit/outlaw myth. But it’s Billy’s story most of all, how his deeply sensitive nature is both shaped by and shapes fate, and how he is destined to love and try desperately to save wild, doomed creatures- both human and animal. I really can’t say much more about this one, because I’ll end up either giving copious spoilers or crying, or both.The third and final book, Cities of the Plain, covers much more time, and completes the stories of the two protagonists from the other books, Billy and John Grady. While in my opinion this is the weakest in the trilogy, McCarthy’s weakest is still better than most contemporary novels I have read. And I love the relationship that develops between Billy and John Grady, and how seamless and authentic their characterization is throughout the trilogy. While any of the three books can be read alone, in my opinion they shouldn’t be. The full effect of McCarthy’s poignant story about these two young men, and all they loved and lost , only comes from reading all three together. "
6166,Music of Silence: A Sacred Journey Through the Hours of the Day,David Steindl-Rast,4.22,116,17,Louanne Enns,3,"Read this little book in preparation for and on a Quiet Retreat. It was a helpful overview of the monastic hours of the day and the gifts each hour brings. A great book to read to help re-cover a sense of the rhythms of our days and years. I particularly like the chapter on the hour of Prime in that it is a deliberate ""assigning of the work"" for each day that begs one to pause and consider what is to be done. The reminder to not begin in the middle, but to pause and start each day anew, is sage advice. Also helpful is taking the view that all of our work is common work (for the common good, that is) regardless of us being alone when we accomplish it. The other gem in this book is the discovery of a ""monastic coffee break""- Terce. The third hour, in which the focus is on being filled with and alive in the Holy Spirit comes from the apostles being accused of drunkeness at Pentecost: ""We are not drunk, after all it is but the third hour!"" Terce, then, allows one to pause in their work after several hours and re-focus by inviting the Holy Spirit to bring His life and strength to our hearts and work. A lot of great insight in a small book. Certainly worth a read for those who feel like the hours of the day are their enemy."
6168,The Music of Silence: A Memoir,Andrea Bocelli,3.78,174,27,Suzyqb87,5,"musicofsilenceYou know me. I love reading fiction. However, I chose to read Andrea Bocelli's autobiography, ""The Music of Silence: A Memoir,"" out of curiosity for this man whose voice has the warmth of a cozy fire, resonance of a cello, and familiar tone of a father's words. What kind of life produced such a singer? Bocelli's poetic life story begins humbly in Italy. He was not, as I learned, blind since birth, but rather suffered from the disease of glaucoma, which took his eyesight. Knocks and hits during a football match exacerbated the deterioration, until at age twelve he could no longer even see light nor shapes as he formerly could. But Bocelli's life is only flavored by blindness, not defined by it. I found this phrase, which the townspeople said about him, incredibly poignant: ""Nature has taken something away from him, but it has also given him something beautiful."" Bocelli's mother was trying to soothe her anguished young son crying from pain, when she noticed her son reaching for the wall and staying quiet in order to listen to strains of music. Acting on instinct, she sought out the source, which was a man singing. From there, the whole family realized Bocelli loved music. They nurtured this love by buying him albums and lessons constantly. For me, this was powerful, to see how he recognized their support and cultivation of music for him from early childhood.I was also captivated by his faith in the Lord. Words of wisdom filter through this book like rays of light in a forest. Reading it felt pleasurably as if I was watching a popular, happy movie and gradually realizing it was a true story. Bocelli's mellifluous words (I suspect translated from the original Italian) are poetic, evocative and purposeful. His writing speaks of a depth of soul rarely seen, as well as years of rigorous and classical education (he quotes Quirinius, for goodness' sake!). However, he is still a real person. Bocelli makes mention of first loves and lusts, his passion for horses (who knew?), his extreme anxiety going on-stage but a trickling sense of pride at singing for others, his youthful rebellion, desire to do dangerous things as a young man, and the annoyance of having others pity him or help him unnecessarily for being blind. I was amazed to read about his trepidation before having a child, saying he had never felt the urge to be a father, though the idea of a child interested him. Then, he spoke of the overwhelming love for his children which grew upon holding them that first time. Bocelli speaks of the temptations of the music industry, the long travel, commitment to protecting his voice (no soda, less alcohol, absolute silence on the day of a concert!) and how (before he was famous) the fear of providing for his family (he studied law to have a steady career). He says often how vulnerable he feels in writing this book and baring his secrets and personal life to the world, but Bocelli says he does so in order to help others live fully. To me, it felt earnest and noble.I honestly cannot fully describe to you the power of this man's language, especially in the Epilogue. Bocelli is no singing puppet; if anything, his richly beautiful tenor voice is but an echo of a profound soul. I would love to read this book again and again. "
6154,Embracing the Beloved: Relationship as a Path of Awakening,Stephen Levine,4.17,101,6,Steve Woods,4,"When I first started to read this book I found it pretty hard to relate to; a little too saccharine around the idea of relationships for me. No doubt conditioned by my own experiences, it all just felt like California mamby pamby to me. My sense of disappointment came from my great enjoyment and learning that resulted from all of Levine's work I had read before this one. It surprised me a bit when either, he cut to the chase or something shifted in me to allow me to see that he was addressing directly the core of my current dilemna. The Beloved is that which is in us all, our reconciliation, the ability for forgiveness and to extend mercy to ourselves; the healing of the primary wound IS the basis for all relationship. While ever we remain disconnected to that deeper part of self, we are incapable of relating intimately to any other human being. All is pretense and delusion.I now stand at that crossroads and here is a signpost pointing the way. As always I find myself humbled by this man and grateful for his efforts towards the enlightenment of all beings, including me!"
6162,All the Pretty Horses,Cormac McCarthy,3.97,74099,4892,Kemper,4,"All the Pretty Horses isn’t quite as grim as other Cormac McCarthy work that I’ve read but considering that this includes The Road, Blood Meridian, No Country For Old Men and watching the HBO adaptation of his play The Sunset Limited, it's still so bleak that your average person will be depressed enough to be checked into a mental ward and put on suicide watch after finishing it.John Grady Cole is a sixteen year old cowboy in Texas a few years after World War II who was raised on his grandfather’s ranch after his parents split up. After his grandfather dies, the ranch is being sold off. With no where else to go, John and his best friend Lacey Rawlins ride off for Mexico. Along the way they hook up with a runaway kid who is nothing but bad news. After getting work on a large ranch, John catches the owner’s eye with his skill working with horses, but after being promoted, John falls in love with the owner’s daughter which leads to trouble for him and Rawlins.I guess you could say that this is a tragic romance or a coming-of-age story, but that’s like comparing The Road to the The Road Warrior. Or saying that Blood Meridian is just a western. Or calling No Country For Old Men a simple crime story. There’s a lot more going on than just a couple of kids running off to play cowboy. John and Rawlins get their eyes harshly opened to just how cruel and unforgiving the world can be and that pleasures like young love can’t possibly hope to endure in the face of that.As usual, McCarthy's views on life and death and good and evil won’t leave any sane person skipping down the street while whistling and looking for rainbows, but he’s so skilled that even his grim outlook has a kind of dark beauty to it."

La personale rivisitazione dell'Iliade da parte di Baricco permette di rendere accessibile un'opera non così immediata e questo non può che essere un pregio.La vicenda viene chiaramente rimaneggiata ed adattata per esigenze editoriali, ma tutto ciò non preclude gli ottimi spunti ereditati direttamente da Omero e riproposti con la medesima forza anche qui.Degna di nota la coraggiosissima postfazione sulla guerra, realtà capace di esaltare le gesta ed ideali di chi si sottrae al grigiore di una quotidianità vuota e senza stimoli.Il suo commento non è tanto un apprezzamento della guerra quanto l'ammirazione dell'anomala bellezza di un eroe senza nome che muore sul campo di battaglia.Finché l'uomo non identifichera' la bellezza all'interno del suo microcosmo, sarà irrimediabilmente costretto a cercarla altrove.Discorso brillante, sul filo del rasoio."

  A NOTE ON THE TEXT
Before I continue, I want to comment on the version I read/listened to because I think can be critical to people’s reaction to the story. There are a TRUCKLOAD of Odyssey translations out there and, from what I’ve seen, they range wider in quality and faithfulness to the original text than those of almost any other work of Western Literature. These versions can differ so much that I believe two people with identical reading tastes could each read a different translation and walk away with vastly different opinions on the work. The version I am reviewing (and from which the above quote is derived) is the Robert Fagles translation which uses contemporary prose and structure while remaining faithful to the content of the original. I found it a terrific place for a “first experience” with this work because of how easy to follow it was. Plus, I listened to the audio version read by Sir Ian McKellen which was an amazing experience and one I HIGHLY RECOMMEND. In addition to the Fagles version, I also own the Alexander Pope translation as part of my Easton Press collection of The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written. While listening to the Fagles version, I would often follow along with the Pope translation and let me tell you....they are vastly different. While the overall story is the same, the presentation, prose and the structure are nothing alike. As an example, here is the same passage I quoted earlier from the Pope translation. 
  Then forth they led [______], and beganTheir bloody work; they lopp’d away the man,Morsel for dogs! then trimm’d with brazen shears The wretch, and shorten’d of his nose and ears;His hands and feet last felt the cruel steel;He roar’d, and torments gave his soul to hell.They wash, and to Ulysses take their way:So ends the bloody business of the day.
 Very different treatments of the same scene. In my opinion, the Pope language is more beautiful and far more poetic and lyrical than the Fagles translation. However, I am glad I started with the Fagles version because it provided me with a much better comprehension of the story itself. No head-scratching moments. Now that I have a firm grounding in the story, I plan to go back at some point and read the Pope version so that I can absorb the greater beauty of that translation. In a nutshell, I'm saying that you should make sure you find a translation that works for you. That’s my two or three cents. 
  THE STORY
So Odysseus, master strategist and tactician (not to mention schemer, manipulator and liar extraordinaire), travels home to Ithaca after the Trojan War. Delays and detours ensue which take up the first half of the story. Most of these travel snags are caused by Poseidon, who is grudging on Odysseus for stick-poking Poseidon’s son (i.e. the Cyclops) in the peeper. Not to fear, Athena (goddess of guile and craftiness) is a proud sponsor of Odysseus and, along with some help for big daddy god Zeus, throws Odysseus some Olympian help. Odysseus’ travels are full of great summer blockbuster-like entertainment and at the same time explore all manner of Greek daily life as well as touching on many of their beliefs and traditions. It really is a perfect blend of fun and brain food. From his time on the island homes of the goddesses Calypso and Circe (who he gets busy with despite his “undying” love for his wife, Penelope...men huh?), to his run ins with the giant Laestrygonians and the Lotus-eaters (i.e., thugs and drugs) and his fateful encounter with the Cyclops, Polyphemus. Odysseus even takes a jaunt to the underworld where he speaks to Achilles and gets to listen to dead king Agamemnon go on an anti-marriage rant because his conniving wife poisoned him to death. Homer does a superb job of keeping the story epic while providing the reader with wonderful details about the life of the greek people during this period. The man had story-telling chops.. Meanwhile, while Odysseus is engaged in the ancient greek version of the Amazing Race, back on Ithaca we’ve got a full-fledged version of the Bachelorette going on as over a hundred suitors are camped out at Odysseus pad trying to get Penelope to give them a rose. This has Odysseus’ son, Telemachus, on the rage because the suitors are eating, drinking and servant-boinking him out of his entire inheritance while they wait on Penelope. You might think that Telemachus could just kick the freeloaders out, but the law of “hospitality” was huge for the Greeks and the suitor-douches use it to full advantage. Well Odysseus eventually makes it back to Ithaca, alone and in disguise, after all of this crew have been eaten, squashed, drowned or otherwise rendered life-impaired. Not an easy place to live is ancient Greece. Odysseus proceeds to work a web of deceit and revenge against the suitors that is a wonder to behold. I’ll leave the final climax to you, but I will say that there was no free lunch in Homer’s time and the checks that people wrote with their bad behavior are paid in full.
  MY THOUGHTS
 This was a fun, fun, fun read. I want to start with that because this is not one of those classics that I think is worth while only to get it under your belt or checked off a list. This was a great story with great characters and in a style that was both “off the usual path” but still easy to follow. Going back to my comments on the various versions of the story, I think this may end up being a five star read in one of the more flowery, densely poetic translations where the emotion and passion is just a bit more in your face. I am still thrilled to have listened to the version I did (especially as read by Gandalf) because I now have a firm foundation in the story and can afford to be a bit more adventurous with my next version. The tone of the story is heroic and yet very dark. The gods are capricious and temperamental and cause a whole lot of death and devastation for nothing more than a bruised ego or even a whim. The pace of the story is fast and moves quickly with hardly a chance to even catch your breath. It is a big epic story...it is THE BIG EPIC STORY...and its reputation is well deserved. A terrific read as well as one of the most important works in the Western canon. Definitely worth your time. 4.5 stars. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!! "

1380,The Iliad,Homer,3.83,278052,4884,Grace Tjan,4,"What I learned from this book (in no particular order):1.	Victory or defeat in ancient Greek wars is primarily the result of marital spats and/or petty sibling rivalry in Zeus and Hera’s dysfunctional divine household.2.	Zeus “the father of gods and men” is a henpecked husband who is also partial to domestic abuse.3.	If you take a pretty girl who is the daughter of a priest of Apollo as war booty and refuse to have her ransomed, Apollo will rain plague on your troops. And he won’t be appeased until you return the girl and throw him a ginormous BBQ party involving hundreds of cattle at his temple.4.	If an arrow or a spear were thrown at you in battle, more often than not, it would land on your nipple or thereabout. Or alternatively, it would pierce your helmet and splatter your brain.5.	Paris is a proper guy’s name, not just a name for capital cities or bratty heiresses.6.	Brad Pitt in man skirt* Achilles is the badassest warrior there ever was.7.	Real men eat red meat, specifically:				a. sheep chines;				b. fat goats; and				c. the long back cuts of a full-grown pig, marbled with lard.8.	 The most valuable booty are (in no particular order):					a. bronze tripods (each worth 12 oxens) and armors;				b. swift war stallions; and				c. pretty women (each worth 4 oxens, if also skilled in crafts). Lesbians are particularly prized.		9.	There is nothing more glorious for a warrior than to sack enemy cities, plunder their wealth, kill all their men, bed their pretty women and enslave their children. 	10. 	The only men who matter are warriors, but if you are a woman, the range of roles that you could play is rather more diverse. You could be:a.	a runaway wife who sparks a cosmic battle between your thuggish hubby’s city-state and your cowardly boyfriend’s (1);b.	a war booty with a bad case of Stockholm Syndrome (2);c.	a manipulative uber bitch (who also happens to be a goddess) (3);d.	a long-suffering wife and mother (4).(1) Helen	(2) Briseis	(3) Hera	(4) AndromacheBut whatever role you choose to play, you will still be the bone of contention between men and the armies that they lead. All the major conflicts in the story are triggered by women, or specifically by their sexuality: Helen’s elopement with Paris launched a thousand Argive ships against Troy; Agamemnon’s desire to bed Briseis, Achilles’ lawful prize, caused a nearly unhealable rift between them; and Hector’s desire to protect his wife from the dismal fate of being an Argive sex slave inspired him to fight Achilles to the death. Homer’s mortal women might be meek and mild, but his goddesses can kick ass with the best of them, and even occasionally best their male counterparts: Zeus is not above being manipulated by Hera, and Ares the God of War actually got whacked on the head by Athena. *Troy, Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Warner Bros. 2004.What I find most surprising about the Iliad is the amount of graphic, X-rated violence that it contains. The violence is not the biblical slaying and smiting, but something much more voyeuristically gory:“…the one Peneleos lanced beneath the brows, down to the eyes' roots and scooped an eyeball out --- the spear cut clean through the socket, out behind the nape and backward down he sat, both hands stretched wide as Peneleos, quickly drawing his whetted sword, hacked him square in the neck and lopped his head and down on the ground it tumbled, helmet and all. But the big spear's point still stuck in the eye socket ---.""I imagine that this kind of anatomically precise, brain-splattering, gut-spilling action scenes made the Iliad popular with the Romans, who routinely went to the Colosseum to watch gladiators hack each other to death, but there is only so much of it that I could take in one sitting, which is why it took me almost three months to finish it. It is not that I’m particularly sensitive to fictional death and dismemberment --- and after all, this book is a war book --- but the sheer amount of such scenes, as well as their mind-numbing repetitiveness made for tedious reading. It doesn’t help that many of these deaths happened to seemingly throwaway characters, barely introduced in three or four lines, merely to be summarily (and gorily) dispatched in another half a dozen lines on the same page. The Iliad is assumed to be the written version of a much older oral poem, and such characters might represent collective memories of real Bronze Age warriors, but by Zeus, hundreds of pages of them being hacked, cleaved and skewered to death almost did me in.Now, what is the purpose of such meticulously catalogued carnage? Was Homer trying to present War with all its attendant horrors to shock his audience into pacifism? Or was the old guy just trying to write an 8th century BCE equivalent of a blockbuster action-adventure movie with enough gore to satisfy his young male demographic? The Iliad both celebrates and laments the warrior spirit: the haughty pride and terrible thirst for vengeance and plunder that set men to distant shores, intent on razing cities and putting its inhabitants to slaughter, but also the stark, tragic consequences of such acts. I actually find the gods’ politicking and manipulations more interesting than the actual war. The Greek gods are blissfully free of any human notion of morality --- which makes the problem of theodicy much more simpler to solve than in the Judeo-Christian model. The Olympian gods do not move in mysterious ways: they are moved by caprice and petty grievances. Why did we suffer such an ignominious defeat, despite all that we had done to win Zeus’ favor? Well, it happened that just before the battle was about to begin, Hera seduced him and subsequently put him to sleep with the help of Hypnos, whom she bribed with one of the Graces. A perfectly logical and very human explanation.The story gets much more interesting in the last five books. The Olympian gods entered into the fray and the effect is sometimes like watching WWE SmackDown: “Bloody Ares lunged at it now with giant lance and Athena backed away, her powerful hand heftinga boulder off the plain, black, jagged, a ton weightthat men in the old days planted there to make off plowland ---Pallas hurled that boundary-stone at Ares, struck his neck,loosed his limbs, and down he crashed and out over seven acressprawled the enormous god and his mane dragged in the dust.”Or maybe an episode of Super Friends :“How do you have the gall, you shameless bitch,to stand and fight me here? ….But since you’d like a lesson in warfare, Artemis,just to learn, to savor how much stronger I amwhen you engage my power ---“The gods are “deathless”, so you know that there won’t be any lasting harm from their catfight, but the cost of battle to all too mortal men is heavy indeed. This was a time when war was as elemental as they come: no mercy was shown to the enemy on the battlefield, save one that pertained to a warrior’s honor, which was to be buried with full honors by his family and comrades. When mighty, “stallion-breaking” Hector finally succumbed to Achilles in a strangely anticlimactic duel, his father Priam went to Achilles’ camp and“kneeling down beside Achilles, clasped his kneesand kissed his hands, those terrible, man-killing handsthat had slaughtered Priam’s many sons in battle.”Troy’s old king begged for his son’s body, and in the magnificent, poignant last book, Homer showed us the real cost of war, both on the vanquished and the triumphant. By the will of the gods, Achilles’ death would soon follow: his destiny was ultimately no different from the rest of tragic humanity, fated to suffer and die by callous, immoral gods for causes that were entirely beyond their ken.“So the immortals spun our lives that we, we wretched menlive on to bear such torments ---“"

While the overall story is the same, the presentation, prose and the structure are nothing alike. As an example, here is the same passage I quoted earlier from the Pope translation. 
  Then forth they led [______], and beganTheir bloody work; they lopp’d away the man,Morsel for dogs! then trimm’d with brazen shears The wretch, and shorten’d of his nose and ears;His hands and feet last felt the cruel steel;He roar’d, and torments gave his soul to hell.They wash, and to Ulysses take their way:So ends the bloody business of the day.
 Very different treatments of the same scene. In my opinion, the Pope language is more beautiful and far more poetic and lyrical than the Fagles translation. However, I am glad I started with the Fagles version because it provided me with a much better comprehension of the story itself. No head-scratching moments. Now that I have a firm grounding in the story, I plan to go back at some point and read the Pope version so that I can absorb the greater beauty of that translation. In a nutshell, I'm saying that you should make sure you find a translation that works for you. That’s my two or three cents. 
  THE STORY
So Odysseus, master strategist and tactician (not to mention schemer, manipulator and liar extraordinaire), travels home to Ithaca after the Trojan War. Delays and detours ensue which take up the first half of the story. Most of these travel snags are caused by Poseidon, who is grudging on Odysseus for stick-poking Poseidon’s son (i.e. the Cyclops) in the peeper. Not to fear, Athena (goddess of guile and craftiness) is a proud sponsor of Odysseus and, along with some help for big daddy god Zeus, throws Odysseus some Olympian help. Odysseus’ travels are full of great summer blockbuster-like entertainment and at the same time explore all manner of Greek daily life as well as touching on many of their beliefs and traditions. It really is a perfect blend of fun and brain food. From his time on the island homes of the goddesses Calypso and Circe (who he gets busy with despite his “undying” love for his wife, Penelope...men huh?), to his run ins with the giant Laestrygonians and the Lotus-eaters (i.e., thugs and drugs) and his fateful encounter with the Cyclops, Polyphemus. Odysseus even takes a jaunt to the underworld where he speaks to Achilles and gets to listen to dead king Agamemnon go on an anti-marriage rant because his conniving wife poisoned him to death. Homer does a superb job of keeping the story epic while providing the reader with wonderful details about the life of the greek people during this period. The man had story-telling chops.. Meanwhile, while Odysseus is engaged in the ancient greek version of the Amazing Race, back on Ithaca we’ve got a full-fledged version of the Bachelorette going on as over a hundred suitors are camped out at Odysseus pad trying to get Penelope to give them a rose. This has Odysseus’ son, Telemachus, on the rage because the suitors are eating, drinking and servant-boinking him out of his entire inheritance while they wait on Penelope. You might think that Telemachus could just kick the freeloaders out, but the law of “hospitality” was huge for the Greeks and the suitor-douches use it to full advantage. Well Odysseus eventually makes it back to Ithaca, alone and in disguise, after all of this crew have been eaten, squashed, drowned or otherwise rendered life-impaired. Not an easy place to live is ancient Greece. Odysseus proceeds to work a web of deceit and revenge against the suitors that is a wonder to behold. I’ll leave the final climax to you, but I will say that there was no free lunch in Homer’s time and the checks that people wrote with their bad behavior are paid in full.
  MY THOUGHTS
 This was a fun, fun, fun read. I want to start with that because this is not one of those classics that I think is worth while only to get it under your belt or checked off a list. This was a great story with great characters and in a style that was both “off the usual path” but still easy to follow. Going back to my comments on the various versions of the story, I think this may end up being a five star read in one of the more flowery, densely poetic translations where the emotion and passion is just a bit more in your face. I am still thrilled to have listened to the version I did (especially as read by Gandalf) because I now have a firm foundation in the story and can afford to be a bit more adventurous with my next version. The tone of the story is heroic and yet very dark. The gods are capricious and temperamental and cause a whole lot of death and devastation for nothing more than a bruised ego or even a whim. The pace of the story is fast and moves quickly with hardly a chance to even catch your breath. It is a big epic story...it is THE BIG EPIC STORY...and its reputation is well deserved. A terrific read as well as one of the most important works in the Western canon. Definitely worth your time. 4.5 stars. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!! "
4458,Denial of the Soul,M. Scott Peck,3.72,136,10,K.,3,"After finishing this book and chewing on it, I realized that M. Scott Peck has a view similar to Emily Dickinson: He believes that death is an ideal space for encountering God. Yes, he has ""euthanasia"" in his title, but what he's really calling for is a rejection of secularism that has overtaken the discussion, the policies and the processes of death and dying. He's trying to reinsert God, spirituality and religiosity into what has become mainly a legal, medical and ""rational"" set of choices of the an individual's will. Again, this book is not about the right to die; it's really about the need for people to relinquish control and to accept God's will in their lives--and the act of dying is a place that even the most stubborn control freak is most compelled to acquiese control if all other events in their life prior have failed to convince them of their own limits. If I have a reason for giving this only 3 stars, it's because Peck takes us around the block and over hill and dale (setting up key terms and explaining his assumptions) before getting to his major claim. So discussing euthanasia is actually Peck's means and not his end, but he does spend some time (although maybe only 20% of the text) talking about the topic of euthanasia directly or just slightly askew. He calls for a careful balance between prolonging the dying process long enough to encounter God but keeping it free from unnecessary suffering caused either by 1) too much medical intervention when the body wants to die and 2) too little administration of drugs that can help the body and soul relinquish and accept death that is absolutely imminant. Now to explain how he spends more than 200 pages getting to this point and why 80% of the book seems so tangential to euthanasia. Peck's book examines the patch of real estate that at first seems to exist among these three tensions: the trajectory of the body towards decay and death; the power of the medical community to use drugs, surgery and machines to sustain life; and the individual's (or family's) will to choose how to act in response. He then does a TON of work to establish some of his premises about the psyche before foregrounding a fourth tension: the will of God in determinine when and how we die. This I found to be the most interesting and unique aspect of the book, and I was hoping for more case studies / narrative detail of individuals wrestling between those four forces: the body, the medicine, the individual's will and God's will. However, he ends more with a call to action: ""People, think about God more in the debates about end of life!"" asks Peck. I agree. But I would have better enjoyed him leading by example. Nevertheless, it asks some good questions and describes the issues in pretty good detail. I prefer some chapters over others, so let me break it down for those who are interested in how he sets up his argument (which goes on a walk around the block in the middle, IMHO). Ch 1: Pulling the Plug: an overview of the events and challenges of end-of-life.Ch 2: Physical Pain: This was informative to me, since I am not a medical professional, and I have not been close to anyone in the dying process. Ch 3: Emotional Pain: Here he used many examples from his psychiatric practice, including those who suffer from depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Ch 4: Murder, Suicide and Natural Death: A philosophical definition of terms. I see this as part of his efforts to say what he is not describing. But he has some compassionat descriptions of people dying from these causes as well as identifying some ""gray areas.""Ch 5: Secularism: Here he describes various postures that people can take towards religion, God and spirituality. Ch 6: The Creaturelinss of Humans: Here he describes his terms and formulas for describing the human mind/ego/soul. (And then emphasizes as he does throughout that these things are beyond formula and beyond description). Ch 7: The Learning of Dying. To me this is the CORE of the book: What is God trying to teach us during the process of dying? And why is it such hard work to be a good student to these lessons?Ch 8: Euthanasia: A Typical Case. Here he describes an end-of-life choice that he found totally devoid of God, spirituality and religiousity. Ch 9: Assisted Suicide: Here he talks about some current publications and some case studies of people more involved in end-of-life decisions. I find that he gets a little manic and unfocused. I think he built up to a great solution to the problem, but he concedes that deciding how to act in the face of dying is really still a gray thing, a personal thing, a complex thing to discuss. He's temped by formulas and guidelines. (He's an admitted control freak.) But he always caustions against them--even when using them here and there. He doesn't want Easy Answers, but he wants 1) something different than how the medical community can sometimes prolong emotional and physical suffering that occurs in the dying process and 2) something different than the quick decision some people make to take their lives before they get a chance to encounter God and perform some soul-changing psycho-spiritual work that the dying process invites.Ch 10: The Hope of the Euthanasia Debate: The title says it all. He really wants to see people complicate the debate on euthanasia and foreground more the psychological and spiritual growth that can come at end of life. He wants less suffering physically, emotionaly and spiritually. Exactly how this will happen and how this will look is still vague. Here is a key quote from his conclusion:""I believe the major underlying disease is the secularism of U.S. society as manifested in its denial of the soul. The greatest hope I can see on the horizon for the healing of this disease lies in the euthanasia debate. If many are willing to think deeply about the issues of the debate, then many will encounter their own souls, often for the first time"" (232)."
4461,PEOPLE OF THE LIE VOL. 3 POSSESSION AND GROUP EVIL: Possession and Group Evil,M. Scott Peck,3.96,5799,424,Joanna,4,"""Evil can be conquered only by love."" ""To somehow be tolerant and intolerant."" ""An almost Godlike compassion is required.""--------""Okay George, I'm going to say a few things to you and I want you to listen to them well. Because they are very important. Nothing is more important.""""You have a defect--a weakness--in your character, George. It is a very basic weakness, and it it the cause of all the difficulties we've been talking about. It's the major cause of your bad marriage. It's the cause of your symptoms, your obsessions and compulsions."" ""Basically George, you are a kind of coward. Whenever the going gets a little bit rough, you sell out. When you're faced with the realization that your're going to die one of these days, you run away from it. You don't think about it, because it's 'morbid.' When you're faced with the painful realization that your marriage is lousy, you run away from that too. Instead of facing it and doing something about it, you don't think about that either. And then because your've run away from these things that are really inescapable, they come to haunt you in these form of your symptoms, your obsessions, and compulsions These symptoms could be your salvation, You could say, ""These symptoms mean that I'm haunted. I better find out what these ghosts are, and clean them out of my house.' But you don't say that, because that would mean really facing some things that are painful.. So you try to run away from your symptoms, too. Instead of facing them and what they mean, you try to get rid of them. And when they're not so easy to get rid of, you go running to anything that will give you relief no matter how wicked or evil or destructive. You plead you shouldn't be accountable... because it was [done] under duress. Of course it was [done] under duress. Why else would one do that, except to rid oneself of some kind of suffering?... The question is not duress. The question is how people deal with duress. Some withstand it and overcome it, ennobled. Some break and sell out. You sell out, and I must say, you do it rather easily. Easily. Easy. That's a key word for you, George. You like to think of yourself as easygoing. Joe Cool. And I suppose you are easygoing, but I don't know where you're going easy, except into hell. You're always looking for the easy way out, George. Not the right way. The easy way. Where you're faced with a choice between the right way and the easy way, you'll take the easy way every time. The painless way. In fact, you'll do anything to find the easy way out, even it if means selling your soul.As I said, I'm glad you're feeling guilty. If you didn't feel bad about taking the easy way out, no matter what, then I wouldn't be able to help you... If you're willing to face the painful realities of your life--your terrorful childhood, your miserable marriage, your mortality, your own cowardice--I can be of some assistance. And I am sure that we will succeed. But if all you want is the easiest possible relief form pain, then I expect you are the devil's man, and I don't see any way to help you. ""--------""The feeling that a healthy person often experiences in a relationship with an evil one is revulsion. The feeling of revulsion may be almost instant if the evil encountered is blatant. If the evil is more subtle, the revulsion may develop only gradually as the relationship with the evil one slowly deepens. The feeling of revulsion can be extremely useful to the therapist. It can be a diagnostic tool par excellence. It can signify more truly and rapidly than anything else that the therapist is in the presence of an evil human being."" ""Revulsion is a powerful emotion that causes us to immediately want to avoid, to escape, the revolting presence, And that is exactly the most appropriate thing for a healthy person to do under ordinary circumstances when confronted with an evil presence: to get away from it. Evil is revolting because it is dangerous. It will contaminate or otherwise destroy a person who remains too long in its presence. Unless you know very well what you are doing, the best thing you can do when faced with evil is to run the other way. The revulsion counter-transference is an instinctive or if you will, a God-given and saving early-warning radar system."" p65""There is another reaction that the evil frequently engender in us: confusion. Describing an encounter with an evil person, one woman wrote, it was ""as if I'd suddenly lost my ability to think."" Once again, this reaction is quite appropriate. Lies confuse. The evil are ""people of the lie"" deceiving others as they also build layer upon layer of self-deception. """"While evil people are to be feared, they are also to be pitied.""""It is a thesis of this book that evil can be defined as a specific form of mental illness...""""It is not their sins per se that characterize evil people, rather is is the subtlety and persistence and consistency of their sins. This is because the central defect of the evil is not the sin but the refusal to acknowledge it.""""The words ""image,"" ""appearance,"" and ""outwardly"" are crucial to understanding the morality of evil. While they seem to lack any motivation to BE good, they intensely desire to appear good. Their ""goodness"" is all on a level of pretense. It is, in effect, a lie. This is why they are, the ""people of the lie."" ""Actually, the lie is designed not so much to deceive others as to deceive themselves. They cannot or will not tolerate the pain of self-reproach...Because they are such experts at disguise, it is seldom possible to pinpoint the maliciousness of the evil. The disguise is usually impenetrable. """"It is my experience that evil seems to run in families."" (80)""There is, I suspect, something basically incomprehensible about evil. But if not incomprehensible, it is characteristically inscrutable. The evil always hide their motives with lies.""""If one wants to seek out evil people, the simplest way to do so is to trace them from their victims. The best place to look, then, is among the parents of emotionally disturbed children or adolescents. I do not mean to imply that all emotionally disturbed children are victims of evil or that all such parents are malignant persons. The configuration of evil is present only in a minority of these cases. It is, however, a substantial minority.""""Evil was defined as the use of power to destroy the spiritual growth of others for the purpose of defending and preserving the integrity of our own sick selves.""(199)It may be that the parents described were not themselves suffering, but their families were. And the symptoms of family disorder--depression, suicide, failing grades, --were attributed to the leadership. The suffering of the children was a symptom of the sickness of the parents.""""The relationship between evil and schizophrenia is not only a matter for fascinating speculation but also very serious research. Many (but certainly not all) of the parents of schizophrenic children seem to be ambulatory schizophrenics or evil or both."" ""Wherever there is evil, there is a lie around.""

It also covered - extensively enough - a few things I had not studied at all.

I took no prep courses and barely any tests or practice questions outside of this book and its companion, and received above the score I was aiming for after my second attempt at the test.Its section on Critical Reading contains myriad tips and tricks on how to tackle the passages, which I found helpful - not everyone has the same style for approaching this part of the test, but PR offers good advice. Furthermore, the ""hit list"" of SAT vocabulary is extremely effective. If one can memorize every word this book lists, they will have a good chance of knowing most of the words that will show up on the SAT - the more esoteric words one can find online or by using another source.The section that focuses on math - my academic kryptonite - is wonderful as well. It not only contains all of the actual knowledge one needs to know, such as formulas, but methods and shortcuts that make the math section much easier than it looks. For example, the writers emphasize that one should ""plug in"" the answers to each question instead of attempting to answer each question by using algebra - this came in handy so many times when I took the SAT, and I give all the credit to Princeton Review.The writing section provides plenty of grammar rules and good advice on how to write a high-scoring essay. I did not use this section as much, because my writing score did not need that much improvement, but for someone scoring lower than a 700, reading this section of PR could pull their score up a decent amount.Once again, I highly recommend Princeton Review. If you or your son or daughter or whoever were to read and retain all of the information in this book and take a couple of practice tests, I can almost promise that you will get the score you want on the SAT. While one of the practice tests in my book lacked an answer key, this book's overall helpfulness has made that a non-issue.*a similar review cross-posted on my blog, the quiet voice."

9840,Jasmine and Stars: Reading More Than Lolita in Tehran,Fatemeh Keshavarz,3.61,231,44,Grady McCallie,3,"I'm glad to have read this. I've only read free samples of Reading Lolita in Tehran (RLT), which Jasmine and Stars criticizes. But, it will probably be years before I get around to it, and so I'll capture my reactions to this book while they're fresh:* Jasmine and Stars argues that RLT demonizes Iran and Islam; oversimplifies the complex individuals who make up modern Iran; ignores the country's proud Persian heritage and vibrant modern literary culture; and presents Western literature as a salvation for confused and benighted young Iranians. I'm sure that's not what Azar Nafisi, RLT's author, understood herself to be doing at all. I suspect RLT is better understood as the work of an author who has experienced painful oppression and is writing about how literature has helped her and her students understand their experiences and take greater control of their internal lives. * Keshavarz's book includes some moving and very personal anecdotes; one of her overt purposes is to offer herself as an alternative window, for an American audience, of what it can mean to be Iranian. She grew up with loving, moderate male relatives, deep exposure to Persian poetry, and no apparent difficulty reconciling (Islamic) faith and modernity. That's great as far as it goes, but doesn't invalidate Nafisi's experience. * Perhaps more problematically, all of Keshavarz' stories reflect well on herself, which I take as a bit of a red-flag when an author is using techniques of memoir to persuade a reader. * Keshavarz doesn't address a couple of topics that I wished she had: the distinctions that set Persian culture and faith apart from pan-Islamic culture and religion; and the ways the 1979 Revolution has changed or obliterated aspects of modern Iranian culture and cultural institutions. These might illumine a difference in frame between RLT and Jasmine and Stars. My hunch is that in RLT, Nafisi pours out her scorn on the Revolution in part because of the damage she has seen it do to the Persian cultural heritage and current artists. But Keshavarz appears to read RLT as an attack - or, at least, a dismissal - of not just the Revolution, but of everything Iranian, and I'm wondering how clearly Keshavarz sees the distinction.* If one discounts Keshavarz' critique as failing to engage RLT on its own terms (and again, I haven't read RLT and so can't tell for certain), Jasmine and Stars still has several points to offer: a picture of Keshavarz' childhood; an introduction to a modern poet (Forough Farrokhzad) and a modern novelist (Shahrnush Parsipar) that Keshavarz reveres; and a reminder of the importance of love as a force that transcends conflict and is very much at home in Persian culture."
6259,Birdsong,Sebastian Faulks,4.07,56304,2613,Lance Greenfield,5,"It's as if the author is writing from personal experience. The way that the characters and the atmosphere are built by Sebastian Faulks is just amazing! The reader is taken in to that atmosphere, and shares the feelings of the main character, Stephen. You cannot fail to be totally captivated.Anyone who has served for any significant period in the Armed Forces will instantly relate to the use of black humour to cover the awful reality and horror. Faulks also manages to reflect on how every aspect of life continues, perhaps in the background, as the war goes on. There is a strong and emotive love story. There is a very powerful understanding of the futility of war and its effects on everyone involved, regardless of national allegiance. One of the most poignant parts of the book, for me, is the description of the feelings of the sappers as they tunnel deep below the battlefield, knowing that their counterparts are experiencing the same hopes and fears, only feet away through the awful mud and darkness. Death is never more than a split second away.Note: It makes it even more personal to me as I was in the Royal Engineers (Sappers) during my military career. I'm happy to report, though, that I never had to get involved in the activity of sapping, or tunnelling. Having had the privilege of sitting with Somme veterans, listening to their vivid memories of the trenches and the contacts, and those friends who lost their lives, I can say, with great confidence, that the superb writing of Birdsong takes us as close to being there as is possible.A scene which, some may say, in the greater scheme of the whole book pales into insignificance but is still very well worth mentioning, is the extremely erotic, yet tastefully presented, first sexual encounter between Stephen and Isabelle, which occurs early on in the story. There are other encounters throughout the book, but I found this to be one of the most sexually arousing pieces of writing that I have ever read. It omits just the right amount of detail to allow the reader's imagination to run riot. Amazing!Every emotion is touched during the reading of this book.The title is evocative. I found several reasons to entitle the book this way, not least Stephen's declaration regarding his feelings about birds and the reasons behind those feelings. When you read the book, keep the title in your mind. Seeking the meaning adds an extra dimension to your reading.It is a shame that it is not possible to award six stars to any book that I review, for Birdsong would surely deserve such an award. This one definitely makes it into my lifetime favourite five.I would have no hesitation in recommending Birdsong to absolutely anyone, but most especially to any politician who is thinking about sending young people to their deaths in war.Footnote: I was surprised that The Magic Mountain by Thomas Mann featured in Sebastian Faulks's top one hundred books. It sits right at the opposite end of the gripping to boring spectrum of reading to this magnificent work: Birdsong is gripping."
6261,Birdsong: Fifty-Three Short Poems,Jalaluddin Rumi,4.33,233,16,Jen,3,"Although my sister and her partner (who I consider intelligent readers of poetry) have enjoyed Rumi for years, I have avoided him, probably because he has become so popular he seems like a fad. And though what I say about my sister and her partner is true, they are also seekers of spiritual wisdom in ways that I am not and I associated Rumi with nuggets of spiritual wisdom more than poetry--without actually reading any of his work.Ok, so there is my initial statement of prejudice. I also find I'm going to have to separate my experience of the poems in this book with the method by which they were written.Response to poems:I enjoyed many of them. Fifty are presented. Yes, some are more wisdom nugget than poem but many are simply poems, responses to the world (a bit too often about love), wisdom or not.Sometimes I call you wine, or cup,Sunlight ricocheting off those,or faintly immersed in silver.I call you trap and bait,and the game I'm after, allso as not to say your name.Juxtaposition of opposites and questioning of opposites is common in his poetry.One who does what the Friend wants donewill never need a friend.There's bankruptcy that's pure gain.The moon stays bright with itdoesn't avoid the night.A rose's rarest essencelives in the thorn.So some of them are Koan-like, some of them simply seem like poems, and some are more explicit nuggets of wisdom. The more I read, the more I was reminded of Dickinson with her twists within short poems and her humor, or Cavafy, perhaps because of the emphasis on love, and even Whitman because of the persistent message to embrace life. And of Guiseppi Ungaretti's very brief poem:I hear a dovefrom other floodsBut . . .Skepticism about the way they were written:At the end of the introduction, there's a little note that these are reworkings of the translations of another person. And then I read a bit more thanks to wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coleman_...). I'm going to be a poor scholar and assume what is written there is essentially correct. So it seems to me that Barks is an interpreter of translations rather than a translator. So when I'm reminded of Dickinson, is that because of Barks' American processing of Rumi? Or Barks' love of Dickinson? Because the example of direct translation is not at all brief, is more Whitmanesque in style though not at all Whitmanesque in subject matter and its preference for vagueness. So is the koan-like quality a product of Barks and his assumptions about what Eastern and/or religious poetry should be like, not Rumi? It raises a lot of questions. I feel in the end that I don't know much about the poetry of Rumi, but I like Barks' poetry that was inspired by Rumi (but processed with such a heavy load of American preferences and ways of thinking that it's likely something entirely different from Rumi). The wiki entry indicates that Barks received an honorary doctorate from the U. of Tehran. I'm not even sure what to think of that. Does that mean that they feel his poetry is an accurate representation of Rumi--or sufi thought--or are they simply honoring him for making one of their own more popular in the English-speaking world?I'll be curious to hear if anyone else has a more informed perspective on this."

This is not a game played with lives and loves and delineations of mind and body, a board set with pieces played on the country level for some concept of 'stability' that takes very little to destabilize. This is war.This is an experiment on a grand scale, a love-fest for the more academically inclined, 'interesting material' in the battered bodies and broken souls spit up out of a gigantic machine that has no rhyme or reason. This is the result of masculinity bred on stories of adventure and physical expertise, on shutting up and slimming down the emotions into unfeeling heroics and righteous fury, on boyhood dreams of being 'brave', let loose in comradeship in the face of corpses spit up in your face and death walking the grounds and laughing at your pitiful attempts to cope and spurring you on to love, but not too much. This is the immovable object meeting the oh so movable minds to the point of triumphing over matter, legs that refuse to move, tongues that refuse to speak, screams and cries and shrieks bleeding out of consciences that cannot reason out why and refuse to consider anything but the 'rational explanation'.Tell me, what is rationality? What is sanity? What is the standard of normality you will grade these atrocities on with so much undeniable proof shambling towards you on sewn up sleeves, crawling towards you with so many stories to tell, if they can bear to speak them. If you can bear to listen. If you are capable of sticking to the lines and the rules set down by those before you, no matter how much they stretch and bleed and trap you in nightmares that have no single 'trauma' to explain them. As if humanity can only be broken by a singularity of a specific magnitude of horror, calibrated by those who know nothing of it. Rationality is taking in these fractured relics, these twisted meshes of screams and bones, these tortured playthings of those who have been permitted to control countries, and fixing them. Focusing on the physical, and belittling the mental. Acknowledging the atrocious hypocrisy of the system, and sending those who have suffered the worst of it right back into its jaws. Seeing the similarities between gradations of neuroses on the battlefield and hysterics during peacetime, and doing nothing. Playing god because god help us there is no other recourse left to take that will end in maintenance of our own 'rationality'. Let us have those who make the decisions be the ones who must watch those who die. Let us have those who send them out be the ones who must put them back together. Let us have those who love war be the ones to come to grips with the futility of rational thought. Let us have those who believe that violence in the name of one's country and conceptions of masculinity is just be the ones who must cope when all the rules are shredded by the reality and life is a trap between barbed wire and the endless sea. Let us have those who want it, have it. Have all of it. Every last and horrific part.In today's world, the leading cause of death in active duty U.S. military personnel is suicide. We haven't learned much since in the past century, despite those who have seen the terror before them and the terror behind and have as a last ditch effort left us writing, the truth of the matter. When will we look at these accounts and start to think:
  Nothing can justify this, he'd thought. Nothing nothing nothing.
 Who knows.
  When I’m asleep, dreaming and drowsed and warm,They come, the homeless ones, the noiseless dead.While the dim charging breakers of the stormRumble and drone and bellow overhead,Out of the gloom they gather about my bead.They whisper to my heart; their thoughts are mine.‘Why are you here with all your watches ended?‘From Ypres to Frise we sought you in the line.’In bitter safety I awake, unfriended;And while the dawn begins with slashing rainI think of the Battalion in the mud.‘When are you going back to them again?‘Are they not still your brothers through our blood?’-Siegfried Sassoon, 'Sick Leave'

6263,The Singing Life of Birds: The Art and Science of Listening to Birdsong (with CD),Donald E. Kroodsma,4.25,185,24,Patricia,5,"""As dawn's first light sweeps the globe, so too does a wave of birdsong sweep from east to west, endlessly, day after day, millenium after millenium.""Kroodsma writes about birdsong with a poet's ear and with a scientist's passion for detail and veracity. Or more accurately, his writing actually reveals the deep kinship possible between poetry and science. The level of detail was sometimes hard to follow as I am just learning to distinguish a very few songs Still, though the level of detail is challenging, it is also wondrously revelatory, of the brilliance and complexity of birdsong, of how much there is to learn. I haven't read the whole thing yet. This book is one to grow into, over a long time."
9118,Le Portrait de Dorian Gray,Oscar Wilde,4.06,687442,20028,Stephen,5," Arguably literature's greatest study of shallowness, vanity, casual cruelty and hedonistic selfishness, Wilde lays it down here with ABSOLUTE PERFECTION!! This was my first experience in reading Oscar Wilde and the man’s gift for prose and dialogue is magical. This story read somewhat like a dark, corrupted Jane Austen in that the writing was snappy and pleasant on the ear, but the feeling it left you with was one of hopelessness and despair. The level of cynicism and societal disregard that Wilde’s characters display towards humanity is simply staggering. Despite the dark (or more likely because of it) this is one of the most engaging, compelling and lyrical pieces of literature I have read. The quality of the prose is nothing short masterful. I assume most people know the basic outline of the plot, but I will give you a few sentences on it. The three main characters are Basil Hallward, Lord Henry Wotton and Dorian Gray. Basil Hallward is an artist who after painting a picture of Dorian Gray becomes obsessed with him because of his beauty (the homosexual vs. art object love Basil feels towards Dorian are left vague, likely because of the time it was written). Dorian then meets a friend Basil’s, Lord Henry, and becomes enthralled with Lord Henry’s world view, which is a form of extreme hedonism that posits the only worthwhile life is one spent pursuing beauty and satisfaction for the senses.  The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful.
 Well at one point, Dorian utters the famous words quoted at the beginning of my review and the “Faustian” bargain is struck.While this story is often mentioned among the classics of the Horror genre (which I do have a problem with) this is much more a study of the human monster than it is some boogeyman. My favorite parts of the story were the extensive dialogues between the characters, usually Dorian and Lord Henry. They were wonderfully perverse and display a level of casual cruelty and vileness towards humanity that make it hard to breathe while reading. Oh, and Lord Henry reserves particular offense for the female of the species, to wit: 
  My dear boy, no woman is a genius. Women are a decorative sex. They never have anything to say, but they say it charmingly. Women represent the triumph of matter over mind, just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals.
. 
  YES folks...he absolutely did. One of the most intriguing quotes I have seen from Oscar Wilde regarding this book is his comparison of himself to the three main characters. He said that he wrote the three main characters as reflections of himself. Wilde said, “Basil Hallward is what I think I am: Lord Henry is what the world thinks me: Dorian is what I would like to be—in other ages, perhaps.”I was somewhat floored by this as I found Dorian to be a truly stark representation of evil and could not see how Wilde could find an idealized form within the character. When I say evil, I don't mean just misguided or weak-minded, someone bamboozled by the clever lectures of Lord Henry. I found Gray to be selfish, vain, inhumanly callous and sadistically cruel. I intend to try and learn more about Wilde’s outlook on this character as it truly escapes me.Regardless, this is a towering piece of literature. Beautifully written and filled with memorable characters and a deeply moving story. A novel deserving of its status as a classic of English Literature. 5.0 stars. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!!!P.S. For of audiobooks. I listened to the audio version of this read by Michael Page who has become one of my favorite narrators. His performance here was amazing.

9696,Dogeaters,Jessica Hagedorn,3.59,1849,125,~✡~Dαni(ela) ♥ ♂♂ love & semi-colons~✡~,1,"1.5 starsThe rating on this one kept slipping the more I read. I started with, OK, this might be interesting; moved to, This is totally nonsensical, no more; and culminated in: What the fuckety fuck, I mean, WTF??? WHAT? This book in a nutshell: BIG. HOT. MESS. Sizzling MESS!Like this:Also like this: Rather than write a novel, Hagedorn threw together a series of stories. No, scratch that. These aren't stories. They're vignettes, snatches of lives, bits of memories, crumbs of experience. The problem is that none of it amounts to much, and the chapters certainly don't add up to a book. There are so many characters (lovers Trini and Romeo, Rio who consistently narrates many of the chapters remembering the Philippines of her childhood, bisexual crackhead Joey, the General and his lewd mistress, the rich political couple who seems to be based on Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos, etc.) that we get only glimpses of their lives and can't keep track of the various narratives. There is no actual timeline, no plot. The books seems to take place in the Philippines in the 50s through 80s, but the sense of time is vague at best. While Hagedorn does paint a striking picture of the bureaucracy and madness of her home country, if this is all you'll ever learn about the Philippines, you're bound to think it's home to a bunch of whores, corrupt politicians, and junkies. And considering that my favorite brother-in-law is from the Philippines, I know that's not true!I don't understand the purpose of this book? In her attempt to be original and postmodern, Hagedorn loses all sense of what it means to tell a story and tell it in a way that connects with the audience."
1972,Den of Thieves,James B. Stewart,4.14,8048,166,Tim O'Hearn,3,"A respectable account of the most significant insider trading scandal of all time as well as Michael Milken, the most rapid accumulator of wealth at that time. Den of Thieves is doomed to be remembered as a history book, though. While the author managed to wring every drop of fun out of this story line, which was drawn out beyond any bystander's control, the story often enters dull and tedious stretches. This former New York Times bestseller has been featured on dusty shelfs across the country with bookmarks hanging out somewhere around page 206. Reading this book is kind of like visiting a place for the first time after hearing glowing reviews from your friends. It's new to you, to a degree, and you feel social pressure to remain upbeat and engaged even as you hit snags of disappointment. Den of Thieves is comparable to Barbarians at the Gate in many ways— thickness, setting Guinness World Records for number of names contained in a book, subject matter—but the story is muddled by litigation and can't be placed on the same plane of greatness.Aside from John Mulheren, the entire supporting cast is totally forgettable by the time you make it to the last three chapters. Even Ivan Boesky, who stars prominently early on. Don't get me started on the SEC or the law firms of lawyers, lawyers, and lawyers. Overall, there is way too much zooming in and out for one to keep track of any of the main players.I highly recommend reading Barbarians at the Gate before this book, so you'll have a more thorough background of the subject matter, and saving Fortune's Formula for after, as it reuses some of the most interesting factoids and will cheapen the experience."
1969,"A Tale of Two Cities, Spotlight Edition",Charles Dickens,3.81,684369,13301,Melissa Rudder,5,"My primary goal when I'm teaching A Tale of Two Cities to my sophomores is to make them realize that Charles Dickens didn't write creaky, dusty long novels that teachers embraced as a twisted rite of passage for teenagers. Instead, I want them them to understand why Dickens was one of the most popular writers in England and America during his time. I want them to see the book as the suspenseful, comedic, and sentimental piece of entertainment that it is. Because, while A Tale of Two Cities is masterfully written with sly humor, densely meaningful descriptions, a cast of quirky characters only Dickens could create, an endless series of telling binaries and foils, and relevant social commentary about the French Revolution as well as Dickens' time, it is also simply a damn good story. By a damn good storyteller. I have a difficult time writing reviews about books that I adore because, when I'm not reading them, I hug them too closely to be very critical. (BTW - I frequently hug A Tale of Two Cities in front of my students... and write Charles Dickens' name with hearts around it... They think I'm crazy, but it intrigues some of them just enough to make them doubt the derisive comments of upperclassmen.) I reluctantly admit that Dickens does oversimplify the causes of the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror; however, in doing so, he successfully captures the spirit of a tumultuous period and helps readers sympathize with characters on every side of the developing conflict. I also think that the characters of Roger Cly and John Barsad get a bit messy and may have worked better as a single character. Perhaps the confusion is a result of serialization restructuring. But, really, I read A Tale of Two Cities like a costumed Lord of the Rings fan at a movie premier. I cheer when my favorite characters enter scenes and I knowingly laugh when Dickens cleverly foreshadows future events. Though I don't think that A Tale of Two Cities is Dickens' best novel--that title I would reserve for either Bleak House or David Copperfield--I do agree with Dickens, who claims that it was his best story. It is artfully written. Dickens introduces a cast of characters, sprawled across two nations and spanning varied social classes and political affiliations, and then effortlessly weaves their stories and secrets together in a masterful way. The Modernist movement painstakingly forced literature to reflect the ambiguities and uncertainties of the real world and that's great, but sometimes it is a real joy to read a story that ends with such magnificent closure. All mysteries are solved and everything makes sense. It is beautiful.(I have to admit that I was overjoyed when a group of my fifth period girls persistently voiced their disdain for Dickens' angel in the house Lucie and backed Madame Defarge. I think they may have created a Madame Defarge myspace, actually. Oh how the times have changed.)""Ms. R--, you got me."" ""What?"" ""At the beginning of this book, you said you would get some of us.

7339,The Monsters and the Critics and other essays,J.R.R. Tolkien,3.88,3473,81,Nikki ,4,"Tolkien was a pretty devastatingly smart guy, who didn't only create a world and languages of his own, but was a serious and intelligent scholar who knew many languages, modern and archaic, and had a wide interest in different literatures and mythologies. This volume contains seven of his academic essays: for a modern academic, the volume of his work -- however influential and inspiring -- would be insufficient, with the pressure to publish all the time. Good thing he isn't a contemporary academic: his careful editing and long thought is what made his lectures and essays so accessible.This volume includes two essays on Beowulf: his very famous one, from which the title of this volume derives, and the one he wrote as an introduction to Clark Hall's translation. The first one is, of course, one of the first points of call for anyone studying Beowulf, and rightfully so. The volume also contains an essay on Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, his famous essay 'On Fairy Stories', an essay on 'English and Welsh', an essay about the invention of languages, and his valedictory address, given when he left Oxford. All of them are well worth reading. They're not dry at all, but warm and passionate as Tolkien was warm and passionate, and of course, intelligent. I wish I could have heard him lecture (although, some people who went to his lectures could say that too, given his reputation of being a mumbler)."

7336,J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography,Humphrey Carpenter,4.03,8329,294,Julie Davis,5,"I recently read Humphrey Carpenter's book, The Inklings, for a discussion at A Good Story is Hard to Find podcast and it piqued my interest in his biography of one of my favorite authors. I liked The Inklings but this book was even better, possibly because Carpenter was focusing on one person instead of a group. It gave a thorough story of Tolkien's life without sugar coating his flaws but in a way that allowed me to understand and appreciate him as both a person and author. I'm not usually very interested in biographies but read this in record time, which is a tribute to Carpenter's skill in finding a fascinating story in the outwardly mundane life of an Oxford professor.Of course, like Dr. Who's TARDIS, we're all bigger on the inside and Tolkien's inner landscape held a vast imagination coupled with interest in so many topics that he was sometimes unable to finish a project unless prodded by deadlines or friends. It is Humphrey Carpenter's ability to reconcile Tolkien's inner and outer man, while including his popular fiction in the timeline, that make this book so riveting. We feel we truly know J.R.R. Tolkien by the end.And, this is the ultimate tribute to the author's skill ... as I read the epilogue, I cried."
2150,Pride and Prejudice,Jane Austen,4.24,2223661,49830,Stephen,5,"6.0 stars. Confession...this book gave me an earth-shattering Janeaustegasm and I am feeling a bit spent and vulnerable at the moment, so please bear with me. You see, I decided I wanted to get more literated by reading the ""classicals"" in between my steady flow of science fiction, mystery and horror. The question was where to begin.After sherlocking through my Easton Press collection, I started by pulling out my Dickens and reading A Tale of Two Cities which I thought was jaw-dropping AMAZO and left me feeling warm, satisfied and content. It also made me made retrospectively pleased that I named my youngest daughter Sydney.After Two City “Tale”ing, I decided to give this book a whirl as I kept seeing it on GR lists of ""goodest books ever."" However, I must admit I was hesitant going in to this for two big reasons. One, I thought it might be a bit too romantical for me. The second, and much more distressing, reason was that Twilight was on many of the same lists as this book. Austen fans should pull a nutty over that one.So needless to say I went into this thinking I might hate it. Well, for the 999,987th time in my life (at least according to my wife’s records)...I was wrong!!! I absolutely loved this book and had a mammoth, raging heart-on for it from the opening scene at the breakfast table when Father Witty (Mr. Bennet) is giving sly sarcasm to Mrs. Mommie Put Upon. I literaphorically could not get enough of this story. I was instantly captivated by the characters and Elizabeth Bennet, the main protagonist, immediately became one of my all time favorite characters. Mr. Darcy joined that party as soon as he showed up in the narrative as I thought he was terrific as well.Overall, the writing could not have been better. It was descriptive, lush and brilliant. The story could not have been more engaging or intelligent and the characters could not have been more magnificentastic. Elizabeth and Fitz are both smart, witty, self-confident and good. Austen could not have written them better. Oh, and I am sorry if this is a bit of a minor spoiler but I need to add that George Wickham is a cock-blocking braggadouche of startling proportions. I needed to say that and now I feel better. This one has made it onto my list of All Time Favorite novels and is truly one of the classics that lives up to its billing. A FINAL WORD TO THE GUYS: ...Guys, do not fear the Austen...embrace the Austen...HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!!"
7338,Tolkien on Film: Essays on Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings,Janet Brennan Croft,3.91,35,2,Lisa,4,"Tolkien on Film is a collection of essays on the Peter Jackson films by Tolkien experts. They're not all throwing out the welcome mat for the trilogy (one essay very amusingly states that Jackson has a nine-year old's understanding of LOTR), but the essays cover a great scope of opinions on the films and changes made for adaptation's sake.If you are a fan of the movies that believe they possess no flaws, Peter Jackson can do no wrong and/or that Jackson told the story of the Ring better than those smelly old books by Tolkien, this isn't the book for you. You won't get far before you're throwing it away from you in disgust. But it does really depend on the reader as how they view the films and criticism of the films to how they receive the book.Personally, I found all but a couple of essays very interesting, even if I didn't entirely agree with some of the arguments made or the opinions expressed. Some were even quite entertaining. I also enjoyed that neither one of the two essays on Tolkien fanfiction never explored the question of fandom and fanfiction in negative terms. I very much hope that there will be a second volume, focusing on Jackson's Hobbit trilogy."

من انك ستجد تحامل شديد في المسلسل علي كل الرؤساء وانظمة الحكم علي انها السبب في مايحدث في حياه ذات -بالاخص مشهد الحلم الذي اجتمع فيه الثالوث الرئاسي المصري- الا ان هذا لا ينكر ان المسلسل قدم بشكل واضح ان الناس نفسهم هم من يفسدون حياتهم بايديهم -كامتناع اهل العماره عن الالتزام بقواعد النظافة مثلا- فسلوك قلة من الناس تكبر ككرة ثلج لتشمل المجتمع كلهالعمل الفني باداء تمثيلي لكل الابطال اكثر من رائع

من الفلاش باك باسهاب يربك الي حد كبير التسلسل الزمني -إن وجد- لسير الاحداث وإن كنت اري في هذا الجزء الاخير رمزيه جيده -بالتاكيد مقصوده وان كان بعض اجزاءها مبهم لي- بين ثالوث خادمات بيت ذات وثالوث خدم مصرالاسلوب الساخر راق لي كثيرا جدا وهو افضل ما في الروايه,التقطيع في الاحداث -وليس تقطيع التسلسل- اعجبني جدا في الكثير من المواقف التي يربطها احيانا بشكل غير متوقع وعوامل طريفه وطرق وصف ابداعيه للاشخاص والمواقف ولكنها للاسف تنتهي احيانا اخري بالبتر الغير مبرر ولكني لازلت معجب بطرق الوصف فعلا والاسلوب -بوجهه عام-الساخركما اعجبني جدا فكره ""البث وماكينات البث"" واري فيه واقعيه محببهفنحن المصريون فعلا نعشق البث في كل المجالات وفي اي الاوقات..لا يوجد لدينا مصطلح -الصمت المريح- فكل الصمت لدينا صمت غير مريح ويدل علي عدم الراحه والانسجام بين الجالسين...البث هو مايوصل بينناولكن الفاظ المؤلف في بثه الروائي حتي وان كانت واقعيه فلم تعجبني تماما فانا اري ان لابد من وضع فرق بين الواقعيه والبذائه فلا معني وجود تلك الالفاظ في حياتنا ان تنتشر بهذه الطريقه في الرواياتلا عجب من الاعجاب المتبادل بين صنع الله ابراهيم و احمد مراد فالاثنان يستخدمان نفس اسلوب البث المطعم بالالفاظ البذئيهكما اشرت في ريفيو تراب الماسلم يعجبني ايضا -ربما لاني احببت ذات المسلسل-ذات الروايه..فهي مغلوبه -اكثر واكثر- علي امرها...غبيه الي حد ما ..ليست فطنه او لم يظهر تدبيرها كما اظهرته مريم نعوم بالمسلسلفلقد رأيت سيدات بيوت مثل ذات ""المسلسل"" كثيرا جدا ولكن ذات الروايه كانت ليست كالمصريات في تدبيرها..حتي

اجهله-والذي به بعض المقاطع الطريفه وايضا لان الروايه تحتوي علي نوع اخر غير البث الروائي ,نوع ليس بجديد ولكن الجديد هو حجم هذا النوع الذي صار فصلا كاملا يلحق بكل فصل من البث الروائي حتي صار قريبا جدا من نصف الروايه نفسهاهذا النوع من البث هو****""الــبث الاخبـاري/الارشـيـفي""******وهو مايعبر عنه بجداره الغلاف الخلفي للروايه -حسنه احمد مراد بعد سيئات الغلاف الامامي- ..فانا اتوقع ان فنجان القهوه

347,Off the Main Sequence: The Other Science Fiction Stories of Robert A. Heinlein,Robert A. Heinlein,4.04,211,14,Muath Aziz,3,"Universe: My favorite so far; so mythical, so thrilling, so philosophical, so beautiful and true! What's happening among them, not being able to correctly interpret Jordan Plan, needing to resort to nonsense metaphysical interpretation of it! This reminds me so much of Hobbes and his Materialist interpretation of the Bible. Also, Hugh going out to the no-weight zone, learning the truth, descending back to his fellows, informing them with the truth, they're blinded: Heresy! Prosecute him! This is so Plato's Cave, which is also parallel to the prosecution of Socrates.-----Elsewhen: Berkeleian Idealism, where you control the time/existence.""But you engineers are as bad as metaphysicians -you ignore any fact that you can't weigh in scales. If you can't bite it, it's not real. You believe in a mechanistic, deterministic universe, and ignore the facts of human consciousness, human will, and human freedom of choice- facts that you have directly experienced""""When you die, you won't die all over, no matter how intensely you may claim to expect to. It is an emotional impossibility for any man to believe in his own death""Damn man, this is the trippiest thing I've ever read! I wonder how high in weed and mushrooms Heinlein was when who wrote this. And cut the subconscious crap, the professor clearly gave his students a joint hahaha. The awesome thing is that they can get inside each other's trip! Oh good old hippies.-----By His Bootstraps: Time Travel, Philosophy.I think I watched enough TT movies to know all the twists, all three persons in the room where the same person (the protagonist), the bearded man with the TT machine was also the protagonist. Closed loops of Cause and Effect common in TT stories. The protagonist writing a failed Physic paper but then magically finding a schematics for a TT machine that leads him to make and travel to the future only later when he get older he sends back the same schematics to his younger self (this wasn't exactly what happened here but you see the similarities).Tho I founded it very cliché and fought to finish it in 2015, I'm sure it was quite avant garde when he wrote at the time. The last 20 pages I was planing to skip but eventually didn't, were so enchanting and saved the day!Also there is the usual ""f#%k you scientists with all your entropies and cause and effect nonsense!"" talk common in other stories of the author.-----Lost Legacy: Superpowers.This reminds me of the movie Lucy, ""release the hidden powers within your brain!"". I like how he connected it with lumps of the brain that we don't know the use of, medically. Choosing main characters of a sergeant, a psychologist, a lady, got the story going. The doctor stands for skeptic-in-metaphysics scientist, the psychologist is one that believes in the subconscious powers etc, the girl, well he always put a girl that the other main characters romanticize (check ""Let there me light"").I like how Religion is involved here! The characters, explicitly for no reason (destiny?), climbed up a mountain only to get caught in a storm then some guy rescue them. They discover a community with superpowers up there (x-men school?). Jesus, Buddha, all climbed up mountains. Men had these powers before The Deluge but shortly before the event some grouped started a war and Atlantis sank (The Deluge) and Humanity forgot the superpowers but for small groups live hidden.. Jesus had superpowers!-----Goldfish Bowl: Aliens? Mythical elements (Water/fish, Mud/man, Air/super-intelligence, Fire?/under-the-crust-creatures)It start hard to read and hideous narration then it gets better, when he wakes up in nowhere and naked.""He awoke refreshed, but quite hungry and extremely thirsty. The matter of dead, mor not-dead, no longer concerned him; he was interested in neither theology nor metaphysics. He was hungry.""He got all poetic, he was trapped by a superior race (Martians, it was obvious from the beginning like many other twists in other stories) and helpless, just like when he trapped his goldfish in the bowl, hence Goldfish Bowl. (It reminds me of Attack on Titans where titans suddenly attacked people and ate them, just like when people attacked sheep and cows!)Aaaaand there is the usual (skeptic scientist: nonsense! This weird bizarre phenomenon can be easily explained by hypothesis!).. Really? O dear Robert, really? Even scientists need luv ya know..-----Pied Piper: PacifistI like how the author have two general themes, Metaphysical Philosophy (Absolute Idealism?) and Politics (Pacifist, Juvenile), such a hippie lol.""Men are willing to be killed in war for one reason only -that their tribe may live after them. That is to say, they fight for their children. To a nation without children, war is meaningless, not worth fighting. That is a primary datum of mass psychology!""""Go on.""""I propose that we kidnap their children!""So, music saved the world! -----Free Men: Post-Nuclear-WarMeh. No SF or any stuff, just that America was bombed, the government fell, a group is fighting to get their freedom back unlike some americans. This reminds me of France during WW2 with guerrillas up on the mountains against the Vichy.-----Jerry Was a Man: Genetically-Modified AnimalsSF where horses can be modified to fly and elephants read and write. It's human; animals too have feelings!-----Water is fro Washing: Natural DisasterI like how epic this is. It's unique, no Politics, no SF, Metaphysics. But the disaster was expected; the bartender expected it explicitly. This is common with the author; he ain't that good in planting seeds or delivering twists and punches but he sure have a brilliant Imagination!-----Nothing Ever Happens on the Moon: Moon exploration.I like how this collection is ordered chronologically (of writing not publishing) so it shows how the author style of writing is changing by time. This one is way more realistic than earlier writings, no Politics and no Metaphysics. And truly, nothing ever happens in the moon.-----Gulf: Thriller, Action, super weapon, supermen (very intelligent ones).So Superman is going to save man from himself? I smell the usual hippie pacifist politics of the author hehe. One of the characters destroyed the dangerous film and saved humanity.And this mysterious film of Nova Effect weapon reminds me of the mysterious box in the movie Kiss Me Deadly.""The gulf between us and them is narrow, but it is very deep. We cannot close it.""Oh and there is the usual ""oh you're pretty, let's get married!"" But this time a girl is telling the protagonist not the other way around.548-552 has some good fiction linguistics that I may return to later.The beginning and end is thrilly, the middle part when he het his fellow x-men they taught him how to unleash all of his brain's power not just the 20% just like in Lost Legacy, middle part was lame at least Speedtalk was fun.There were some small details of Alternative History but is was negligible, had nothing to do with the story.And it ended with them marrying but both dying trying to save the world. And how did the evil old woman make the superweapon? It suddenly happened! Okay there was a good seed, when he first met his fellow supermen he told them they must train them to kill her, also there were some news of her moving to the moon to retire, only to find that she moved there so she can blast Earth with the superweapon without dying since she is on the moon! But still, very weak writing..Still, I really like this along with Universe (my favorite so far) and maybe Elsewhen.-----Destination Moon: Trip to the moon, Thriller.This reminds me so much of the movie Apollo 13, keeping in mind that the author wrote this as a screen play from a movie with the same name.It's really nice, nothing special but well written story. There are aliens living on the dark side of the Moon (just like that in Gulf there was mass always behind the Sun that we can't see from Earth thus is was blasted while testing the superweapon), however they had nothing to do with the story.-----The Year of The Jackpot: Statistical Apocalypse.How cool is that! So events happen in cycles (war, love, death, natural disasters, etc) and a statistics mathematician predicted that after few days all the cycles will peak at the same time (year of the jackpot!), Los Angeles was nuked, WW3 happened so fast, 40 major cities blasted in a blink (he mentioned something like this before in another story; the 40 mins War, or something).I like the Cause-Effect talk. He has the we-shouldn't-how-it-happens cuz it just happens, this is similar to Data Mining (Computer Science) where we have very big data that we don't need to do the root-cause analysis required by Statistics, meaning Correlation is good enough!I like the ""3 million free-wills go to the center of New York every morning, 3 million free-wills go back home at the end of day"". Meaning by statistics (big number of individuals not specifically an individual) we act as if we don't really have a free-will.Also there is the regular ""hey gurl you're pretty, let's get married!"".In general I like the narration of this story along with the ideas in it.-----Project Mightmare: yet another ESP story, Thriller, Cold War?It just so happens that people with ESP abilites were gathered in a military base demonestrating that they can set off A-bombs just when Russia threatened USA in the middle of the demonestration that they implanted 42 bombs cross big cities in America. They used ESPers to blackout the bombs and help the police in finding them. The beginning was bad but it gets better, when ESPers got so tired that when one of them fainted, the city he was searching for the the bomb in it exploded!I like that when something strange delivered to the reader (ESP/psychic powers in this story) the author exceeds that and delivers something even strange to the characters in the story ""they can set off bombs, but can they defuse them? No one tried that before!""The pacifist ending tho:USA President: ""could you set off those Russian bombs while they are still far away?""She got a far-away look. ""Dorothy and I had better have a quite room somewhere. And I'd like a pot of tea. A large pot.""-----Sky Lift: SF, Fast Traveling.I like the narration of this story! I felt what the protaginst felt! My mind was filled with scientific questions! Is it really ""the time advantage dropped by inverse squares. 18 days requires 1g, so 9 days took 4g"", really?I like that they are talking about how much accerelation not speed! Of course they shouldn't feel the trip took 9 days when they are at 4g, going so fast means the time you feel is less compared to stationed observers! Check Almost-speed-of-light Twin paradox.And why is it always that the protagonist named Joe?-------- A Tenderfoot in Space: Life in Venus.I love this! The narration is so good. He's narrating about a dog, I liked this more than Kafka on Shore's cats. I would recommend this story for reading. He is here saying ""respect our long gone scientists even tho they were ignorant at some stuff, if it wasn't for them we wouldn't be here!"", no more ""f%$k scientists"" lol.--------All You Zombies: TT, paradoxes.The transexuallity is discussed as usual. This is very similar to By His Bootstraps, cliche TT wher five characters is the same person.This is not just the grandfather's paradox, here a girl sleeps with a guy then gets pregnant then changs her sex only to get older as a man to seduce an orphan girl (himseld before surgery) so this orphan girl gets pregnant then her baby is stolen, this baby is taken back in time (by a very old him/her) so the baby grows up as an orphan to be seduced by himsif.As usual the name of the story is a quote from it: The Snake That Eats Its Own Tail, Forever and Ever ... I know where I came from - but where did all you zombies come from?-----I know this is his collection of ""not so good"" stories but still some of them are really good. I would recommend Universe/Common Sense, Elsewhen, Gulf, A Tenderfoot in Space. Also: They, Goldfish Bowl, The Year of The Jackpot."

3199,Gorgias,Plato,3.92,6711,200,Riku Sayuj,5,"A Starker DialogueGorgias is very similar in structure, content, focus and argument with the Republic. In fact, it comes across almost a half-formed version of it, and scholars argue that it is in many ways like an early sketch for Republic. But unlike the Republic, which forays into metaphysics and utopias, the argument in Gorgias is anchored very much in this world, and, again in contrast to Republic where everyone seems persuaded in the end, Gorgias leaves us in the dark as to whether Socrates has really persuaded his audience of what he values most.Another significant difference with Republic is the absence of a narrator. Commentators argue that that the stark, uncompromising ‘frame’ this forces on the dialogue suggests that this absence of narrator may be an important factor in Plato's design; he may wish to avoid the softening effect of narrative mediation in dramatizing Socrates' lack of success in creating empathy with his interlocutors, his inability to teach them about goodness and justice, which, ironically enough, seems in danger of putting him in the same camp as all the failed statesmen he criticizes.Gorgias concludes awkwardly and abruptly, almost painfully aware of the deficiencies in the method employed; and we just have Socrates' last words (527e): 'let us follow that way [practicing righteousness and virtue] and urge others to follow it, instead of the way which you in mistaken confidence are urging upon me; for that way is worthless, Callicles.' What has Callicles (or the others, for that matter) to say in reply to the myth and the long argument that conclude the dialogue? We are not informed. The dialogue trails off inconclusively like one of the ‘aporetics’.Another marked parallel with Republic is how Gorgias too concludes with an eschatological myth, affirming the soul’s survival after our death and its punishment or reward in the afterlife for a life lived unjustly or the reverse.Just like in Republic, the trial and the execution is hinted at… but in Gorgias, they loom large and threatening, Plato callously converting hindsight into foresight and charging Socrates’ sentences with prophetic doom and an early condemnation of the system that precipitates his own death in the near future. Socrates is made to relive a prophetic version of the trial and speaks as though it was all but inevitable in such a corrupt system that a man like him has an ending like that. It remind’s one of Jesus’s early (or similarly hindsight-foresight inversion) exhortations to his disciples about how the cross was waiting at the end of the road.A Deeper GlanceEvent though Gorgias is an earlier work (allegedly) and is sketchy in comparison to republic, it also allows us a closer look at one aspect of Plato’s concern: on Oratory. The method employed to condemn Oratory, by using the distinction between ‘art’ and ‘knack’ gives important clues on why Plato goes on to condemn all of Poetry in Republic. The reason, I feel, is that Poetry, like Oratory was a public art in Plato’s time - both intended to pursued without ‘true knowledge’. Hence the same method when extended to Poetry would allow Plato to conclude that Poetry and storytelling too are ‘knacks’ developed from experience and hence less than the ‘genuine arts’.Here is a dose of the brilliant exposition: Pastry baking has put on the mask of medicine, and pretends to know the foods that are best for the body, so that if a pastry baker and a doctor had to compete in front of children, or in front of men just as foolish as children, to determine which of the two, the doctor or the pastry baker, had expert knowledge of good food and bad, the doctor would die of starvation. I call this flattery, and I say that such a thing is shameful, Polus—it’s you I’m saying this to—because it guesses at what’s pleasant with no consideration for what’s best. And I say that it isn’t a craft, but a knack, because it has no account of the nature of whatever things it applies by which it applies them, so that it’s unable to state the cause of each thing. And I refuse to call anything that lacks such an account a craft. If you have any quarrel with these claims, I’m willing to submit them for discussion.So pastry baking, as I say, is the flattery that wears the mask of medicine. Cosmetics is the one that wears that of gymnastics in the same way; a mischievous, deceptive, disgraceful and ill-bred thing, one that perpetrates deception by means of shaping and coloring, smoothing out and dressing up, so as to make people assume an alien beauty and neglect their own, which comes through gymnastics. So that I won’t make a long-style speech, I’m willing to put it to you the way the geometers do—for perhaps you follow me now—that what cosmetics is to gymnastics, pastry baking is to medicine; or rather, like this: what cosmetics is to gymnastics, sophistry is to legislation, and what pastry baking is to medicine, oratory is to justice.While this (the argument-from-analogy with Doctors is a favorite of Socrates) may be true to an extent, Plato does not give consideration to the possibility that the story-tellers (or, substitute Chefs/Docs, if you really want to!) might actually have a greater understanding than the philosophers about the mysterious workings of the human soul. It is blasphemy to conclude on this note but it is an exciting thread to pursue further in the reading of Plato.A Note on the TranslationThis translation gets the right mix of ponderous phrasing, elegance and readability - conveying the ancient mystique and the modern relevance. Also, it is broken up well into small parts, each with an introductory passage always initiating the reader into what is about to transpire in the dialogue. This might be irritating to the seasoned reader but is a pleasant respite for the novice and functions like the small interludes that Plato himself likes to inject into his dialogues.It is also true that this acts like a spoiler and takes away from the thrill of the argument being developed by Socrates. I personally started coming back to the introductory passage after reading the actual text so as to reinforce instead of foreshadow the argument. I would advice the same course for future readers as well.DisclaimerAs is evident from the review itself, this reviewer is still too much under the influence of Republic and this reading was conducted almost entirely in its shadow. Hence, the review is a biased and incomplete one that does no justice to Gorgias. Gorgias is a complex and lengthy dialogue that deserves independent study and cannot be treated as a mere appendix to Republic as this review may seem to suggest. That was not the intent.This reviewer found the parallels and contrasts with Republic very fascinating and spent most time debating that, but the ideas expressed in Gorgias are as stunning and intellectually engaging and forays into territory left unexplored in Republic. The elaboration on techne might just be one of the centerpieces of Platonic thought. Gorgias is a must read among the ‘later Early period’ dialogues of Plato - an important step towards the 'middle-period' dialogues such as Meno, almost a point of transition. In fact, Gorgias is necessary reading for any serious reader of Republic. No excuses.Postscript: I would love a T-shirt like that. Anybody?"

2342,Power of One,Bryce Courtenay,4.34,61556,4627,Elyse,5,"Wow... incredible!!! I fell in love with Peekay even 'before' he was five years old, starting in South Africa, when he shares of being nursed from his lovely black nanny before being sent to boarding school. ( although we follow him from age 5 to 20 - from the late 1930's to mid 40's).Our oldest daughter attended a boarding High School in Michigan for a short time -an academic/arts school. The family separation was painful. I can't begin to imagine sending a 5 year old away to a boarding school even in the 'best' of conditions.And the fact that this story is inspired by the authors real life....for me, this is one of the most wrenching parts of the entire book....""being sent away from his family at age 5 -- from 'love' he was receiving to 'hatred' he was walking into. Peekay is bullied and abused almost immediately upon arrival as a 5 year old at his boarding school. He's the youngest child in the school. Missing the comfort of his Black nanny ( Peekay is English and white), who would soothe his hurts...missing his mother who was sent away due to a nervous breakdown, Peekay was the first live example of the congenital hate they carried for his kind.  ""The Boer War had created great malevolent feelings against the English, who were called the 'rooineks'. It was a hate that had entered the Afrikaner bloodstream and pocked the hearts and minds of the next generation"". Given that Peekay, spoke English, he pronounced sentences that killed their grandfathers and grandmothers to the world's first concentration camps. Little Peekay had no advance warning that he was wicked before coming to the school. One of the other kids - called 'Judge' abused Peekey regularly. Peekay even made a deal with him to do the Judge's homework and make sure he didn't fail-- but he still continues to abuse him. - really 'tortured him.  We see how Peekay begins to survive- horrific conditions at such a young tender age: Peekay says: ""One thing got to them more than anything else. They could make me cry. Even the Judge, with all of the fear he could provoke, could not make me cry. I suspect they even began to admire me a bit. Many as them brothers my age at home, and they knew how easy it is for a five-year-old to cry. In fact, I had turned six but nobody had told me, so in my head, I was still five"".  ""Not being able to cry was the hardest part for me as well. Crying can't be a good camouflage. In truth, my willpower had very little to do with my resolve never to cry. I had learned a special trick and, in the process, had somehow lost the knack of turning on the tap"". Peekay is a diamond in the rough....an inspiring character. He's smart, open minded, and doesn't have an ounce of bitterness or hatred in him. He develops meaningful friendships with teachers and mentors who teach him to read. He meets a healer, and a boxer. We learn a tremendous amount about boxing. We also learn a lot about the history of South Africa through the eyes of a child. The themes of discrimination were well defined by the author: the Boers vs. the English - South Africans vs. the Germans - the Jews vs. the Germans - white Africans vs. the Black Africans. Violence is graphic - so be warned. It's a cruel and beautiful world we live in! "
1907,Inventing the Flat Earth: Columbus and Modern Historians,Jeffrey Burton Russell,4.15,74,11,Karen,5,"In this work Russell challenged the (false) myth that one important facet of Columbus' voyage was that it proved the world was round not flat. Perturbed by the myth's stay power, Russell amassed a mountain of sources from antiquity through Columbus' day (including his own journals) which clearly demonstrate otherwise. Russell then backtracked through textbooks and other popular historical sources to find the origination of the Flat Earth myth, and analyzed when it was invented and why it was able to gain such a foothold in popular culture and history, including in scholarly works. He determines that among the greatest offenders for this myth's preservation lie with the humanists and the protestants in the post reformation era when it was popular to blame and label Catholicism as the mechanism by which scientific knowledge had been stunted during the middle ages. Russell is adamant that among the educated during the Middle Ages, there was no question that the earth was round. He follows this line of thought through to the later 1800s and the emergence of Evolution, where he asserted that an artificial and unnecessary argument arose, where it had never previously existed, between religion and science. Perhaps most interestingly, Russell pointed out that Medieval scientists did not attempt to support their scientific theories with biblical proof and that this phenomenon is a fairly recent development among the fundamentalist sects of Christianity who continue to emphasize the split between science and religion as irreconcilable epistemes.An incredibly insightful and succinctly written work, its 77 pgs are jam packed with information and every word is crucial. Russell seemed to strive to avoid academic bloviating so common in academic texts and with the exception of his final summation (which was needed) there is no repetition in this work. Monolinguists will appreciate Russell's thoughtful translations of various titles, quotes, and passages in his footnotes. His work serves as reminder for scholars in all disciplines to check their primary sources and not to take secondary sources at their word, even if well established. Ultimately, Russell's work serves to remind us that ""every worldview is a human construct and that paradigms of knowledge are precarious and subject to change..."" (pg., 75)"
5802,A Visit to Vanity Fair: Moral Essays on the Present Age,Alan Jacobs,3.82,68,14,Chris Griffith,5,"In A Visit to Vanity Fair: Moral Essays on the Present Age, Alan Jacobs tackles themes big and diminutive in this somewhat wildly eclectic collection. Jacobs is an English professor at Wheaton College and his love of the language and it's impact upon our culture shines.Although, only a tiny bit disjointed (it is an eclectic collection after all!), each essay flows with charity and humility from one subject to the next. Jacobs finds a lot to talk about in such a short book! From the possibility of--along with the pros and cons of ebooks (this book was written in 2001 prior to the creation of the Amazon Kindle) to the virtues of Harry Potter and the proper use of magic...er, I mean technology, Professor Jacobs uses his keen eye of the world and quick wit to engage creatively with moral questions and offers a cultural critique of the 21st Century from a Christian perspective. I especially appreciated his discussion of Bob Dylan and his classic record Blood on the Tracks.Jacobs is obviously a fan of C.S. Lewis and W.H. Auden as those two writers are prominently quoted and referred to in almost every chapter.Apparently, Jacobs has put together several collections of essays. He's obviously a gifted man when it comes to observation. In an attempt at a bit of self-deprecating humor in the essay on the ""Lives of Essayists,"" Jacobs suggests that ""if an essay is anything, it is the discourse of an inexpert."" However, I would suggest Alan Jacobs is one of those sorts of writers who could write about virtually anything and transform it into something appealing by virtue of his insight and articulation! In my opinion Jacobs is one of the finest American writers out there and I'm looking forward to reading more books by him soon....stay tuned!"
3461,Dear John,Nicholas Sparks,4.01,459200,10693,Arlene,4,"Dear John by Nicholas Sparks is one of those books I've developed a love/hate relationship with. I love, love, love the first part of the book, and I immediately fell for the main character, John Tyree. But when he gets his Dear John letter, it was all down hill from there, and I have to say I was left in angst. The ending is to some extent depressing, but I do have to give it to Sparks because he paints a realistic picture. However, someone needs to let the man know that he's writing fiction and sometimes, it's okay to have a happily ever after. His readers would surely appreciate it.About the book… John Tyree's life is spiraling down hill when he decides to join the army. During a leave, he comes home and meets Savannah, and that's when his life takes a turn. They fall in love, and because of her, he learns how to forge a relationship with his father. He returns to his base in Germany with the hopes of coming home to Savannah when his tour is over. Then 9/11 hits, and he makes a choice that will change his life forever.Great story, with a realistic yet off-of-the-charts sad ending. Let's just say, I'll proceed with caution when choosing another Sparks book in the future."
3462,The Rescue,Nicholas Sparks,4.1,149547,3312,Aj the Ravenous Reader,4,"I used to see Mr. Nicholas Sparks as a guy who kills off his characters for sport. Like every time he writes a new story, I picture him rubbing the palm of his hands against each other while madly grinning and asking “Who I am going to kill this time? *insert evil laugh here*”  Only after reading this particular novel of his did I learn how wrong I was. I learned that most of his stories’ premises are based from his real life experiences or about members of his family and I believe it takes true courage to share to the world something so painful and so personal. I admit I was on full detective mode from page one already guessing which of the wonderful, perfectly kind characters will potentially die but despite that, the story touched my heart unexpectedly. It mostly has to do with the main theme of the story: a parent’s unconditional love for his/her child. It also helps a lot that there’s a cute four year old boy. They get me all the time-cute little kids in stories.^^Just to be clear, Mr. Sparks’ standard formulaic ingredients are still there:✽ Small town setting✽ A simply beautiful female character who turns every man’s head in said small town✽ An attractive male character who wears masculine work boots✽ Tragic tone✽ Slow start✽ More than necessary writing details✽ *Ahem* A love scene or two (or more)✽ At least one death✽ Heart-wrenching scenes/dialogues that’ll make you spill tears. (At least I found the perfect excuse to spill tears I have been trying to hold back since my wisdom tooth started growing)BUT, I particularly adore the portrayal of the female character, Denise. Her strength as a woman and as a mother is just admirable. I’m sure every girl could pick up a thing or two from her. The conclusion is far more hopeful and lighter than I expected and if I would recommend anything from the author, I think this would be it.^^"
5800,Vanity Fair,William Makepeace Thackeray,3.76,99117,2663,"Captain Sir Roddy, R.N. (Ret.)",5,"Here I am, 54 years old, and for the very first time reading William Makepeace Thackeray's Vanity Fair. ""Vanity Fair: A Novel without a Hero."" I disagree with Thackeray. The 'Hero' of Vanity Fair is the steadfast and stalwart William Dobbin; of that there is no doubt. This novel is not the coming of age, or bildungsroman, of Becky Sharp. No, Miss Rebecca Sharp sprang from the womb enlivened with her desire to claw her way to the top. She can't help it, and nor should she; is she really any different than any of us? No, she's not. It is her methods that vary from what you and I might use; or do they?To me, the narrator's voice in the novel was most amazing. It seemed that at every opportune moment, the narrator took a step back and informed us, the reader, of some nugget, some little moral, that placed the actions of the participants in the Fair in context. Vanity Fair is with us, all around us; and many times we never fully understand the roles that the players play. This voice of reason grounds us; makes us understand the joy, the pain, the happiness, and the sorrow that accompanies each of us in our journey through life. If we care to, we can learn to become better parents, better husbands, better wives, and better friends.I also learned through the course of the novel that I can't outright condemn Becky Sharp. Becky is perhaps not a woman easily liked, but she is an admirable woman, a tough woman, and a woman I can respect. Strong-minded and willed, a terrible mother, but a battle-axe to those who take her head-on. Miss Becky Sharp -- Mrs. Rawdon Crawley -- is committed to living life at its fullest, and not one jot less. She is a woman of purpose, and that is a rare quality in many people.The novel drips with satire from page to page; it is full of wit and sardonic humor. It is through the use of satire that we realize that the characters at the Fair are us -- have been us, and always will be us -- generation after generation, and nothing will change; only the time will change. There will always be Lord Steynes, Jos Sedleys, Old Osbornes, Mother Sedleys, Sir Pitt Crawleys, Miss Crawleys, the George Osbornes, William Dobbins, and Amelias. Our task, according to Thackeray, is to figure out how best to treat them, how best to interact and understand them, how to live with them. The real challenge, however, is how best to love, appreciate, and care for the Miss Becky Sharps in our lives. We do deserve to know her, to care for her, to appreciate her for whom she is, and she deserves to be brought in from the rambunctiousness and vagaries of the Fair.In the end, it is Miss Sharp that gains at least some measure of redemption. It is she, and she alone, that removes the mote from Amelia's eyes regarding her feelings for William Dobbin. For Becky Sharp does understand honor, virtue, and integrity (or, does she?).

5801,Vanity Fair,William Makepeace Thackeray,3.76,99117,2663,"Captain Sir Roddy, R.N. (Ret.)",5,"Here I am, 54 years old, and for the very first time reading William Makepeace Thackeray's Vanity Fair. ""Vanity Fair: A Novel without a Hero."" I disagree with Thackeray. The 'Hero' of Vanity Fair is the steadfast and stalwart William Dobbin; of that there is no doubt. This novel is not the coming of age, or bildungsroman, of Becky Sharp. No, Miss Rebecca Sharp sprang from the womb enlivened with her desire to claw her way to the top. She can't help it, and nor should she; is she really any different than any of us? No, she's not. It is her methods that vary from what you and I might use; or do they?To me, the narrator's voice in the novel was most amazing. It seemed that at every opportune moment, the narrator took a step back and informed us, the reader, of some nugget, some little moral, that placed the actions of the participants in the Fair in context. Vanity Fair is with us, all around us; and many times we never fully understand the roles that the players play. This voice of reason grounds us; makes us understand the joy, the pain, the happiness, and the sorrow that accompanies each of us in our journey through life. If we care to, we can learn to become better parents, better husbands, better wives, and better friends.I also learned through the course of the novel that I can't outright condemn Becky Sharp. Becky is perhaps not a woman easily liked, but she is an admirable woman, a tough woman, and a woman I can respect. Strong-minded and willed, a terrible mother, but a battle-axe to those who take her head-on. Miss Becky Sharp -- Mrs. Rawdon Crawley -- is committed to living life at its fullest, and not one jot less. She is a woman of purpose, and that is a rare quality in many people.The novel drips with satire from page to page; it is full of wit and sardonic humor. It is through the use of satire that we realize that the characters at the Fair are us -- have been us, and always will be us -- generation after generation, and nothing will change; only the time will change. There will always be Lord Steynes, Jos Sedleys, Old Osbornes, Mother Sedleys, Sir Pitt Crawleys, Miss Crawleys, the George Osbornes, William Dobbins, and Amelias. Our task, according to Thackeray, is to figure out how best to treat them, how best to interact and understand them, how to live with them. The real challenge, however, is how best to love, appreciate, and care for the Miss Becky Sharps in our lives. We do deserve to know her, to care for her, to appreciate her for whom she is, and she deserves to be brought in from the rambunctiousness and vagaries of the Fair.In the end, it is Miss Sharp that gains at least some measure of redemption. It is she, and she alone, that removes the mote from Amelia's eyes regarding her feelings for William Dobbin. For Becky Sharp does understand honor, virtue, and integrity (or, does she?). Thackeray finishes appropriately -- For truly it can be said, ""Vanitas Vanitatum! Which of us is happy in this world? Which of us has his desire? or, having it, is satisfied? -- Come, children, let us shut up the box and the puppets, for our play is played out.""A magnificent novel from start to finish."
3464,"True Believer (Jeremy Marsh & Lexie Darnell, #1)",Nicholas Sparks,3.8,68109,2624,Carol [Goodreads Addict],4,"True Believer is book one in the two book series, Jeremy Marsh & Lexie Darnell, by Nicholas Sparks.Jeremy Marsh is thirty seven years old and is an investigative journalist. He is known for his scientific debunking abilities, such as outing a psychic as a fraud who claims to be able to speak to the dead. Jeremy lives in New York and is divorced. He was badly hurt in the process. It’s been several years. He is very good looking and has no problem with women, just hasn’t allowed himself to go beyond casual encounters. Jeremy received a letter in the mail from a woman named Doris from Boone Creek, North Carolina, inviting him to come to their tiny town to investigate some ghostly lights that appear in the town cemetery. He already has prime time television interested in him in the wake of his last story, so this one has the possibility of launching his career from journalism into television. He can’t refuse. So off Jeremy goes, from the metropolitan city of New York, to a tiny town, dying little by little, grasping at straws to stay alive. Jeremy always solves his mysteries. Doris, the woman who wrote the letter, even claims to have some psychic abilities. But when Doris sends Jeremy to the town library to begin his research on the town’s history, he meets Doris’s granddaughter, the librarian, Lexie Darnell, and his life was forever changed. “You don’t believe in magic of any kind?”“No,” he said.“That’s sad,” she said. “Because sometimes it’s real.”Lexie loved living in Boone Creek. She loved being near her grandmother who raised her after her own parents tragically died. She loved her job as librarian. And she loved the people of the town. She did leave Boone Creek for college and even fell in love. But she was badly hurt and returned to Boone Creek, just as she always knew she someday would. She didn’t want to feel an attraction to Jeremy. She had known men like him, big city men, who looked down on small towns like this one. And if she did allow herself to care, it would be she that would end up getting hurt. Because her life was here and his was in New York. Still, there was something about him, and it was too much to ignore.For Jeremy, Lexie was different than any other woman he had ever known. She challenged him in ways no one else ever had. Her humor was dry and sarcastic. She was intelligent and witty and sweet and honest to a fault. He had trouble keeping his mind on what he was supposed to be doing. His thoughts always seemed to drift to her. Could a man fall in love in just two days? Because he just can’t imagine his life without her in it. Is there a way to make things work? Over his time in Boone Creek, Jeremy immersed himself in the town history and studied the cemetery and the surrounding areas. The mayor of the town treated Jeremy like a celebrity and Jeremy found himself impressed with the town and it’s people. And finally, Jeremy got to see the lights. They were beautiful. It was an experience he’ll never forget. Are they really the spirits of the long ago deceased or is there a logical explanation?This is a beautifully told love story between two people that were both okay being alone, who weren’t looking for anything more than what they had. But isn’t that when love usually finds you? When you aren’t looking for it? This is actually a pretty long book. And I have to admit it was a little slow at times. In true Nicholas Sparks fashion, he builds the story slowly, allowing us to get to know the characters. I also admit that Lexie frustrated me a bit. But it was only because she was trying to protect herself, and her town. I loved Jeremy. For a man who spent his life proving that magic wasn’t real, I loved how easily he accepted how he felt, what he saw in Lexie. There is a sequel to this book. It is a continuation of Lexie and Jeremy’s story. But there is no cliff hanger with this one. It comes to a conclusion and you aren’t left hanging in any way."

3271,Holy Man: Father Damien of Molokai,Gavan Daws,3.89,95,15,Joselito Honestly and Brilliantly,3,"Like Father Damien of Molokai I had also once lived with lepers. Unlike him, however, I had lived with lepers at that time when modern medicine could already check the progress of the disease. So the lepers I had mingled with, although already scarred for life, were more or less already deemed ""cured."" The most common physical deformity I remember of them, practically all of them, was the way their hands looked. It seemed leprosy never exempt any of its victims with this: the fingers fold at their middle joints, like one sometimes see in comatose people in a vegetative state. So when they try to hold something (e.g. a chess piece during a game) it'd look like as if they had grabbed some glue and their fingers got stuck inwards to their palms.How I got to be with lepers was not as dramatic as the story of Father Damien of Molokai. My grandparents contacted this disease, maybe in the early 1930's during the American Occupation. They then already had their respective families and were living miles apart: my grandfather was from an island town south of Luzon while my grandmother was from the north. It is still a mystery up to now how one could suddenly get the disease in the middle of a community with no known leper around or any history of the disease but these two were among those unfortunate ones. I do not know if they surrendered themselves voluntarily or were among those who at first tried to hide from those rounding up the lepers upon orders of the American authorities, but both ended up at the leper colony in Culion, a remote island like Father Damien's Molokai, at the Palawan group of islands similar to the Hawaiian islands where Molokai was. The science of leprosy cure was still at its infancy at that time and they were probably both conscious that they had come to that beautiful island to die away from their families. They probably grieved for a long time, watched the sunrise and sunset for months, before finally casting their eyes upon each other and with their shared loneliness fell in love. They had three children and one of them--the middle child--was my father born in 1937, one of the 144 babies born that year in that leper colony.About half a century before, during Father Damien's time, they still had no idea how leprosy is transmitted from a leper to a healthy person. One theory was that it is hereditary. Well, in our case this had been proven false. My father, his two siblings, their numerous children and grandchildren never showed signs of the disease. I never met my grandfather. Apparently, after he and my grandmother were discharged from Culion he went back to his own family and died there. My grandmother, on the other hand, went to the Tala Leprosarium (now part of the Metro Manila area) where she got a house, raised many cats, established some businesses, and then, after my grandfather passed away, married another leper who had been cured (but with the same hands with folded fingers!), a veteran of World War 1. He was the grandfather I knew. And it was there at the Tala Leprosarium where I spent countless summer vacations and met my lepers. I'd say those were among the happiest days of my young life. I was a pimply youth but when I was with my lepers I felt like I had the nicest complexion in that entire community and was ready to do a soap commercial.Father Damien was born to a devout Catholic Belgian family. His elder brother was also a priest and a sister became a nun. Hawaii was then not yet a part of the USA. It was ruled by a monarch and its indigenous population was being decimated by diseases brought to the islands by white men. Among these was leprosy.At that time no medicine had worked yet against this biblical scourge. It was a horrible disease and meant a slow and sure death. To get a picture of how it kills, imagine the human body like its is a finely sculptured piece of candlewax with wicks all over. Then each of these are lighted one by one. As the body melts it'd take so many grotesque forms. That is leprosy.""It was one thing to volunteer to serve the diseased, but quite another to take the intimate measure of Kalawao (the leper colony in Molokai). Damien's ministry became a priesthood of worms, of ghastly sights and suffocating smells, of the most awful physical and spiritual misery. There were six hundred leprosy sufferers at the settlement; and, apart from the healthy Hawaiian 'kokua,' Damien was the only man there with a sound, uncorrupted body--the only 'haole', certainly.""Other priests making brief visits were reduced, often enough, to speechlessness or weeping incoherence; later, they would write horror-struck letters about the experience, full of revolting detail and exclamation points. Even at second hand the horror was fresh. One of Damien's visiting colleagues told another how 'he saw in the hospital a young woman aged about twenty, whose right side was nothing but a swarm of worms, thousands and thousands of them. All the intestines were bared, he saw the ribs as in a skeleton, but she was not suffering. He saw a leprous man busy cutting off a joint from his finger with a piece of glass. Finally he succeeded, and threw it tranquilly out the window as if it was cured, saying: there's an end to my trouble. Apparently the blood in the finger was poisoned, and it was as if a worm was devouring him from inside.'""Father Damien was just twenty-three when he left Europe as a missionary priest. Eventually, he was assigned--happily it must be added--to the leper settlement in Molokai where he served as pastor for sixteen years. A physically strong and robust man, many years passed before he himself got the disease. He went through the same sufferings as those of his flock. He succumbed to it on 15 April 1889. He was just 49 years old."

3284,Baby Minds: Brain-Building Games Your Baby Will Love,Linda Acredolo,3.64,191,27,Kelly,5,"This book is similar to another book I read this year: What's Going on in There? How the Brain and Mind Develop in the First Five Years of Life.[return][return]Although I enjoyed What's Going on in There?, I *loved* Baby Minds because it focused more on what you can do to help your baby's brain grow. And not in a baby-flashcards sort of way, either. The games they suggest are fun and easy to incorporate into your routine. For example, they recommend modeling some pretend play starting at around 6 months to foster creativity. So we've instituted a 3:00 Puppet Show in our house. My 8-month-old daughter loves it of course, but so do I! 3:00 is about the time I start counting down the minutes til my partner gets home from work so it takes my mind off the clock for a bit.[return][return]I also preferred how this book summarized the relevant research studies in an accessible way. The research they highlighted made me that much more motivated to try the corresponding games. And this book was much lighter on the biological details of development, which I didn't mind at all considering those were the parts of What's Going on in There? I found myself skimming.[return][return]Both books had needed reminders to parents that there's no way to be a ""perfect parent."" The message in Baby Minds is: Just do what works for you, and don't stress out if you're not doing every single game they recommend because every single game won't work for everyone.[return][return]This book also has a handy list of all the games at the back, which I find myself using a lot lately. On the weekdays when I'm at home with my daughter all day, I use up all my tricks by the early afternoon�we read books, we take a walk, we have a tickle fest, I feed her solid food. Then I'm bored and she's bored, and that's not good. So the list at the back is helpful for jogging my memory about other things we can do together that will be fun for both of us. In fact, that's exactly how the 3:00 Puppet Show came into existence!"

7624,Lord of the Flies,William Golding,3.65,1693636,27432,Silvana,5,"This book is horrifying. I'm scared like hell. Totally.I was expecting an adventure book telling about some children who got stranded in an island, but ended up with goosebumps.A bit of synopsis: A number of English school boys suffered from a plane accident causing them to get stranded in an uninhibited island. The period was maybe during the World War II. Trying to be civilized, they elected a leader for themselves as well started the division of tasks (hunters, fire-watchers, etc). Things turned bad when there's a power struggle between the group leaders, worsened by various sightings of a monster in the island. No, don't think about ""Lost"" because this is way different.No wonder I had goosebumps at the end, because this book is so true to what happens in the world today. When men tried to govern themselves (and started the whole process with goodwill inside), but blinded with egotism and lust for power, tragedy and destruction in society are inevitable.Human nature is corrupt, it only takes a trivial thing to make its nature controlled by nothing but malice. This book represents a perfect allegory for men. Culture fails repeatedly and no matter how hard we can repress it, nothing will ever stop the drive to become savages.Despite its length and easy-to-read narration, this is certainly one of the most haunting, powerful books I've ever read. Now I know why this book is listed in so many lists of greatest books in the 20th century."
6075,The Mourner's Song: War and Remembrance from the Iliad to Vietnam,James Tatum,3.86,7,2,Tom,5,"This book reminds me a lot of Paul Fussell's seminal The Great War and Modern Memory. Fussell is a bit more academic in his close reading of poetry produced by WWI, and his scope is somewhat narrower than Tatum's, arguing that the war led to advent of Modernism in literature (though, as Modris Ekstein points out in his brilliant Rites of Spring: The Great War and the Birth of the Modern Age, modernism had its start before the war, most famously in Stravinsky's Rite of Spring). Instead of charting change in literature wrought by war, Tatum, using the Iliad as his primary source, demonstrates that a striking consistency among literary works across periods and countries, as well as physical monuments such as public memorials and statues, reinforces universal and timeless longings and need to make sense of death in war. Far from being repetitive, Tatum deepens his argument in all sorts of fascinating ways, drawing connections among writers as diverse as Balzac, Woolf, Genet, and Oguma Hideo, just to name a few. And his analysis of Maya Lin's Vietnam Veteran's Memorial made me wish he had written it before my own visit to VVM years ago. Tatum has great command of his material, all the more impressive, considering the range of works he includes, and his style seems less, hmm, academic than Fussell's can be at times. In terms of tone, Fussell's rage at the insanity of war outweighs any tendencies to be pedantic, whereas Tatum's voice is more elegiac, which seems fitting, given his focus on remembrance, and his style can be impressively lyrical at times, but never self-indulgent, always in keeping with the topic of a given chapter. I had intended just to spot-read this book out of curiosity, but got hooked quickly and decided to read the whole thing.

You are already zapped of energy. You feel like going to a bar and have a couple of beer listening to a funky live band or the crooning of a lovely young lady. Or you want to go to a nearby mall and sit in the comfort of a dark movie house. Probably sleep to rest for a couple of hours if the movie turns out to be boring.But you decide to go as you planned at the start of the day. Your gym bag is in your car. You drag your heavy feet to the parking lot. To the gym. You know you have to do it your friend has been telling you that Henry James is good but you imagine the taste of cold beer quenching your thirst or the soft seat inside the theater or the pretty songbird wearing a plunging neckline or showing her slim smooth legs there are quick reads waiting for you like Ray Bradbury’s Farenheit 451 or that Flowers for Argenon by Daniel Keyes. But you know your body needs exercise. You are becoming fatter, heavier and your waistline is expanding. You resisted the quick but empty lure of beer or sleep at the movie house. Your heart is telling you that Henry James is an author to read. Like a zombie, you continued sleepwalking to the gym.After changing to your gym attire. You step on the treadmill. The solitude of working out. In the gym, you rarely talk to anyone. Henry James used a style that was distinctively his: wordy yet illuminating You are by yourself. Most of your friends don’t care about Henry James. You begin to walk. Warm up. After a couple of minutes, you increase the speed. Chug. Chug. Chug. It goes on and on. His storytelling went on and on. His characters came from New York, to England, went to Paris, then to Rome and then went back to England and finally went back to Rome. After the treadmill, you lift some weights as you also need to tone some muscles. His characters were varied. There was Isabel Archer fighting for her independence by refusing marriage proposals like there was not tomorrow but in the end she found with the wrong man: conceited, two-timer, treacherous and condescending. Some muscles are not supposed to be exercised right after a neighboring one. They could be contradicting each other and not only you will not get the maximum benefit from your workout but you are in the danger of having an injury like some pulled muscles. Isabel’s cousin Ralph Touchett is the “conscience” of the novel, telling by instinct whether the person-character is good or bad. He is sick but he is the only character that has the purest heart.You came to the gym gloomy and dragged your feet as you did not have the energy even to go up a couple of stairs. Some people agonize reading this kind of 19th century Victorian English But when you came out to go back to your car, you felt energized and refreshed. You felt triumphant that Isabel Archer was going back to Rome for Pansy not necessarily for Oswald. But she decided whatever her heart was telling her.

1598,"That Wilder Image (History of American Painting, Vol 2)",James Thomas Flexner,4,4,1,Christian,4,"Excellent book on the history of 19th-century American art. Flexner is infectiously enthusiastic about the subject, and has put together a very readable, very informative work.Sadly, the book has been out of print since the late 80s (originally published in 1962) and the pictures (at least in my 1970 paperback copy) are in black and white. However, it is easy enough to get a cheap copy used and I'm sure a majority of the pictures are available online in color. It could also use a little updating, as, for example, Church's Heart of the Andes is no longer ""obscured with grime as it hangs unloved on the walls of the Metropolitan Museum"". But the appreciation and criticism contained herein is still valid, and the book deserves its place on the bookstore shelf.I do have to feel for poor Flexner; he argued first and convincingly that the ""Rocky Mountain School"" of Bierstadt and Moran should be considered distinct from the ""Hudson River School"" of Cole and Church, yet the most recent Hudson River School book (although a rerelease from the 70s), American Wilderness, has a Bierstadt on the cover. I guess he lost that argument."
2058,Ghost In the Shell 2: Innocence (Novel-Hard Cover): After the Long Goodbye,Masaki Yamada,4,243,16,Speedtribes,5,"Somewhere online, I read a review that described 'After the Last Goodbye' (written as a prequel to the Japanese animated movie 'Ghost In the Shell: Innocence') as being a slow burning jazz song infused with an extended action sequence. And that’s exactly what this story is. This story is essentially three different stories. On one hand, it's an action thriller with yakuza, armored car chase scenes and explosions. On the other hand, it's an existential story of a cyborg and his own personal levels of humanity. As a third story-- one can say it's just a simple story of a man searching for his dog. Some people have compared this story to Bladerunner and Do Sleeping Androids Dream of Electronic Sheep. I would say: Certainly! This is, after all a cyberpunk novel. However, Masaki Yamada manages to give a sense of hopeful humanity that I often find missing in the nihilistic, painful and almost anarchist dystopias that one often finds cyberpunk worlds to be. Because the story is told from an adult outsider's point of view, this story gives an interesting angle to the old questions of what it's like to have friends, to want to live, to want to have some sort of meaningful interaction with other humans. It asks the rather melancholy questions of, ""How can one be certain that one is feeling something? Do my emotions and dreams become less and less legitimate the more hardware I add to my body and brain? Where is the legitimate emotion? The heart or the brain? Can I even be counted as human any longer?"" These questions are even more poignant because the man was once completely human and has very legitimate reasons to ask these questions.Despite the two typos I spotted, which is unfortunate and the editor's fault not the translator's; the translation is strong. It flows nicely and smoothly, without any sense of questionable synonym choice that sometimes appears in translated works. The prose is dreamy at times, melancholy, easily transitioning to something more coolly analytical and robotic. Other times, the voice is mildly sarcastic and amusingly self-aware. The main character knows he's big and scary, and his observations of people's reactions and his own attempts to mitigate his big scariness is fun to read. I bought the hardcover version of this book on impulse, drawn by the texture of the matte cover, and the wonderful size that fit snuggly in my hand. As I read, I kept saying to myself, ""Wow, this is good."" It turns out that writer is famous in Japan and winner of multiple awards in science fiction. Go figure. I have to say that I hope more of his books become available in English, because I am very much interested in reading them. This prequel to the latest Ghost in the Shell movie manages to do, textually, what the movie did visually. It fully compliments the movie conceptually. Where the movie failed in its script, Yamada picks up and runs with it in a far more effective manner. I have to say this book is an improvement to the themes and concepts that are presented in the movie and currently one of my favorite novels."
5256,Old New York: Four Novellas,Edith Wharton,4,1310,120,Duane,4,"In Henry James first letter to Edith Wharton, beginning what would be a long friendship, he advised her to write about what she was most familiar with, New York. That would set her on the course of writing what would come to define her literary legacy, her three classic novels of New York society, The House of Mirth, The Age of Innocence, and The Custom of the Country. The four novellas in this collection also follow this theme, and they were written when Wharton was at the height of her profession.4.5 stars"
5258,The Age of Innocence,Edith Wharton,3.93,116202,5137,Emily May,5," “We can't behave like people in novels, though, can we?” A few years ago, I read The Age of Innocence and thought it was okay. It has something of an Austen-esque feel - criticisms of middle/upper middle class society, paired with a subtle and clever humour and a love story (here deliciously scandalous). But it's taken me a few years to come back to this novel and appreciate the magic Wharton has brought to the table.This little book is so clever. Everything about it from the damn title to nearly every piece of dialogue is perfectly-placed and often ironic. Things that didn't hit me fully the first time around became so much more important in this reread. Wharton knows 1870s New York City like the back of her hand; she knows its habits, its traditions, and its expectations of people. She creates a rich, twinkly picture of parties and social standards that is both delightful and ultimately ridiculous - then she throws a spanner in the works.Never has a love triangle been so welcomed by me. This isn't the modern affair we're used to, where a girl must choose between hot guy #1 and hot guy #2. Nope, in this story, Newland Archer is torn between the stability, comfort and duty he can be offered by the socially-favoured match with May Welland... and his passionate, all-consuming love for the unconventional, rebellious and ostracized Ellen Olenska. 
  “Each time you happen to me all over again.” 
It's as important as it is beautifully written. Wharton casts an eye over this society, both disdainful and affectionate. Incorporating issues of female emancipation into the story, never has the idea of a woman enslaved by marriage and convention seemed so unattractive from a male perspective. Newland Archer is full of modernity and the call of new ideas, but finds that any freedom he poses to May she would receive only with the intention of pleasing him. Though, it should be said, I believe May is far more than she seems.It's hard to read the ending of this book without feeling emotional, but the exact emotion may differ with your interpretation. Ambiguity reigns supreme as this novel finds its close and even the coldest of unromantics will surely have their hearts pulled along for this... ride. One of my favourite tragic love affairs.
  “Only, I wonder – the thing one’s so certain of in advance: can it ever make one’s heart beat as wildly?”

2056,An Evening of Long Goodbyes,Paul Murray,3.61,1083,140,Steve,3,"Thirteen of my friends have read Skippy Dies with a consensus average rating of 4.5 stars. Two friends read An Evening of Long Goodbyes and gave it, on average, 2.5. This says two things: 1) I have clever, discerning friends, and 2) Paul Murray got better -- appreciably so, in fact. There may have been hints of the greatness to come in Skippy, but this, his first attempt, was honestly pretty uneven. Charles and his sister Bel are twenty-somethings living in the well-to-do part of Dublin. She is an aspiring actress and he is a man of leisure with an undue sense of entitlement. And wouldn’t you know, conflict somehow ensues. It was not a sustainable lifestyle: Charles had put a big dent in the previously impressive wine cellar, finances don’t just take care of themselves, and the grand old manor was becoming perceptibly less grand. Their father had passed away a few years before and their mother had been away for health reasons. They had a Bosnian refugee who did housekeeping, but her foothold in the real world was not enough to do them much good. Charles, the oblivious cad, was laughably bad. He might have been funnier still had there been any aspect of subtlety in the humor. Of course there’s a great tradition of “toff as twit” in Isles writing (think Bertie Wooster or certain Monty Python sketches), and I appreciated the attempt to accrue more, but can’t say that it was a complete success. I think the problem stemmed from inconsistency in the cluelessness. Charles narrated, which was for the most part a job well done, rife with affectation and flair. He even succeeded in telling jokes on himself (mistaken interpretations of responses to his buffoonery) without knowing they were jokes. My problem was in how he could display compelling insights into personalities at one moment and then be so callow and imperceptive the next.What I will give credit for is the narrative voice, at least when it was at its pompous and descriptive best. Here are two examples: [...] I was subjected to what he referred to, seemingly without irony, as his 'music'. Sometimes it sounded like a huge metal something -- a tank, maybe, or an enormous set of cutlery -- falling down an infinite staircase; sometimes it sounded like a hundred thousand Nazis, goosestepping through the Place de la Republique; the general idea seemed to be to capture the sound of civilization collapsing [...]
  [...] her expression with every passing second becoming more remote, like a Cinderella who has outstayed her time to see not only her carriage change back to a pumpkin, but Prince Charming's suitcase fall open and a whole horde of glass slippers fall across the floor [...]
There was an element of French farce to this -- and believe me, I counted off for it -- but it also had a few weightier themes that, in part, helped to compensate. One message, if you’ll excuse my reductive shorthand, is that a friend in need is a friend indeed. This wasn’t always so obvious to Charles, unless he was the friend in need. Another prime character, Frank, who was a big lunk of a guy, rough around the edges, and Bel’s boyfriend for a time, was Charles’s polar opposite. That may not have made Frank persona grata at the country club, but it did give him street smarts, empathy for the luckless and a certain personal dynamism. Seeing the contrasts between the two was one of the better parts of the book. Redemptions were wobbly, though, and the book generally hinged on what humor there was to be had.On its own merits, this gets maybe 3 stars. If we allow the lexically impossible and compare it to the incomparable (that is, Skippy Dies), it’s more like 2 stars. Ah, what the heck -- after a trip to Erin and succumbing to its rhetorical charms, let’s stick with 3."
5257,Summer,Edith Wharton,3.66,8462,698,karen,3,"this book is touted as ""edith wharton's most erotic book"". the introduction blabs on and on about its eroticism, and how scandalous it is. so i have devised a little drinking game. i invite you - i entreat you - to prepare a shot glass with your favorite scotch or whiskey, and do a shot every time you start feeling a little hot from all the sexy good times. i pretty much guarantee that shot glass will be untouched by the end of your readings. this book is not erotic, even in the broadest, most mormonic sense. i think there is a kiss or two, which for wharton is hot, but it's a stretch to call it ""erotic"". this is a book where people get preggers by proximity: two people of opposite genders are seated beside each other, and suddenly - the lady is up the pole. this might be the first appearance of the ""sexy librarian"" stereotype, but erotic?? far from it, ms. white gloves..."
6225,Return to the Future,Sigrid Undset,3.62,34,10,Nancy,3,"This book was included in a sort of ""grab-bag"" that I bought at a church event. It is the best of the bunch, and I could have easily given it 4 or 5 stars for being worthwhile, if that were the standard. The author is a Nobel prize for literature winner for previous books, obviously an intelligent and insightful individual. She writes of her flight from Norway, as the brave but unprepared Norwegian Army is being overrun by the Nazis. Her description of her train trip across Russia, the bleakness of its people and cities and its lack of the most basic hygiene or nutrition at the time, is unvarnished. When she reaches Japan, she wonders whether her more positive reaction to the Japanese people, even though she knows they are aggressors in a brutal war, is because they are so much cleaner and more pleasant, standards that are important to her Norwegian people. The last portion of the book is devoted to a summary of her strong political and sociological beliefs, and she expresses most strongly her negative feelings for the German people, attributing much of the responsibility for their history to innate traits. I imagine she would be surprised and pleased at Germany's place in the world today. It was very interesting to read her view of things from a time when she had no idea how the war would end."
6224,The Unknown Sigrid Undset: Jenny and Other Works,Sigrid Undset,4.24,41,10,Teresa,4,"I checked this out from the library, fully intending not to reread Jenny, but the introduction stated this new translation is livelier (in keeping with original) and not missing anything as the earlier translation does. I agree with the former, but each time I checked my old copy nothing seemed to be missing (I realize that's not a definitive search); perhaps it was only mere phrases here and there that had been left out of the 1921 translation.Though maybe a bit overwrought, Jenny is nevertheless psychologically astute and quite powerful (especially the ending which I had no memory of; perhaps it was too subdued in the original translation) as a portrait of a single female artist at the turn-of-the-(20th)-century, one who struggles with her own strict sense of self and the conflicting urges of love, loneliness, motherhood and her art. A few times I became impatient with dialogue that reads more like speeches or declarations, and also with the many descriptions of scenery, though I enjoyed the detailed ones of Rome: perhaps because I’ve been there or perhaps because Undset’s love of the city shines through.The short stories --- ""Thjodolf"" and ""Simonsen"" -- from her first two collections are straightforward, bleak and sympathetic to the working poor of Norway, especially as relating to 'unconventional' pairings of parent and child.The selection of letters, their first appearance in English, are from some of the many Undset wrote to a Swedish pen-pal who became a dear friend and confidante. The first included is written by an almost-eighteen-year-old Sigrid and the last included is from when she was thirty, immediately after the birth of her first child and the third printing of her second short-story collection. Undset is open about her literary aspirations and later her own unconventional ""sweetheart.""I came to this already an Undset fan, but the letters especially -- all written before her more-famous historical epics and her conversion to Roman Catholicism -- have whetted my appetite for even more about her life."
8821,"Complete Enderby: Inside Mr. Enderby, Enderby Outside, the Clockwork Testament, and Enderby's...",Anthony Burgess,4.11,396,19,Justin Evans,4,"As you'd expect from a collection of four novels written over a period of twenty years or more, this is uneven. The first two novels hand together quite well. In the first, Enderby tries to avoid engaging with the outside world; in the second, he is forced to do so. As with anything by Burgess, it's funny, wordy, and vocabulary-expanding. Enderby himself is a very ambiguous fellow. He's a truly horrific human being, but also strangely appealing to anyone who has elitist/artistic tendencies. The last two novels are a different matter. They don't hang together, either with each other or with the first two. The Clockwork Testament is the worst novel of the four, in terms of art (less well written, less unified) and morality (most contemporary readers will judge at least Enderby and possibly also Burgess to be racist) but also the most interesting in terms of literary history and philosophy: it is, quite obviously, a response to the American reception of A Clockwork Orange/i>. This is perfectly reasonable in purely intellectual terms. The novel was butchered by the film version, and Burgess was made to appear someone he really isn't (i.e., the film is a celebration of the individual freedoms so beloved by seventies radicals; the book is actually a rejection of the juvenile antics that bear some resemblance to the antics of seventies radicals); here, Enderby spends much time thinking about Dostoevskian themes of individual freedom, determinism, and predestination, in a fairly responsible manner, i.e., in exactly the manner that the film of ACO, and the aforementioned radicals, refused. Unfortunately, Burgess lets the radicals themselves into the book, and promptly becomes the kind of reductionist that he claims those radicals were. Racism is mostly in your head, and so is sexism, etc... No, they're not. The final novel, Enderby's Dark Lady, could almost be an apology for writing the Testament. The 'dark lady' of Shakespeare becomes a wonderful black American woman, who is far more intelligent, beautiful, sensible, and personable than Enderby... and also clearly a victim of blatant sexism and racism, which is not, as it was in the Testament, excused. It's also a very funny piece of anti-Americanism, if you like that kind of thing. And let's be honest, you got to the end of a review of a series of Anthony Burgess novels, so you probably do. Unfortunately, the last chapter of this last Enderby novel is very, very silly. "
6222,Jenny,Sigrid Undset,3.75,479,39,Alice Poon,4,"This is a heartbreaking story set in the distant past about a young Norwegian woman artist who is torn between her desire for self-development and her longing for true love. However, the values and principles behind the actions of the protagonist could well reflect the moral dilemma of many decent women of today with an educated mind. Is love or work more important?Born to an unwholesome family where fatherly love is lacking, Jenny has always had to fend for herself while growing up. Her greatest attributes – independence, sense of responsibility, moral fortitude, diligence, compassion for the weak – could be her invincible armor against any adversity in life. Just as she is set to go out and conquer the world, armed with artistic talent and an optimistic outlook on life, she trips up by making one small mistake – letting herself grow weak and be pampered by a short moment of tender love that she’s been long thirsting for (view spoiler)[Jenny falls in love first with Helge Gram but later realizes he is wrong for her. Then in a moment of weakness she falls for Helge’s father, who happens to want to embrace her with a consuming love, but whom she knows she can never truly love (hide spoiler)] – and she loses all control over her own fate. (view spoiler)[She gets pregnant by Helge’s father, then leaves him to give birth to the baby, intending to raise it by herself. But unfortunately the baby dies six weeks after birth, which devastates her. She then reunites with one of her artist friends Gunnar Heggen, who declares his love for her. She wants to accept his love but at this time Helge reappears. Helge makes love to her. (hide spoiler)]During her fateful love affair and in the aftermath, her independence, sense of responsibility and moral principles drown her in an emotional ebb of guilt, remorse and shame and abandon her to carrying all blame on her shoulders. Her disinclination to hurt others sends her into a downward spiral, from which she never recovers. Her greatest attributes become her greatest curse. Her life is ironically ruined by her longing for true love.Jenny said this to Gunnar, which sums up her life: “One day, I made a slight change in course. It seemed to me so difficult and harsh, living the life I thought was the most worthy – it was lonely, you know. So I veered away for a moment, wanting to be young and to play a little. And then I was caught in an undertow that carried me off, and I ended up in circumstances that I never for an instant imagined it would be possible for me to be anywhere near.”The novel makes one wonder: can the female soul ever overcome the longing for true love? Are women in truth just like what Gunnar describes: “so strong and erect in her striving, and yet so frail and brittle.”?"

9979,Der Prozess,Franz Kafka,3.98,162670,4859,Stephen,4,"Kafka is tough. Kafka doesn’t play and he doesn’t take prisoners. His ""in your grill"" message of the cruel, incomprehensibility of life and the powerlessness of the individual is unequivocal, harsh and applied with the callous dispassion of a sadist. Life sucks and then you die, alone, confused and without ever having the slightest conception of the great big WHY. Fun huh?Finishing The Trial I was left bewildered and emotionally distant, like my feelings were stuck looking out into the middle distance not really able to focus or provide me with any input. I felt numb and a bit soul-weary and I can’t say I enjoyed the feeling. That said, should you read this? Absolutely and without question. Kafka’s insight and ability to plumb the depths of the mysteries of existence, dark and gloomy as his answers (or lack thereof) may be, is something to behold. His work…is…brilliant. Reading it made me feel at times awed and at other times incredibly stupid. Awed occurred when I would catch a glimpse of the deeper meaning that he was trying to convey through his prose. In those moments I would try desperately to create a sturdy mental foothold from which to explore Kafka’s next idea. Unfortunately…Stupid, which happened more often, would occur when that next Kafkaesque lesson would bounce off my thick head, making me lose my tenuous foothold and go sliding back down Mount Ignorance. It was a difficult summit to reach and I was I'll-equipped. Still, the moments of clarity and flashes of insight were more than enough to make this an experience I intend to repeat until I get it right…or at least die trying. THE STORY:“Someone must have traduced Joseph K., for without having done anything truly wrong, he was arrested one fine morning.” Like Gregor Samsa in The Metamorphosis, we are introduced to Kafka’s protagonist after the damage has been done. We are not observing a downfall, it has occurred. We are witnesses to the aftermath, the clean up. Joseph K, an officer of a prestigious bank discovers he has been accused of a crime the nature of which he is never told. We follow him from situation to situation as his desire to learn the nature of his offense leads only to more confusion and greater strife. He is meant to remain in ignorance. “I see, these books are probably law books, and it is an essential part of the justice dispensed here that you should be condemned not only in innocence but also in ignorance.” THOUGHTS: So many themes are present here that it is hard to keep it all straight in my head. On the surface, we have a skillful attack on totalitarianism and the evil of a mindless bureaucracy fueled by momentum and accountable to no one as it grinds up the individual as grease for its continued motion. This alone is frightening enough and Kafka’s images of oppressive inertia unquestioned routine are tiny snapshots or hell itself. However, there seemed to be so much more that Kafka was saying, so many more levels on which his dark secular benediction could be understood. The System as life itself and the bureaucracy as fate and man’s useless struggle against the forces arrayed against him by the universe. Kafka also delivers a blistering rebuke of religion in the form of a parable in the Cathedral. I’m still trying to get me tiny brain entirely wrapped around this one, but the sense of sadness and crushing hopelessness of the story was still a gut punch.  ‘Everyone strives to attain the Law,' answers the man, 'how does it come about, then, that in all these years no one has come seeking admittance but me?' The doorkeeper perceives that the man is nearing his end and his hearing is failing, so he bellows in his ear: 'No one but you could gain admittance through this door, since this door was intended for you. I am now going to shut it.’ And later in this same conversation, “it is not necessary to accept everything as true, one must only accept it as necessary.”Still, as somber and dreary as the story is there are moments that are so brilliantly written that I actually found myself smiling despite the overall tone of the story. The Painter’s lecture to K about the difference strategies and processes involved in seeking among “actual acquittal,” “apparent acquittal” and “protraction” was nothing short of genius. In fact, given that the novel is only 200+ pages, I think those 15-20 pages are worth reading the entire novel. Overall, I am very satisfied to have finally read this as a personal exercise rather than a school-enforced trauma. I got a lot out of this. There were chunks of the book that I found slow and plodding, probably because I was stuck at the base of Mount Ignorance and didn’t absorb the ideas Kafka was dishing. Still, it did make for some dry reading time as Kafka’s writing is not ear-pleasing enough that you can simply enjoy the prose. His prose is good, but it is more a functional delivery system for his mind-rupturing ideas than for the beauty of the words themselves. Thus, for the moment, and given my imperfect understanding of all that Kafka had to say in this brilliant novel, I am going to say 4 stars. 4 stars full of staggering intellect and multi-layered, nuanced insight into “what it’s all about” delivered with the skill of a surgeon. I’ll be in the recovery room for a while. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION. "
5526,Dear John,Nicholas Sparks,4.01,459185,10693,Arlene,4,"Dear John by Nicholas Sparks is one of those books I've developed a love/hate relationship with. I love, love, love the first part of the book, and I immediately fell for the main character, John Tyree. But when he gets his Dear John letter, it was all down hill from there, and I have to say I was left in angst. The ending is to some extent depressing, but I do have to give it to Sparks because he paints a realistic picture. However, someone needs to let the man know that he's writing fiction and sometimes, it's okay to have a happily ever after. His readers would surely appreciate it.About the book… John Tyree's life is spiraling down hill when he decides to join the army. During a leave, he comes home and meets Savannah, and that's when his life takes a turn. They fall in love, and because of her, he learns how to forge a relationship with his father. He returns to his base in Germany with the hopes of coming home to Savannah when his tour is over. Then 9/11 hits, and he makes a choice that will change his life forever.Great story, with a realistic yet off-of-the-charts sad ending. Let's just say, I'll proceed with caution when choosing another Sparks book in the future."
7835,Sentimental Journeys,Joan Didion,4.06,53,5,Mary Ronan Drew,4,"The title essay in this collection is about the Central Park Jogger case and that is why I read the book, but I found that the rest of it, though dated, provided some worthwhile reading. Didion always writes well and she does a fine job here of exploring the mood of New York City and how it contributed to the media frenzy the jogger crime induced.The sentimental journeys she refers to are the “memories” of the city as it never was and the current feeling (in 1989) that crime was out of control and everything was in decline. There is a case to be made that all that was true at that time. She also explores the unspoken but ever-present white racism as many perceived it in the media discussion of the case and the trial.Another essay, on the 1988 election, is of course dated in some ways but her astute observations on a presidential race apply to any political election these days. One example of the artificiality of campaigning: When Michael Dukakis (who was running against George H W Bush) addressed a crowd at one campaign stop the cameras couldn’t be set up to film him properly and so he made his speech with his back to the crowd. He made three short campaign stops: in a Puerto Rican neighborhood, a Jewish Hadassah meeting, and I forget the other. Not many people were at any of these stops and they were remarkably unenthusiastic. That wasn’t the point – the point was he had covered his constituent groups and got filmed for the evening news. His opponent conducted a similar campaign.Didion also discusses Hawaiian real estate, an endlessly fascinating subject. Something like 15% of the land is owned by the US government, another 15% by the state, and of the remaining land 70% is owned by large estates, especially the Bishop estate. So “buying” a house in Honolulu actually means leasing land with a house on it. If the lease is long you’re fine, though “selling” it if you stay too long can be difficult. If the time remaining on the lease is short, the cost could quadruple on you. The author also describes a Vietnamese/ethnic Chinese camp in Hong Kong, the Patricia Hearst story, the nuclear facility at Berkeley and Lawrence Livermore Labs, earthquakes in California, and much more.This book is particularly lovely to hold. It’s 5 ½ x 9 ½ inches and the paper is thick and a cream color. The cover is nondescript, alas. 2011 "
5527,All the King's Men,Robert Penn Warren,4.08,47351,2016,Jeffrey Keeten,5,"""Man is conceived in sin and born in corruption and he passeth from the stink of the didie to the stench of the shroud."" Robert Penn WarrenRobert Penn Warren is the only person to win the Pulitzer prize for fiction as well as poetry. He won the prize for fiction in 1946 for this very book. If you are lucky enough to have a great aunt who reads, and bought a lot of books in the 1940s, you might take a gander at her books some time and see if she has a first edition, first printing of this book in her library.   First edition, First printing of the 1946 editionDepending on the condition of the dust jacket a true first will bring anywhere from $2,000 to $7,000. It will be up to you; if you decide to ""liberate"" the book, tucking it under your shirt, and sneaking it out with the paper bag of home made oatmeal cookies she always sends you home with. If you are not a natural felon you might just say ""hey auntie couldn't you tuck this in a safety deposit box and put my name on it"". The last time I was in New Orleans they were shooting the new movie version of All the King's Men. We sat in a little cafe across from where they were setting up a shoot hoping for a glimpse of one of the marquee actors involved in the production. No luck, just film crew people bustling around trying to build a street scene. We were anxious to explore the little bookshops and artist galleries in the French Quarter, so we left before seeing anything truly interesting. I have not seen the 1949 or 2006 film versions. From the reviews I skimmed, both movies seem to struggle to capture the true essence of the book. I'm not surprised, even if they put the book through a small holed strainer, they would still have way more material than what a standard length movie can handle. 
  1949 Movie Poster
  2006 Movie PosterJack Burden, newspaper reporter, finds himself following around an ambitious, well meaning, but naive candidate named Willie Stark. A man hand picked to split the vote in the primary and insure the nomination of the customary corrupt, crony, politician that Louisiana is famous for. Stark is the only person who is unaware that the fix is on. He is stumping and receiving discouraging indifference from his crowds as he tries to tell them the truth. As he finds himself on the ropes more than he is in the ring, he starts to understand that to be successful he will have to give the crowds what they want. He replaces substance with hyperbole, and Burden observes the emergence of a candidate and the corruption of an honest man. Warren based Stark on the dynamic personage of Louisiana governor Huey P. Long. 
  Huey P. LongBurden soon finds himself unemployed, but Stark always liked him and gave him a prominent position on his staff. Stark, though soundly defeated, uses the time between elections to become a polished orator and electable candidate. Burden studied for a history degree in college and believes from his studies that truth will always win out. As he becomes more ensnared in the shady activities of Governor Stark's administration he starts to stumble over his own high ideas of the worthiness of truth. He tries to convince himself that he just does what the boss wants him to do. What the boss does with the information he brings him has nothing to do with him, but the longer he is involved, and the more people he knows who become victims of Stark's ambition the less distance he can claim.""I didn't mean to cause any ruckus. I didn't think--"" And all the while that cold, unloving part of the mind--that maiden aunt, that washroom mirror the drunk stares into, that still small voice, that maggot in the chess of your self-esteem, that commentator on the ether nightmare, that death's-head of lipless rationality at your every feast--all that while that part of the mind was saying: You're making it worse, your lying is just making it worse, can't you shut up, you blabbermouth!""Burden is in love with Anne Stanton, his childhood friend and the daughter of a previous governor. Briefly they are an item and then they drift apart. Burden marries Lois, the woman who has the ""peach bloom of cheeks, the pearly ripe but vigorous bosom, the supple midriff, the brooding, black, velvety-liquid eyes, the bee-stung lips, the luxurious thighs."" Despite these attributes they have different goals and different ambitions and the elephant in the room is the fact that Jack is still in love with Anne. He becomes close friends with Anne again. He can't help but make allusions to the fact that his marriage proposal is still on the table. Even though she is 35 and never been married she continues to dance around the issue. Burden can't ever see her as just a friend.""It was Anne Stanton herself, who stood there in the cool room of the looking glass, above the bar barricade of bright bottles and siphons across some distance of blue carpet, a girl--well, not exactly a girl any more, a young woman about five-feet-four with the trimmest pair of nervous ankles and smallish hips which, however, looked as round as though they had been turned on a lathe, and a waist just the width to make you wonder if you could span it with your hand, and all of this done up in a swatch of gray flannel which pretended to a severe mannish cut but actually did nothing but scream for attention to some very unmannish arrangements within.""Stark still sees himself as one of the good guys despite the number of men he has felt compelled to destroyed. He came to the conclusion that it was better to destroy them than to bribe them. If he bribes them he still has to keep those untrustworthy associates in his organization. If he destroys them they can no longer thwart his ambitious aims. He is on a self-imposed mission to use the corrupt system, but use it for good.""Goodness. Yeah, just plain, simple goodness. Well you can't inherit that from anybody. You got to make it. If you want it. And you got to make it out of badness. Badness. And you know why? Because there isn't anything else to make it out of.""When Burden experiences the ultimate betrayal it hit me like a left hook coming out of the smokey darkness of an Oklahoma bar. I never saw it coming and I had to stagger away from the book for a while. Jack took 8 days and ran away to California. I took thirty minutes to go stand out on my deck and let some fresh air sort my scattered thoughts.There is a whole marvelous section on Cass Mastern, Jack's relative, who provides a colorful history for Jack to research for his PHD. I almost need a separate review to handle the intricate betrayals explored by Warren in that section. I notice that the departure from the main story line bothered other reviewers. I just thought I'd been handed another thick seam of gold to be mined. I like history and I especially like family history, so I didn't mind the story in the story at all. Political cynicism wrapped in lyrical prose makes this one of the more fascinating books I've read in many, many years. It is an honest book, exposing all the worst elements of human behavior. We are so good at fooling ourselves into thinking that when we do wrong for the greater good we are still on the side of the angels. Highly recommended!!If anyone has any political novels that they love, and feel I should read, please send me your recommendations.

422,A Book of Common Prayer,Joan Didion,3.81,2689,253,orsodimondo,5,"LA DONNA SPEZZATA Il libro delle preghiere comuni è il testo base della comunione anglicana.Mi chiedo se le preghiere comuni sono quelle più semplici, o invece comuni sta per collettive.E mi chiedo cosa abbia a che fare con questo romanzo, visto che il titolo originale è proprio A Book of Common Prayer.Domanda che rimane senza risposta, un grosso punto interrogativo dalla prima all’ultima pagina. Mai incontrato titolo più enigmatico.Da tempo è previsto un adattamento cinematografico di questo magnifico romanzo, avrebbe già dovuto essere completato, e invece se ne sono perse le tracce. Qui, l’attore-regista Campbell Scott, incaricato della regia e del ruolo del marito di Charlotte.Mi ha colpito la sensazione che in questo racconto di una donna narrato da un’altra donna, Didion sappia esattamente cosa scrivere, non perda tempo, ma sappia sfruttare quello a sua disposizione, senza eccesso, né di risparmio né di prodigalità.Didion trattiene l’emozione, anche se il melodramma è alla base del mondo che descrive: si adopra per risparmiare parole e scegliere quelle sottotono facendo ampio ricorso all’ironia. Sa rimanere distaccata mentre penetra a fondo. Eppure l’emozione mi arriva, in certi momenti perfino struggente.Ghiaccio bollente, è la sintesi che mi viene alla mente per descrivere questa sensazione.Due donne protagoniste, molto diverse.La narratrice, prossima alla morte per malattia, che sembra saperla lunga, sul mondo la vita e la gente, ma non è mai saccente, mai un passo avanti agli altri: anzi, sembra preferire restare un passo indietro, per poter studiare meglio il proprio interlocutore - privilegia ascoltare piuttosto che spargere il sale della sua esperienza. È di rara onniscienza riguardo ai fatti che coinvolgono la protagonista, la fica norteamericana.Christina Hendricks che dovrebbe interpretare Charlotte.E Charlotte, intorno alla quale ruota la storia del romanzo – Charlotte così ingenua da credere che geografia e storia universali siano ricalcate sulla California e gli US in genere. Ma anche nella sua ignoranza, Charlotte è innocente, quasi vittima. È una preda, circondata da mariti che non brillano per empatia e comprensione, è una madre respinta dalla figlia cui forse ha sottratto attenzione una volta di troppo. Una figlia alla quale non ha saputo spiegare il mondo perché neppure lei madre lo ha capito. La morte la coglierà per caso, come per caso le è capitata tutta la vita.Chi non ha più nulla di innocente, chi ha perso completamente ogni traccia d’innocenza è il mondo: nello specifico, il continente americano, il mondo nuovo.È successo già tutto: l’assassinio di JFK e poi di suo fratello Bob, di Malcom X e Martin Luther King – il Vietnam è un carnaio senza uscita – Charles Manson – i figlio dei fiori si sono trasformati in ben altro – l’esercito di Liberazione Simbionese ha già rapito e cooptato Patricia Hearst (Marin, la figlia terrorista di Charlotte?) – l’11 settembre, il primo 11 settembre, il golpe cileno – e mentre Didion scriveva e stava per pubblicare, la guerra sporca argentina inventava i voli della morte e moltiplicava i desaparecidos…Allison Janney che dovrebbe interpretare Grace, la narratrice.Didion mi ha riportato con forza agli anni Settanta.Come leggere un libro di Vidal. Come vedere quei film surreali dai dialoghi assurdi scritti da Jules Feiffer dove le star erano Elliott Gould, Alan Arkin, Donald Sutherland…Joan Didion è stata una sorpresa che non mi aspettavo, e ancora faccio fatica a chiarire la mia reazione, il mio pensiero. Si dice che le cose migliori scritte da Didion siano di non-fiction, prima di tutto di giornalismo. Io ho cominciato assaggiando proprio la fiction: vuol dire che mi aspettano tante altre belle scoperte.Joan Didion, che sarebbe stata la migliore Grace immaginabile."
8820,The Doctor is Sick,Anthony Burgess,3.65,914,39,MJ Nicholls,4,"This rambunctious brain-surgery-gone-bad comedy is the liveliest and most schizophrenic novel from Burgess yet. The professor protagonist Edwin is scheduled for a brain operation from an eccentric trumpet-playing doctor, but after his head is shaved for the procedure, flees the hospital into an underworld of kettle-selling sadomasochists, phonetic Cockney wideboys, German vamps, bald-headed men competitions, and promiscuously adulterous wives. Rich in various dialects (East London to German to Scots to RP) and whizz-bang verbal dexterity, this comic novel sees Burgess coming into his own as a master of language and intellectually accessible humour—a barmily unpredictable writer capable of seemingly anything. Seriously hilarious."
6575,The Collapse of Globalism: And the Rebirth of Nationalism,John Ralston Saul,3.7,309,23,Eric,3,"This book give an overview of how the neo-liberal economic experiment has been installed in most of the world since the 1970's. This book is a healthy critique of what was promised by the proponents of neo-liberal economics, things like the trickle down theory (give to the rich it will eventually benefit the poor), cut taxes and grow the economy, and trade always equals economic growth, and how neo-liberal economics and globalization has only benefited a small percentage of the world (1%?). Saul points out that economic success stories like China, India and Brazil have done it by NOT embracing neo-liberal economics fully. For example China has significant controls on its cash flows and you can not speculate on its currency. All three countries are highly centralized and controlled. I've read a lot of books on this subject but I still managed to learn a lot from this book. Saul believes that most of the world and its politicians are re-learning the power of the nation state and moving away from neo-liberal economics. Unfortunately for Canada Stephen Harper is still a believer..."
6576,All Fall Down,John Saul,3.82,556,10,Dirk Grobbelaar,4,"All Fall Down is also published as The God ProjectThe door was slightly ajar.There was no sound from within, and for a moment [she] felt an unreasonable sense of panic.This is an uneasy read.The first half of the novel is innocuous enough. A bit leisurely even. That is… until the trap is sprung and you realise that the false sense of security was exactly what the author was counting on.I had some suspicions, and even although at least one turned out to be true, I didn’t quite see the ending coming. This is one of those books that will haunt me for a while yet. We can do anything we want to, because nothing can hurt us.This is exactly the kind of philosophy that gets someone killed. Saul did pull the rug from under me, but it’s a good thing, since it’s that very fact that made me up the rating from three to four. It’s scary stuff, but not in the way you think. To truly understand, you would have to read it. "
6578,The Unloved,John Saul,3.85,3737,83,Sandra,4,"When Kevin Devereaux finds out his elderly mother (Helena) is dying he decides to go back home to Sea Oaks (a mansion which is on a secluded island off the South Carolina coast) for a brief stay with his wife Anne, his daughter Julie, and his son Jeff. He hasn’t been back there for twenty years. (He left Sea Oaks because he has never liked his mean, malevolent mother and wanted to get away from her dominating presence.) When they arrive they meet Kevin’s sister, Marguerite, and Kevin’s cruel mother. Not long after they are there, old Helena dies.Now that Helena is dead Kevin’s wife (Anne) can’t wait to leave Sea Oaks (which is very old, run down, shabby, and dilapidated) and go back home. But unfortunately, when Helena’s will is read, Kevin is forced to stay and live at Sea Oaks or else his sister Marguerite will lose her home (she lives at Sea Oaks). The kids like the place, Anne hates it. Anne thinks Kevin is crazy when he starts talking about turning the decrepit mansion into a hotel. Not long afterward people start dying and go missing. And why is Marguerite acting so weird?This was another enjoyable read by John Saul. It had sort of a sinister, disturbing feel. I liked the setting at the old mansion and the atmosphere of the place. There was an interesting cast of characters. Some I liked, (Anne, Julie, Jeff...) some I hated (especially Kevin's mother Helena, what a horrible old hag she was!). One character was really totally insane. This book kept me turning the pages and I was curious to see what was going to happen next. I was sad to see some characters die. (view spoiler)[I wasn't totally happy with the epilogue but I guess the author was implying insanity must run in the family? (hide spoiler)]An entertaining, strange, and creepy read."

There is an interest, and he's no more the bore.Perchance to read, perchance to befriend-More to say when we get to the end. And so we have, endured to bookThis note on Chaucer of which I betookThe edition is but somewhat truncatedYou'd hope fuller but had been authenticated.Onward I trudge with heavy heartThis most earthy poet with whom I should now partHas led me to see indeed possessedLiveliness and wisdom, both expressed.And so we go, to find againA worthy edition of this tale but told more plain."
2718,Salt in His Shoes: Michael Jordan in Pursuit of a Dream,Deloris Jordan,4.19,867,133,Megan Piero,4,"This story was written by Michael Jordan's mother and sister and tells about his childhood. When Michael Jordan was younger, his older brothers always played basketball at a nearby court. Michael always wanted to play with them but he was much younger and smaller so he was only allowed to play when one of the older boys wasn't there. When he did have the rare opportunity to play, he often couldn't shoot well because everyone was so much taller than him. He became very frustrated. When he went home he told his mother how he was feeling and she comforted him by telling him that she had a cure to help him grow taller. She told him that she would put salt in his shoes and that if they both prayed each night, it would help them grow taller.Michael decided to not go play with the older boys for awhile while he was waiting to grow taller and practiced around the house. he waited for months and practiced very hard. One day, he measured himself but was very upset when he realized he hadn't grown an inch. When he went to talk to his dad about it, his dad told him that height wasn't what was important. It was practice that mattered. Feeling great, Micheal went down to the park and demanded to play with the older boys. He ended up winning the game for his team, regardless of his height.As a teacher, I think this book has a lot to offer. I think the message from this book is that even famous stars had to start somewhere. I think it also shows that everyone gets frustrated at some point in life but it's our perseverance that makes us grow. I would definitely have this book in my class and I know I will use it every year no matter what grade I'm teaching."
2719,The Book of Salt,Monique Truong,3.48,4005,601,Whitaker,1,"An epic failure of research and imagination. The reviewers on GR who have rated this novel highly have generally praised its poetic evocation of love and loss. Okay, I can get that. The novel is an extended dirge of a life spent in unrequited longing as a result of a loveless childhood and an equally loveless adulthood. All of it told in prose like this:I am at sea again. I am at sea again. Not the choppy, churning body that bashes open a ship's hull like a newborn's soft skull. Yes, a sapphire that a ship's bow skims and grooves. A calming blue expanse between now and Sunday.That little paragraph is a description of the main character's emotions after learning that his current lover wants to see him again the next weekend. Here's another sample, this time the main character, Bình, describes love:Quinces are ripe, GertrudeStein, when they are the yellow of canary wings in midflight. They are ripe when their scent teases you with the snap of green apples and the perfumed embrace of coral roses. But even then quinces remain a fruit, hard and obstinate—useless, GertrudeStein, until they are simmered, coddled for hours above a low, steady flame. Add honey and water and watch their dry, bone-coloured flesh soak up the heat, coating itself in an opulent orange, not of the sunrises that you never see but of the insides of tree-riped papayas, a colour you can taste. To answer your question, GertrudeStein, love is not a bowl of quinces yellowing in a blue and white china bowl, seen but untouched.If that kind of writing is what you like, then go for it. Unfortunately, that is all you are going to get here. And frankly, that's far too little for me. It's irritating to be jerked out of a prose induced reverie when a metaphor for the forming of opinions is written thusly:But once they are formed, ours become the thick, thorny coat of a durian, a covering designed to forestall the odour of rot and decay deep inside.Now obviously, the writer does not know (a) that among us South-east Asians, durians are called the king of fruit and that odour is highly prized and (b) yes, you can smell that odour even with the thick thorny coat on. No indigenous Vietnamese man would describe the durian thusly. It would be the equivalent of a French chef referring to the smell of a Roquefort as putrid, decaying rot. In a fairly crucial plot point, she refers to Bình’s grandmother giving jade earrings as a dowry for his mother. That jangled for me instantly, since in Vietnamese culture it is the groom that is required to give a dowry (or, strictly, the bride-price). She writes of ancestor “worship” thus:After my mother gave birth to me, there were many things she could no longer pray to her father and mother about. They would have disowned her. Then whom would she have left to worship, whose likeness would she have left to reconfigure from memory for her family altar? There is no forgiveness in ancestor worship, only retribution and eternal debt.That is extremely irritating to read. It's an outsider’s description marking mostly a complete failure of understanding. Asians don’t worship ancestors the way Christians worship their God. A closer term would be ancestor veneration. There is no prayer or conversation with ancestors akin to confiding in God and the saints. Incense, food, and other offerings are made by way of both showing respect and to feed them in the afterlife. And the family altar is never never never kept via the woman. That’s why sons are so important. A woman is married out into the husband’s family. She takes HIS ancestors. There were other clunkers like this that kept popping up, but what finally did the novel in for me were Bình’s descriptions (and this is first-person narrative) of things that happened between Alice B Toklas and Gertrude Stein, private conversations that he, a servant who could not speak English, could not possibly have overheard or—having overheard—understood. He describes, for instance, a fight that takes place between Gertrude Stein and her brother Leo before he arrives to work for them, and the ensuing private conversation between Alice and Gertrude:[Leo]…concluded for all to hear that Gertrude’s writing was nothing more than babble…“Babble!” GertrudeStein complained to Miss Toklas. “Lovey, there can only be one,” Miss Toklas whispered, repeating the phrase that would absolutely, mercilessly sever GertrudeStein from her brother Leo, her only one…. Leo wrote a note to his sister, as they had chosen to no longer speak, accusing Miss Toklas of stealing her away from him. When Miss Toklas read this, she laughed, and wrote back, “Your sister gave herself to me.”Okay, Bình doesn’t speak English much less read it, so the only way he would know of the contents of the two letters is if the two of them told him of this. Yes, I can see that happening: the two mistresses confiding this very private event to their cook. Total bollocks! But why include this event then? Does it pertain in any way to Bihn's story or his development as a character? No. It seems to be written in only so that Truong can impart this stunning bit of writerly post-modern wisdom: “How true, I think. A gift or a theft depends on who is holding the pen.” If Monique Truong had wanted to write a fictionalised account about Gertrude Stein and Alice B Toklas, she should have done just that rather than putting words into the mouth of a badly realised, imperfectly imagined sock puppet who would also come off sounding like a cross between a badly written Hallmark card and a Vietnamese version of Charlie Chan."
2720,Water & Salt:: The Essence Of Life: The Healing Power of Nature,Barbara Hendel,3.92,51,5,Janiece,4,"***Just had to update my review because I have now put the information in this book into practice and am absolutely astounded at the results! It is a miracle and truly more valuable to me than gold. It feels good to feel so good and to have the energy and ability to function day after day after day from morning to evening. I had made the sole and had it sitting in my house for four years and had no idea what a treasure I had. Could have saved me a whole lot of grief and lost opportunities if I had taken it way back then. But then it is not me to blindly try something just from a recommendation ... I need to know and I need to understand the why. I was soo far gone by that time that reading was not something I could do much of. This book coupled with hard experience and other things I have learned on the journey came together in one big aha! It was a major piece of the puzzle. How wonderful to have such a kind creator who left us with an abundance of what we need in the earth! So simple, so abundant, so affordable, so doable. I am truly grateful. Read the book and find out for yourself or if you don't have the time or ability, give the sole a try anyway so that you don't miss out on life and precious years with your family and community like I did. The sole is for everyone, healthy or ill, depressed or anxious, overwhelmed or fatigued, arthritis, diabetes and on and on ... I believe this will help. It is one of the essentials in life. Plain and simple.Parts of this book are right down fascinating! I appreciated this book more now than I would have in the past simply because it reconfirmed some things that I have already discovered both in other areas of study and from my own experience. While the jury is still out on parts of the book, I did gain much from it. The best part of the book was the discussion of salt. The value of and need for salt, natural salt in particular (as opposed to sodium chloride in the form of table salt), is grossly underestimated and misunderstood by mainstream America and it is wreaking havoc among us. Crazy how we can complicate things so much so easily. How reassuring it is to know that something as simple as crystal salt can make such a difference in your health and wellbeing. It already has in mine, but I have experienced the extreme lack of salt as my body simply cannot hold onto it or get adequate amounts with problematic adrenal glands. Having adequate salt makes all the difference in my ability to think or function - (and because of this book I have a greater understanding of why that is!) Crystal salt contains all of the minerals and trace elements that our body is made up of and historically was more precious than gold and used as a form of payment. Salt can balance an energy deficit. Don't miss out on understanding the importance of this vital nutrient whether you read it from this book or saltinstitute.org or both. My life is about to get even more simple because of what I now know and understand.Now, don't get me wrong, the discussion on water was great too teaching me more than I could have imagined about water."
2717,"The No-Salt, Lowest-Sodium Cookbook: Hundreds of Favorite Recipes Created to Combat Congestive Heart Failure and Dangerous Hypertension",Donald A. Gazzaniga,3.84,74,4,Missy,5,"My 37 year old husband has had a rough year. He was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and then had a very damaging heart attack. Like the author of this book, he was told he may need a heart transplant. Of course he/we have been eating better and trying to find the most flavor bang for our buck AND sodium count. We love to eat out and try all kinds of foods and we wanted to keep that as a part of our life. I have loved this book because it reads like more than a cook book. I enjoyed sitting down and reading it, I looked forward to going back to it despite the fact that I was so bummed about NEEDING it in my life when I picked it up. I cannot say that about many of the chronic disease diet books I have been browsing!In addition to the recipes, the book gives a great primer on low-sodium eating, where sodium is found, what it is used for, and how to live low-sodium all the time. The author goes to great lengths in his own life to be at around 500mg of sodium a day, super low, and it is inspiring to read his commentary. I also like the board of people he used to help write the book. Even better, my husband and I have enjoyed all of the recipes we have tried so far. I like how the recipes are not bland and all areas of dinning are covered (comfort food, holidays, potlucks, light snacks, dressings, salads, sweets). The nutrition information on each dish is included, which is helpful for other areas of diet that we are monitoring. The book has me excited because it is helping me adapt my cooking and shopping to what I was hoping: that being low-sodium does not mean flavorless and boring."
3352,Open City #9: Bewitched,Open City Magazine,4,1,1,Eric,4,"I bought this a decade ago for the Ames and Dyer pieces and only now picked it up to read from cover-to-cover. It has me feeling a little misty-eyed for the heydays of numerous literary journals on newsstands in musty bookstores with terrible service. The aforementioned stories are quite good, though I believe both were included in their authors' respective essay collections. This may have been where I first read Sam Lipsyte whose ""Cremains"" wasn't his best but was enjoyable. Others were less successful, especially Branca's piece and some of the poetry.It does have me curious about David Lida whom I'll have to seek out. I've also just discovered that Open City is still publishing so I'll have to pick up the most recent volume."
3349,Burning Man: Art in the Desert,A. Leo Nash,3.87,54,12,Grady,5,"The Inconstancy of ArtFor those unfamiliar with BURNING MAN, the promotional material for this annual unique art event is described here: 'Once a year, tens of thousands of participants gather in Nevada's Black Rock Desert to create Black Rock City, dedicated to community, art, self-expression, and self-reliance. They depart one week later, having left no trace whatsoever. ' Or in other places 'Art at Burning Man, like the experience of being there itself, is a way of being outside routine existence: People return home rejuvenated and inspired to seek ways to express the spirit of the festival in their everyday lives.' And as Wikipedia expands 'The event starts on the Monday before and ends on the day of the American Labor Day holiday. It takes its name from the ritual burning of a large wooden effigy on Saturday evening. The event is described by many participants as an experiment in community, radical self-expression, and radical self-reliance.' BURNING MAN: ART IN THE DESERT is as fine a documentation of this phenomenon as is available. The author is a photographer A. Leo Nash who with his funky photographic kinks has captured thirteen years of this week of art in the desert, and the results are exciting and rewarding. This well designed and produced book offers insights into this ritual. The art created for this event varies from construction of found objects to three-dimensional sculptures brought or transported to the site for the fellow artists (and growing public of art lovers) to 'experience'. There is something about the light of the desert that transforms this work, making the whole seem more important than its component parts. And much of that art is due to Nash's experimental photography that has become very much a part of this episodic, temporary contemporary art exhibition/happening. Reading or viewing this beautifully slipcovered memento will likely result in an increased audience for this very fresh and invigorating art. Some of the works in the BURNING MAN have included the 1908 ""The End"" by Bob Marzewski, a very impressive huge sculpture of stacked blocks that spell out THE END. But the variety of what is here in this book will definitely entertain the reader and give further credence to the idea that great art can be of the moment, then dismantled and moved on. BURNING MAN says more about our current way of experiencing life than perhaps the artists and even A. Leo Nash expected. It is well worth the attention of everyone who craves creativity, even transient creative works. Grady Harp"
3345,1968: The Year That Rocked the World,Mark Kurlansky,3.77,1807,216,Clif Hostetler,3,"The year 1968 was memorable for me personally. Coincidentally it was a remarkable year for the rest of the world as well. I was attracted to this book by the anticipation that it would provide a time capsule of an era when the baby boomer generation was young and crazy. It's sobering to realize that we are nearing the 50th anniversary of that fateful year.In January of 1968 I graduated from college with my BS engineering degree which awarded me the necessary credentials to land a job qualifying me to receive an occupational deferment from the military draft. Also, on February 2, 1968 due to a string of unlikely coincidences I met the woman who five years eight months later became my wife. (view spoiler)[We're still happily married. (hide spoiler)] Thus 1968 was for me the beginning of both my professional life and the relationship that evolved into my marital life.The ""draft"" was front and center at that time for young men my age because, depending on one's lottery number, they were being sent to the Vietnam War. My occupational deferment needed to be renewed annually, and there was no assurance that it would be renewed. Thus it was an ominous threat haunting future plans.Of course this book did not address my personal situation described above. It is focused on happenings such as the Tet offensive, the My Lai massacre, the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy, the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago, the Prague Spring, and the  1968 Summer Olympics with its notorious black power salute.In 1968 it seemed as if every country in the world was having riots in the street. Regarding student demonstrations, Kurlansky didn't overdo Berkeley and Columbia at the expense of Paris, Warsaw or Mexico City. (view spoiler)[I had totally forgotten about the Tlatelolco massacre that happened in Mexico City shortly before the Olympics opened. It's possible that I didn't even know about it in 1968. Even today there is wide disparity in the estimates of the numbers of demonstrators killed. (hide spoiler)] It was a time when all students felt that if they didn't protest something they would be missing out of doing the ""in thing."" Even students in high schools prepared their own ""underground newspapers.""The gains and costs of the new ethic of mass demonstration are neatly illustrated by the U.S. presidential campaign. The antiwar demonstrations helped force the effective abdication of President Lyndon Johnson—which resulted in the election of the ""silent majority"" spokesman Richard Nixon. (view spoiler)[(An example of unintended consequences.) (hide spoiler)]Without shortchanging the roles of race and age, Kurlansky highlights the rise of television as a near-instantaneous conduit of news. There's a chapter on the rise of second wave feminism providing a compact but thorough review of that subject. The music scene—shift to psychedelic rock—and the drug scene—marijuana and LSD—are also recounted. In order to provide background and context to these various issues the book includes discussion of happenings in preceding and subsequent years, thus providing a fairly complete post-war history."
3347,The Basque History of the World: The Story of a Nation,Mark Kurlansky,3.84,2957,295,Finooola,5,"Looking back on reading this one I'm most fascinated by the fact that the author, while slightly in awe of the legend of the Basque people, is in no way afraid to show the ugly sides to their history as well. I think most people who are interested regard the Basques as the eternal heroic outsiders. But this book doesn't shy away from showing how often and how easily racism and anti-semitism can arise in areas of strong nationalist identity. ""The Basques share with the Celts the privilege of indulging in unrivaled extravagance on the subject of themselves"" was a quote from 1884 that was included in the book and gave me a bit of a wry laugh. But, like I said, while he does poke fun at the Basque myth, he also believes in it deep down, and why wouldn't he? The story he tells from prehistory to the present day ordinary people he meets while researching show a facinating people, who seem full of contradictions; distrustful of outsiders yet imminently hospitable, taciturn yet full of warmth and always ready to sing, inward looking but also some of the greatest adventurers and seafarers the world has seen, and later pioneering businessmen when capitalism was embryonic. I did buy this book on holiday in Bilbao, so it gets extra goodwill point for that, but as a history book, it's definitely up there with the really good ones I've read. One thing the author deals with really well is (unlike the early Basque nationalists) he doesn't try to create a simple narrative in the evolution of Basque politics. This was unusual for me to read, because historians naturally enough I suppose, like to tell a story which makes sense and has a clear, sensible outcome. This guy is a fisherman more than a historian from what I gather, and he tells the history of the wars and politics of the Basque country with all its twists and turns and strong opposing loyalties in a way that I feel gave me a better appreciation of the seeming contradictions of the modern day Basque political scene that I think an author looking for a clear cut narrative would not have. How did a people and country renowned for being extremely religious come to be a place more palpably leftwing than any place else I've been? Many people in the history of the Basque country were staunchly royalist, and this might seem counter intuitive to a modern politics tourist such as myself. The reasons for all this are clear when you see where the various loyalties the country had got them, or rather didn't get them, in the long centuries that they've been struggling for self determination. The Catholic church, the monarchy, the Carlists, the liberals, the anti-Francoists and even, though it came close, the alliance in WWII - none of them secured the Basques their self determination. In the end gun toting revolutionaries/terrorists (take your pick!) could not do so either. It's hard to know where the struggle goes next. To paraphrase the author in a 100, or maybe even 1000 years, there may not be a France or a Spain, but there will still be Basques. Anyway, the book is also peppered throughout with recipes, which I thought was delightful, and more history writers should take a leaf out of that particular book."
3353,Crystal Clear: A Human-Powered Methodology for Small Teams,Alistair Cockburn,3.97,101,10,Johnny,4,"Some aspects of this book were totally awesome. I love the basic methodology, the focus on communications, personal safety, reflection workshops, importance of keeping methods lightweight, etc. Unfortunately, the book suffers from a bit too much of trying to be something for everybody. Huge swaths of material were skimmable at best for me. For instance, examples of requirements documents and design diagrams. I've seen thousands of such examples and seeing new ones in this context provides nothing for me. Another example: reports relating to ISO certification. Another example: encyclopaedic categorization of all the possible work products, indexed by which team member role is supposed to produce them.One more thing that I find perplexing about this book. The author shows a strong bias against using software tools to manage requirements documents and other work products, manage iterations, etc. I would be a full-on advocate of, for example, using a wiki. It's a searchable storage device on top of being a collaborative documentation tool. I'm constantly going back to old wiki pages and work tickets to look into the details of what was done. This is going to be a royal pain if the only documentation we have are cell phone pictures of what we once drew up on a whiteboard."
8798,Un viejo que leía novelas de amor,Luis Sepúlveda,3.87,8618,616,Mike Puma,4,"Briefly: This compelling and efficient novella grabs readers and quickly embeds them within the life of an aging Ecuadoran whose first, and only love, has died after a brief and unproductive marriage, leaving the much younger Antonio José Bolívar Proaño procreatively unaccomplished, as well as, a failure as a settler in a new community. Unable to return to his previous village, “the poor forgive everything but failure,” Antonio settles in the village of El Idilio (the Idyll—get a sense of how this begins to work?) where his humble life includes joining the hunting expeditions of the Shuar, a people very in touch with the environment and tradition, but try as he does, he remains, ‘like them, but not one of them,’ as an inadvertent violation of tradition and friendship all too quickly reveals. Later in life, he is comforted by visits by a travelling dentist who brings novels—love stories—premised on the recommendations of the dentist’s favored prostitute. The idyllic life of Antonio is complicated by the constantly sweating village mayor (variously referred to as ‘the fat man’ or Slimey Toad) and an unforgiving ocelot. Honor, tradition, wisdom, all themes in a slight volume that readers will breeze through as danger mounts and admiration for the old man grows.You can keep Hemingway’s old man, I’ll take Sepúlveda’s any day. 4-and-some-fraction stars, in this case rounded down, not because of a failure, rather because it could have been so, so much longer. Very nicely done.Nearly forgot a quote:even as he was now preparing to do with the books the dentist had brought him, books that lay beckoning to him from the high table, innocent of the chaotic vista of a past that Antonio José Bolívar preferred to forget, leaving open the wells of memory, to be filled with the delights and torments of loves that outlasted time."
1310,Fire at Eden's Gate: Tom McCall and the Oregon Story,Brent Walth,4.36,90,18,Kristin,5,"Fascinating story, well researched, of Oregon's Governor Tom McCall, who put Oregon on the map as an innovator in public policy during his term (1967-1975). Oregon probably isn't on many Americans' mental maps. It has a small population and a lot more trees than people. But in the 60s, it had pollution from paper mills, an influx of residents, and development pressure on its long coast line. During Tom McCall's term, Oregon established public ownership of the beaches, the nation's first bottle bill, water pollution measures, and established urban growth boundaries to limit sprawl. Tom McCall took a bold stand that he didn't want new businesses and jobs if those jobs would hurt Oregon's natural environment. A highlight of the book is the story of Tom McCall's grandparents. One grandfather was an impulsive copper baron, risen from poverty to ridiculous wealth to poverty again. He was dedicated to fantasy of adventure - gambling and building castles with his fortune. The two castles he built were called Dreamwold and Westernwold. His other grandfather was a serious Massachusetts governor and scholar. Tom was a mix of these two extreme personalities: a hard drinking, gambling, socializing, scholar, politician and concerned journalist. Another interesting book the story tells is about the time when Tom McCall was convinced to host the Vortex music festival, the only government sponsored Woodstock-like festival ever in order to avert a riot in downtown Portland.I'm not sure how much non-Oregonians would care about this book, but I loved it and admire all the research and work that went into crafting a five star book."
1308,Gates of Fire: An Epic Novel of the Battle of Thermopylae,Steven Pressfield,4.4,21381,1583,Randy,5," Gates of Fire is one of my favorite books...ever. I first read it back when I was in the Marine Corps. It was on the Commandant’s Reading List for a time - required reading for any motivated teufelhund. The author himself is a former Marine, and draws upon his experiences to create a compellingly insightful look at the mental and psychological makeup of a soldier. The concepts of self-sacrifice, service, community, camaraderie, and duty are the thematic core of this historic novel.  Steven Pressfield does more than just tell the story of what happened during the battle of Thermopylae (which in and of itself is a phenomenal story), he uses it as a backdrop for studying the psychological makeup of what a soldier should be. There is more philosophy in this book than one would expect from a war novel, but this is why I consider it both insightful, and at times inspiring…even after the fifth read. This is a great book for anyone who is thinking of, or soon will be joining military service. Anyone wishing to gain insight on how a military is supposed to function should read this book. Anyone wishing insight to the mind of a soldier should read this book. Those who are confused as to why a friend or loved one wants to join the military can very likely gain their answers from this book."

1307,"Fire Sea (The Death Gate Cycle, #3)",Margaret Weis,4.05,15682,184,Bill,4,"Fire Sea is the third and darkest installment in the series, and thebest so far. A few more revelations are revealed about the Sartans, therace who had sundered these worlds, but of course I can't tell you thosewithout spoiling the story.Suffice it to say, if you liked the first two of the series, you're really going to like this one.There is more development to Haplo's and Alfred's characters, as they are once again thrown together and are forced to put aside ancient hatred (well, Haplo anyways) to get out of another mess alive. Weis & Hickman sure know how to spin a yarn. I love their plot developments, and I'm getting quite attached to these characters.Great series, and I'll be right back into it for the fourth world aftera few more books."
1309,"Memory of Fire (The World Gates, #1)",Holly Lisle,3.64,479,28,Wendy,1,"I'm convinced I was sold on this book because of the galloping horse and rider on the cover. I'd heard of Holly Lisle and wanted to try one of her books. Perhaps I shouldn't have started with this one. One of my problems is that I try to convince myself that I enjoy the fantasy/sci fi genre, but lately I've felt disappointed with everything in that genre--short of LOTR, Dune and Ender's Game--that I've picked up.The story concept had promise. Molly, a young woman in Cat Creek, NC is kidnapped from her bed into another world where she discovers she has magical healing powers. Lauren, another woman from her same town, discovers she can create bridges between worlds. What neither of them realize is that the use of magic is having dire effects on Earth (interesting idea!) The plot gets wrapped around the Cat Creek Sentinels--seemingly ""average"" citizens who guard the magical portals--as they track the source of a mysterious flu that threatens to wipe out the world. If only I could have distinguished between the 8+ different Sentinels, then perhaps later revelations about them would have been more dramatic. Perhaps if the ""bad guys"" had actually been fleshed out with motivations/characteristics/physical descriptions--anything!--I would have cared more. In fact, besides Lauren, Molly, and June Bug, i really didn't care about anyone else. In the other world Oria the leader of a humanoid race of elf-like people (that's my best guess, anyway) develops a very bland and unwarrented romance with one of the humans, but the relationship seemed so flimsy that I could only laugh when I read about it. I also disliked the style. None of the dialogue sounds less like actual people talking than characters on an after school special. Characters are constantly explaining ""duh"" things in far more words than a normal person would. Description is mundane and forced. Don't bother unless you love the fantasy genre."

3711,White Teeth,Zadie Smith,3.75,92031,5463,Ben,3,"White Teeth is an expansive, detailed, and beautifully written attempt to encapsulate the social chaos that blossoms at the bridging of generational, national and sexual mindsets. It reminds me very much of the freeflowing histories written by Marquez and Allende, as well as Salman Rushdie's strange little one-off treatise on cultural alienation, Fury. (Samad, in particular, reminds me quite a bit of Fury's Malik Solanka.)The book does many things well. Smith has a serious ear for dialogue and accent, she knows how to manage the flow and pacing of a story, and she's quite skilled at employing large concepts (genetic manipulation, immigrant psychology, the concept of history itself) both as fact and as metaphor. Her cast of characters is varied and nearly every one of them comes off as a fully flesh and blood human being. However, it's in terms of these personalities that I feel she makes her biggest misstep.Zadie Smith is what I'd call an Ironist. I don't mean this in the Mark Twain, Kurt Vonnegut, Jon Stewart sense. I don't mean that she's a comedian. I mean it in the sense that the territory she stands on--that her narrator in White Teeth stands on--is one whose boundaries are staked out in terms of what she is not. My friend Brandon commented below that Smith shows ""blatant contempt for every character except the one who is clearly based on the author."" While I understand where he's coming from, I don't think it's contempt per se. On the contrary, I think Smith has deep feelings for most of her characters--even the more despicable ones like Crispin and Millat. I think that what Brandon interprets as contempt is something far more ambiguous: let's call it detached superiority.The Ironist defines herself through the process of over-defining others. Every character in this novel is over-defined, over-drawn. While this provides us with a great, at times excruciating level of detail, it also paints each of them into a kind of cage wherein all of their actions are predictable. Each of them has a sort of ""final vocabulary"" (cf. Rorty) that defines the limits of what they might do or say--the doctrines of Islam and the Watchtower Society, of PETA or clinical science. In the worst cases, their adherence to these vocabularies allows Smith to slip them into easy ""types"" (see: Mr. Topps, Crispin, Joshua, Marcus, the various members of FATE). Smith creates her authorial/narrative identity--what's called a metastable personality--by passively proving that she is not limited by such a final vocabulary, and that in escaping their confines she has a broader, more comprehensive view of the social workings of the world. This is, generally speaking, the goal of any omniscient narrator, but the way that Smith goes about writing this one in particular imparts a certain sense of smugness (the parenthetical asides to the reader, the knowing winks, the jokes at the expense of easy targets) that isn't always present.The metastable personality is the natural reaction to uncomfortability with final vocabularies, but it itself is of course just as self-defining as any of them (albeit in the opposite direction). It instinctually yearns for instability, but prefers to admire chaos from afar rather than living in it. The metastable personality knows that in order to maintain coherence it must remain stable, and that the only way to remain stable is to balance itself on the disbelief of all known final vocabularies. Smith writes off worldview after worldview, but is of course unable to articulate her own because her own is simply the absence of adherence to any such worldview.This isn't so much a criticism of Smith's work as it is an explanation of why it is the way it is, and why it can be read as contempt."
3718,Stranger Than Fiction: True Stories,Chuck Palahniuk,3.56,20287,766,Lyn,3,"I have often said there is no reason to read fiction as life is far stranger and more interesting and it is this premise that leads award winning and best selling author Chuck Palahniuk to write this compilation of real life oddities and bizarre observations.

(Samad, in particular, reminds me quite a bit of Fury's Malik Solanka.)The book does many things well. Smith has a serious ear for dialogue and accent, she knows how to manage the flow and pacing of a story, and she's quite skilled at employing large concepts (genetic manipulation, immigrant psychology, the concept of history itself) both as fact and as metaphor. Her cast of characters is varied and nearly every one of them comes off as a fully flesh and blood human being. However, it's in terms of these personalities that I feel she makes her biggest misstep.Zadie Smith is what I'd call an Ironist. I don't mean this in the Mark Twain, Kurt Vonnegut, Jon Stewart sense. I don't mean that she's a comedian. I mean it in the sense that the territory she stands on--that her narrator in White Teeth stands on--is one whose boundaries are staked out in terms of what she is not. My friend Brandon commented below that Smith shows ""blatant contempt for every character except the one who is clearly based on the author."" While I understand where he's coming from, I don't think it's contempt per se. On the contrary, I think Smith has deep feelings for most of her characters--even the more despicable ones like Crispin and Millat. I think that what Brandon interprets as contempt is something far more ambiguous: let's call it detached superiority.The Ironist defines herself through the process of over-defining others. Every character in this novel is over-defined, over-drawn. While this provides us with a great, at times excruciating level of detail, it also paints each of them into a kind of cage wherein all of their actions are predictable. Each of them has a sort of ""final vocabulary"" (cf. Rorty) that defines the limits of what they might do or say--the doctrines of Islam and the Watchtower Society, of PETA or clinical science. In the worst cases, their adherence to these vocabularies allows Smith to slip them into easy ""types"" (see: Mr. Topps, Crispin, Joshua, Marcus, the various members of FATE). Smith creates her authorial/narrative identity--what's called a metastable personality--by passively proving that she is not limited by such a final vocabulary, and that in escaping their confines she has a broader, more comprehensive view of the social workings of the world. This is, generally speaking, the goal of any omniscient narrator, but the way that Smith goes about writing this one in particular imparts a certain sense of smugness (the parenthetical asides to the reader, the knowing winks, the jokes at the expense of easy targets) that isn't always present.The metastable personality is the natural reaction to uncomfortability with final vocabularies, but it itself is of course just as self-defining as any of them (albeit in the opposite direction). It instinctually yearns for instability, but prefers to admire chaos from afar rather than living in it. The metastable personality knows that in order to maintain coherence it must remain stable, and that the only way to remain stable is to balance itself on the disbelief of all known final vocabularies. Smith writes off worldview after worldview, but is of course unable to articulate her own because her own is simply the absence of adherence to any such worldview.This isn't so much a criticism of Smith's work as it is an explanation of why it is the way it is, and why it can be read as contempt."
3715,Autograph Man (cd),Zadie Smith,3.14,9558,647,B the BookAddict,5,"One of those serendipitous moments for me: looking for another of Zadie Smith's books NW,, I chanced upon this one. What a find. It did take me a couple of pages to settle in with this story but I was hooked from then on. A novel about a young man, his friends and a few months in their lives shown deftly in the hilarious, droll, sometimes very serious but always brilliant words of Zadie Smith.Alex-Li Tandem is half Chinese, is Jewish, has a black girlfriend, a best mate who's a Rabbi and another one who (view spoiler)[is secretly in love with him (hide spoiler)]. He's writing his own book on the differences between Jewish and Goyish and he's an Autograph Man – he buys and sells autographs of famous people. His father died when he was fifteen and now at twenty-seven, it's coming up for his father's shul to be offered on his anniversary; something Alex has always failed to do so far. He has had a lifetime devotion to a famous 1940s movie-star but has never managed to acquire her autograph. Alex has always felt himself to be something of a failure but life is about to deal him some hands he never thought possible.Loved it, loved it, loved it. The humor is sly and the descriptions have be Smith's own kind of wonderful. It is sassy and philosophical, it's warm-hearted and funny, it's wise and irreverent. I borrowed a copy from the library but I'm about to purchase one for myself. One of the best reads I've had this year. 5★"

4162,Read for Your Life: 11 Ways to Better Yourself Through Books,Pat Williams,3.7,79,18,Jeff,4,"It's hard to decide what I think about this book. At times I found it very repetitive and not that well laid out. At times it was simply stating the obvious. Yet I came away from reading it more determined to make reading more and more a part of my life, and, more importantly, to encourage others to do the same -- which was really the point of this book. Filled with dozens of inspirational quotes, reading suggestions, and speed reading tips. Lots of quotes from academics and some surprising statistics (95% of Americans have never entered a bookstore!). When I picked up the book, I thought (and he mentioned this in the preface) that it was an odd book, in that those who would read it don't need to be convinced of the importance of reading (preaching to the choir) and those who would need to hear it's message wouldn't be inclined to read it. All in all, it was a worthwhile book, and in some ways life-changing. As a Christian, I really liked how he was able to incorporate opinions from people of faith without coming across as preachy!"
7021,"To Be a King (Guardians of Ga'Hoole, #11)",Kathryn Lasky,4.03,4430,68,King Hoole,5,"Wonderful. It is the conclusion of the legends. Hoole must now mass an army of all types of creatures to defeat this nachtmagen (evil magic) once in for all. It is very inspirational, heroic, adventurous and of course, sad. But that's the nature of war. What I really like is the strength of the characters. Particularly Hoole and his mother Queen Siv. In fact I adore Siv. I love how Hoole talks about its not magic makes us powerful and strong. No magic is REALLY good. Our strength is rooted in earthly values like goodness, equality, and nobility of deed. He has the kind of personality that if everyone were like him, the world would be a better place. And Siv, oh Siv. She is truly a noble owl like no other. She is strong. She saw her own mate get killed and knew she must right things. She is a powerful female character. Grank even expresses that he believes he has met only one owl with ga', (great spirit) Siv. She protects the ice palace for as long as she can, she gives up her only son for his safety, she attempts to battle Lord Arrin forever crippling one wing, and she resists the horrible crippling yellow light that floods from the eyes of hagsfiends twice. The last time giving up her own life to save her son's. I tip my hat to her."
3771,The Portable Jack Kerouac,Jack Kerouac,4.09,829,22,Rodney,4,"To be honest, I had already read about 80% of what is in this selection, as I was a big Kerouac fan in my teens and early 20s (and still am, really) and devoured all I could find of his. I mostly bought this because it includes a nice selection of his letters. I flipped through the two volume collection of his letters in a used bookstore once and I just couldn't see how even a serious Kerouac fan would devote so much time to reading through all the riff raff of his casual communications to get to the meat of it all. The Portable does all the ""dirty work"" for us and includes only the most historically significant letters, or at least the most enjoyable reads for Kerouac fans.The selection of rare and/or posthumous works is also really good. From what I scanned of the selections of his published works, nearly all the best stuff seems to be in there as well. The Portable follows his life and career chronologically, which stays true to Kerouac’s own Proustian ideas for his bio-fictional catalogue.Ann Charters edited this, so I know it is a great intro to, as well as summary of, Kerouac's work and its enduring impact on American letters over the past sixty years. But even for the well-read Kerouac fan, this is a nice, concise collection to own for such Kerouac-friendly occasions as long roadtrips and camping."
3772,Big Sur,Jack Kerouac,3.86,23594,882,Joshua Boydstun,4,"Kerouac is a paradox. He's simultaneously over-rated and under-rated. His worst books (particularly On the Road) are iconic and uncritically adored by teenagers and hippy-dippy morons, while his best works are overlooked.Big Sur ranks among his best. It's Kerouac at his lowest, having been devoured by fame and digested by the vast chasm that lies between the saint he's imagined to be and the bitter, depressed, exiled, alcoholic that he really is.Kerouac is astoundingly frank in describing his desperate attempt to deal with what he's become and to somehow reconnect with the wonder that inspired him a mere decade earlier. It's a picture of a man at odds with his iconic status. It's in direct opposition to so much of his early work that sees holiness and bliss lurking everywhere, including the gutter. And the ending, an onamonapoetic ode to the roaring coast of Big Sur, is a vision of destruction and restoration rolled into one."

Even before I was shown the meaning of life in a dream at 17 (then promptly forgot it because I thought I smelled pancakes), I knew this to be true--and yet, I have always felt a need to search for the truth, that nebulous, ill-treated creature. Adams has always been, to me, to be a welcome companion in that journey. Between the search for meaning and the recognition that it's all a joke in poor taste lies Douglas Adams, and, luckily for us, he doesn't seem to mind if you lie there with him. He's a tall guy, but he'll make room.For all his crazed unpredictability, Adams is a powerful rationalist. His humor comes from his attempts to really think through all the things we take for granted. It turns out it takes little more than a moment's questioning to burst our preconceptions at the seams, yet rarely does this stop us from treating the most ludicrous things as if they were perfectly reasonable.It is no surprise that famed atheist Richard Dawkins found a friend and ally in Adams. What is surprising is that people often fail to see the rather consistent and reasonable philosophy laid out by Adams' quips and absurdities. His approach is much more personable (and less embittered) than Dawkins', which is why I think of Adams as a better face for rational materialism (which is a polite was of saying 'atheism').Reading his books, it's not hard to see that Dawkins is tired of arguing with uninformed idiots who can't even recognize when a point has actually been made. Adams' humanism, however, stretched much further than the contention between those who believe, and those who don't.We see it from his protagonists, who are not elitist intellectuals--they're not even especially bright--but damn it, they're trying. By showing a universe that makes no sense and having his characters constantly question it, Adams is subtly hinting that this is the natural human state, and the fact that we laugh and sympathize shows that it must be true.It's all a joke, it's all ridiculous. The absurdists might find this depressing, but they're just a bunch of narcissists, anyhow. Demnading the world make sense and give you purpose is rather self centered when it already contains toasted paninis, attractive people in bathing suits, and Euler's Identity.

5306,Travels with Charley: In Search of America,John Steinbeck,4.07,52715,3825,Jeffrey Keeten,4,"“I saw in their eyes something I was to see over and over in every part of the nation- a burning desire to go, to move, to get under way, anyplace, away from any HERE. They spoke quietly of how they wanted to go someday, to move about, free and unanchored, not toward something but away from something. I saw this look and heard this yearning everywhere in every states I visited. Nearly every American hungers to move.” The steed...Rocinante!John Steinbeck was not feeling very well before he decided to take a trip across country. It wasn’t only physical, but also a general malaise about the condition of the country and his own place in it. Early in the book he makes a statement that reveals exactly his state of mind. The words betray a clairvoyance of a near future that would catch up with him in 1968. “I have always lived violently, drunk hugely, eaten too much or not at all, slept around the clock or missed two nights of sleeping, worked too hard and too long in glory, or slobbed for a time in utter laziness. I've lifted, pulled, chopped, climbed, made love with joy and taken my hangovers as a consequence, not as a punishment.”Okay, that is the life philosophy that he has tried to live by, but it is what he says next that shows that he is feeling the tight grip of his impending demise. ”My wife married a man; I saw no reason why she should inherit a baby. I knew that ten or twelve thousand miles driving a truck, alone and unattended, over every kind of road, would be hard work, but to me it represented the antidote for the poison of the professional sick man. And in my own life I am not willing to trade quality for quantity. If this projected journey should prove too much then it was time to go anyway. I see too many men delay their exits with a sickly, slow reluctance to leave the stage. It’s bad theater as well as bad living. I am very fortunate in having a wife who likes being a woman, which means that she likes men, not elderly babies. Although this last foundation for the journey was never discussed I am sure she understood it.”  Steinbeck lighting up the coffin nails that would eventually kill him with the wife he had a hard time leaving behind.So he is on a heroic quest. He even found the loyal steed to carry him from place to place. He named her Rocinante after the horse in Don Quixote as if he’d already decided before starting that for most of the journey he was going to be tilting at windmills. Bill Steigerwald, former journalist, in 2010 decided to unravel the murky, twisting road of Steinbeck’s trip by following in his tire tracks. Instead of a GMC pickup, specially made with a deluxe cabin, Steigerwald took his Toyota Rav4 and slept in Walmart parking lots and used car lots. His goal was to try to part the curtain of pure mythology and actually determine where and what Steinbeck did. There are discrepancies. There are holes in Steinbeck’s...lets call it a tale...so large that you could have driven Rocinante pulling the Empire State building through these gaps and still had clearance on both sides. Bill Barich wrote in his book “Long Way Home: On the Trail of Steinbeck’s America”.“Steinbeck was extremely depressed, in really bad health, and was discouraged by everyone from making the trip. He was trying to recapture his youth, the spirit of the knight-errant. But at that point he was probably incapable of interviewing ordinary people. He’d become a celebrity and was more interested in talking to Dag Hammarskjold and Adlai Stevenson.”So the thinking is, that instead of this solo trip where he has cut all ties to the comforts of his life and is out among the people pressing the flesh and writing down his observations of real America, that Travels with Charley is actually a tall tale. The truth is, for most of the trip, he was in luxury hotels, motels, and only camping in Rocinante occasionally. The writing, well crap, he is a novelist. He was not spinning most of it out of whole cloth, but pretty close. The original manuscript, I’m told, has his wife Elaine as a companion through much more of the trip than what he admits in the book. In the story he has her flying out to Chicago as an emergency care package dropping in to give solace to the weary traveler. I do find it sweet how attached to his wife he is. He had a hard time leaving her and I’m sure at some point the decision was made that if this trip is going to be any kind of success at all that he needed the care and comfort of his wife along the way. The book doesn’t have the same ring to it as Travels with Charley and Elaine. But let’s talk about Charley. ”...I took one companion on my journey--an old French gentleman poodle known as Charley. Actually his name is Charles le Chien. He was born in Bercy on the outskirts of Paris and trained in France, and while he knows a little poodle-English, he responds quickly only to commands in French. Otherwise he has to translate, and that slows him down. He is a very big poodle, of a color called bleu, and he is blue when he is clean. Charley is a born diplomat. He prefers negotiation to fighting, and properly so, since he is very bad at fighting.”
  Charles le Chien and the author.We learn that Charley has crooked front teeth that he makes a Ptth sound through whenever he requires Steinbeck’s attention or as a form of general commentary on the state of affairs. He mutters to himself when agitated and he does have a prostate issue on the trip that required emergency veterinarian help. Unexpected he turns into a demon dog when he catches a whiff of bear in Yellowstone. As Steinbeck refers to him as his suddenly ”Jekyll Headed Dog”. He proves to be a source of comfort to Steinbeck when the blues, which were never far away, would descend upon him. “A sad soul can kill you quicker, far quicker, than a germ.”The most depressing moment in the trip is when Steinbeck stops in New Orleans to go see “the cheerleaders” and to experience first hand the hatred that was blooming over desegregation of schools. ”These blowzy women with their little hats and their clippings hungered for attention. They wanted to be admired. They simpered in happy, almost innocent triumph when they were applauded. Theirs was the demented cruelty of egocentric children, and somehow this made their insensate beastliness much more heartbreaking. These were not mothers, not even women. They were crazy actors playing to a crazy audience.”These were young, white working mothers who every day stood in front of the schools and screamed the most ”bestial and filthy and degenerate” words at little black girls trying to go to school. 
  Ruby Bridges, one of four little black girls that had to be escorted to school by U.S. Marshalls.Most white parents pulled their kids out of the schools, but those brave souls that tried to take their kids to school were met with the same vile language and threats. Soon the black girls were the only ones in the two schools. It makes me nauseous every time I see footage from this event. One of my favorite parts of the book was Steinbeck’s time among the Redwoods. “The redwoods, once seen, leave a mark or create a vision that stays with you always. No one has ever successfully painted or photographed a redwood tree. The feeling they produce is not transferable. From them comes silence and awe. It's not only their unbelievable stature, nor the color which seems to shift and vary under your eyes, no, they are not like any trees we know, they are ambassadors from another time.” 
  If you have never seen them make sure that on any trip to California that you take the time to go walk among giants. These trees are over a thousand years old and over 95% of the original old growth have been logged for their excellent timber. They are the oldest living things on the planet. How baffling it must be to entities, that are time capsules of the activities of the planet, to find themselves being destroyed by these ants on the surface of the earth who with bits of sharp steel can wipe out a 1,000 years of life within moments. It shakes the soul to contemplate. So let us believe that most of this book is fabrication, that Steinbeck poured himself a cup of coffee liberally laced with Applejack and typed up a series of events that never quite happened. He could throw in a few observations about an America that he didn’t have to stray far from home to determine. “American cities are like badger holes, ringed with trash--all of them--surrounded by piles of wrecked and rusting automobiles, and almost smothered in rubbish. Everything we use comes in boxes, cartons, bins, the so-called packaging we love so much. The mountain of things we throw away are much greater than the things we use.” He could disguise his guile with such pithy remarks as:”...I cannot commend this account as an America that you will find. So much there is to see, but our morning eyes describe a different world than do our afternoon eyes, and surely our wearied evening eyes can report only a weary evening world.”I’ve taken trips with people that when we arrive back home you would think from comparing their memories to mine that we went to the same place, but possibly in a parallel universe. I feel the same way sometimes when I read a review of a person who read a book I liked. I feel as if we had read two different books. It is because we did. My view of life is different from everyone else’s and so is yours. We have different experiences. We bring those experiences to traveling, to reading, to conversations, and the whole kaleidoscope of it all colors our memories. Regardless of the level of truth that this book represents I was able to spend 246 pages with the man John Steinbeck. No biographer can ignore the personal philosophies that sprinkle the pages of this book. This is a weary soul that still occasionally finds moments of brightness. He is not a note taker, because he confessed he generally loses them anyway. He lets what he sees percolate through the stratosphere to the core of his brain until the purest of thoughts lands on his tongue. Some of his “observations” were gems, some feel wooden and maybe needed the deft touch of a healthier man. I took his journey, maybe not the physical one he presents, but the journey of the mind of a writer trying to share a few last thoughts with the readers he felt destined to lose.If you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visit http://www.jeffreykeeten.comI also have a Facebook blogger page at:https://www.facebook.com/JeffreyKeeten"
5304,De Profundis and Other Writings,Oscar Wilde,4.21,2262,101,Bill  Kerwin,5,"A superb work of prose, this autobiographical essay in epistolary form is also--although Wilde would never call it so--an unconventional moral exhortation and an impressionistic work of Christology. This letter from prison written to Lord Alfred ""Bosie"" Douglas--Wilde's young lover and the occasion of his downfall--urges the young lord to face up to his own reckless past behavior and to seek the knowledge of self that can only be gained through suffering. ""Shallowness is the only sin."" Wilde repeats again and again. ""Whatever is realized is right."" What Wilde calls ""a failure of the imagination"" is the moral evil that afflicts Bosie, and it is only by a necessarily painful growth in self-awareness that this young man can become a fully human, completely realized work of art. Some of the most interesting passages here are Wilde's exploration of the nature of Christ. Wilde considers Him the true founder of the Romantic movement, the first authentic individualist, a man who saw each person as unique and who revealed to humankind the profound truth that we must grow through suffering into love."

OK now that I got that out of the way, I can talk about Prowlers.This is the 4th and final installment of this series. There was more action, more emotion, and more brutality that the first three volumes. Even though this can still be called a Young Adult title, things get pretty intense and almost reach full tilt horror novel status.I wish that Golden had continued this series as well as the connected ""Jenna Blake"" series. The ending here even hints at more to come, but it has been 12 years with no more.Werewolf fans and YA horror readers will enjoy this book and the rest of the series immensely."

I kept hoping the romance subplot would at least be fun and sexy but it was a disappointment too. The protagonist, over the first few chapters, becomes more and more unlikable. She constantly victimizes herself and I found it quite annoying. I don't even think divorced, single moms would necessarily sympathize all that much with this character. The supporting characters are flat and do little to develop the main characters. A few characters were quirky and entertaining but not enough to save this book from a one star rating."

It is one of the earliest books I vividly remember reading aloud to myself, and I remember the first time my mother read it to me before she put me to bed. Here's the gist of the plot: A little boy named Max dresses up in a wolf costume, plays with a hammer, chases his dog with a fork, then threatens to cannibalize his mother. His mother, a master of irony, then puts him to bed with no dinner. Already, this story should start creeping you out. Then a forest starts to grow in Max's bedroom. And no, no chemicals have been ingested anywhere in the story. Though the bit about chasing the dog with the fork does imply a delusional state. Regardless, a fucking forest grows in the kids bedroom. So naturally he gets in a boat and sails off to the other side of the world, to where all these ""wild things"" are. And promptly subjugates everyone he sees. I'm a damn toddler, and my mom is reading me a book about a sociopath. So Max has a ball with this gang he's conquered and converted, and they howl at the moon and hop through trees. Then he gets hungry and goes home, where his mother, no doubt terrified of his new army of foreign creatures, has left his food for him, still warm. I thought, ""This woman aims to do me harm."" Yes, please, mother. Read me a story about my bedroom becoming a forest inhabited by monsters, then put me to bed. Think I slept that night? No, I hid out under my bed with a plastic baseball bat, a water gun and flashlight, hoping to God that if this was the night it all went wrong, I had the courage to look those monsters in the eye and pretend I wasn't wetting myself. I made a nest with a giant teddy bear and two pillows and didn't come out until the next morning, when I heard my mom coming down the hall. All day long I pretended nothing was different. But I asked her to read me Where The Wild Things Are again that night. And the next night. For months. I would ask her questions like ""Do you think I will have my monsters get you if you don't make me supper?"" And she'd smile, and say ""Go to bed, Nathan."" Spooky shit, I'm telling you. I learned to read through fear and intimidation. A subversive masterpiece. NC"
205,"A Long Shadow (Inspector Ian Rutledge, #8)",Charles Todd,4.1,2929,214,Joanne,4,"Ian Rutledge breaks my heart. On the surface, he's an upper class British officer returned from the front after WWI to resume his position as an inspector at Scotland Yard. Underneath the handsome facade, he is the ultimate casualty of a terrible war-- tortured by his memories, haunted by a decision made in the heat of battle and abandoned by his fiancée, he throws himself full force into solving the cases he's assigned. Instead of a partner or a sidekick, Rutledge has only the ghostly specter of a dead colleague and brother-in-arms, Hamish McCleod, to help him sort out the details. Smart and original."
3725,Hidden Persuaders,Vance Packard,3.91,763,58,Alan,3,"This slim volume, already more than half a century old, remains readable and relevant today, despite largely preaching to the converted about a war that's already been lost.Its thesis is simple: sometime before the midpoint of the 20th Century, American advertisers began appropriating techniques from the burgeoning fields of psychology and sociology to manipulate us as consumers of goods and services, religions and politics, to a great extent without our knowledge or consent. The effects of such manipulation were already pervasive and insidious even at the time Packard was writing, and have only grown more so since.Packard makes a good case, filled with telling anecdotes drawn from trade magazines and interviews with advertising industry insiders. The Hidden Persuaders is written in a clear, accessible prose style—assertive, but not at all rigorous. A Wikipedian would constantly be crying ""citation needed""—as the introduction to this 50th-anniversary edition by Mark Crispin Miller mentions, this book is devoid of footnotes, endnotes and bibliography. It's a polemic, intended to awaken the hypnotized masses, not a scholarly analysis with an audience of several dozen.Unfortunately, the edition I read was also abysmally proofread; I believe it might have been scanned and OCR'd (run through optical character recognition software), and possibly spell-checked, from the types of error that remained... but surely no human proofreader of any competence would have missed so many mistakes, especially late in the book. Page 144, for one example, uses ""church"" for ""churn,"" and the phrase ""a large number women"" is missing its ""of."" Page 205 coins the odd portmanteau word ""fundraiobably"" (for ""fundraisers probably,"" I'm sure), and on page 201, the phrase ""pubic-relations men"" actually puts in an appearance! I but skim the surface of the solecisms in this edition... if this is the kind of thing that grates on you, you may wish to seek out an earlier release of this work.The Hidden Persuaders was enormously persuasive in its time... it's sold millions of copies since its original publication. Yet I found Packard's perspective severely dated, almost a time capsule of the 1950s in America. I found myself wondering, What Would Packard Buy—what were his brand loyalties? There's little hint of them in the case he makes; he skewers the very idea of the consumer culture liberally, but without bringing any personal perspective into the argument. I wondered whether Packard was himself a cigarette smoker; his repeated dismissive references to ""the lung cancer scare"" began to sound a little defensive after awhile. And then there's the constant gender stereotyping... the distinction between what aimless ""housewives"" want to buy, now that they're bereft of purpose due to their labor-saving devices, and the expensive objects their breadwinning husbands bring home, is simply accepted, both by Packard and by the sources of his information.In other places, though, it must be said that Packard's observations seem as deadly accurate as ever; our national obsession with the size of our automobiles has only recently shown signs of abating, for example, and his jaundiced view of the packaging of politicians makes even more sense now than when our leaders were still innocently deciding what color their televised chairs should be and whether the President's eyeglasses made him look too pale.At the end of the day, and despite its significant flaws when looked at through modern eyes, The Hidden Persuaders is still a landmark analysis, and it's still fun to read."
2854,Truth Decay: Defending Christianity Against the Challenges of Postmodernism,Douglas R. Groothuis,3.86,157,14,Lysergius,3,"Despite the inherent assumption that the measure of truth is the Christian Faith and the Bible, Groothuis launches a convincing attack on the more ludicrous aspect of Postmodernism. Correctly identifying the key aspects of this new ""faith"" he debunks each nonsensical relativistic viewpoint, culminating in his final chapter in a total destruction of the idiocies of the televisual world most adults inhabit.While it is hard as an atheist to accept his definition of truth as gospel and scripture, it is clear that the very concept of ""truth"" is under attack. That endless unconnected images and ideas, based on nothing but vested interests threaten to sweep away the last vestiges of critical thought. That the demise of reading, of words in favour of imagery will mark the decline of rational man, to be replaced by a total entertainment cosmos, and awful prospect. "
4961,"Good Night, Princess Pruney Toes",Lisa McCourt,4.2,70,14,Dolly,5,"We first found this on Tumblebooks and our girls just loved it. They wanted to hear it over and over again. They just couldn't get enough of it. One of our absolute favorites...December 2015 update: I borrowed the hardcover edition from the library to share with my visiting brother-in-law and his two-year-old daughter. I had hoped that they would fall in love with this tale as much as we did. After rereading the story, I was a tiny bit disappointed. The book just doesn't hold a candle to the narrated, almost animated Tumblebooks version. It's still a wonderful tale about a father-daughter bond, but I like the online version much, much better."
4958,You Shall Know Our Velocity,Dave Eggers,3.62,25596,1564,Greg,4,"Preface to the fourth edition:I wrote this a few years ago, back when I had just finished reading the book, but before I had died. I still haven't died so that's beside the point. I'm procrastinating right now, and copying this from another site where this originally appeared.Original PrefaceThere are three ways that I pick out books to read. One is through the convoluted and serpentine way that I choose most of my books. The second way is by catchy covers promising pop-culture hipness. This second of choosing books I have begun to wean myself off of since too many times I have been burned on the choices. One book in particular that I choose in this manner was Dave Eggers A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius. I’m one of the few people of my demographic that hated this book and felted cheated (or of the few I’ve run into (4th edition note, this is not so true anymore)). I thought the idea of Dave Eggers was great, I respected his journal McSweeny’s and sometimes thought his quasi-punk rock ethics were commendable. I just didn’t like the book though (I have to stop here about A.H.W.O.S.G., if I get started on this book I’ll just rant on and on—one note though from here on out I will refer to Egger’s first book simply as the first book. Following this brilliantly simple shorthand I will call his second book, You Shall Know Our Velocity!, the second book. I will do this for two reasons. One, because I am not the kind of writer in the Wallace, Moody and Eggers school who enjoys keeping track of long acronyms; but more importantly because I can never really keep straight the titles of Eggers books.). A short aside in the form of a list of titles I have mistakenly (consciously and unconsciously) called both of his books while at work to co-workers and customers A Staggering Work of Heartbreak, You Will Know our Velocity, You Will know us by the Trail of our Velocity, A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Pretensions, That Something book about Genius and Death, The Book without the Cover…. (Authors note: this sounded like a much better idea at the time. Much like the time when I made up a write off, in order to try to get more hits. I then realized it was stupid and I changed the write off. Four days later I cancelled the write off. The moral of this story could be that I don’t like erasing things once they are written. A second moral could be that I really should edit my work better). A second aside in the form of a continuation needed to wrap up the Introduction The third manner I choose my books is with a masochistic zeal to read new books by authors who I disliked to the point to ranting continually about them for weeks in order to a) confirm my suspicions, or b) make me look like an open minded kind of person who can re-encounter a previously disliked author and find enjoyment in their work. Of course when I choose a book for this reason I’m really hoping for A. I don’t go in with an open mind, because I’m an opinionated jerk. I picked up Eggers second book for this third reason. I wanted it to get my goat, and allow me to say, “See I told you.” Second Preface to the ReviewI’m not the kind of author who would write a second, third or possibly even fourth preface to a review. I need to clear up some points made in the introduction.1. I will be the first to admit that I didn’t need to give three ways I pick books. I know full well that I never actually explained the first manner of choice. But see I just pointed out the fault so don’t blame me for it. I know that I was wrong.2. Everything coming before this note has been extraneous and probably best skimmed over. Since you couldn’t have known this till you got to this point in the review you could a) consider yourself noted; b) not blame me, I pointed out in an overtly self-reflexive manner my shortcoming, a la beating everyone to the criticism punch, c) inform your friends of the gratuitousness of the review and tell them to skip through the beginning.3. I must point out once again that I am not the kind of writer who would ramble on and on in this manner.4. I’ll be the first to admit that really only 26% of this review is worth reading. The rest of the review is best skipped over. Again, I warned you so it’s all out of my hands. An Addition to Third Edition of this ReviewSurprisingly it has come to my attention that I have been paid for this review. Of course, that means I need to make a full disclosure of the monies received and the manner in which I will / have spend / spent them.Amount Paid to Date: $0.02Amount of Time (Roughly) Spent Reading the book to base a review on it: 7 hours.Amount of Time Spent Writing the Review, including revisions: 3 Hours.Amount Paid per Hour for Review: $0.002Amount Spent of Royalties: None, I will not receive any money for the review for quite a long time (I never received the money, they took it away from me because I stopped putting up reviews for too long 4th edition note)I feel more than a little guilty at the staggering two tenths of a penny per hour (or 2 thousandths of a dollar) I received for this. When the money comes to me I will be sure to split it up among worthy causes and make a full disclosure of how the money was spent. I imagine it will be used as two percent of the cost of a large cup of coffee at the deli around the corner from where I work.Graphical illustration of profit.Time Spent for review.**********Money Received(can't make something that small here)Cost of Cup of Coffee********* ****************** ************ ******************* ************ ******************** *********Royalties Spent towards this Staggeringly expensive Purchase of Heartbreaking proportions.** The ReviewWhat is the Book AboutWell I can’t tell you. Sorry. (I cut a bunch of words here because I was over in the character count. I rant about people giving away the plot of books, but will keep a movie plot a big secret.) Well according to the back it’s about giving away $32,000 in a week, but why? I’m not telling. The novels about two guys, the narrator Will, who is telling the story after Jack died but a couple of years before him and his mother drown in Columbia (That’s the first page of the novel paraphrased, or the cover if you get the hardcover version). The second guy’s name is Hand; he’s the zany friend you wish you had growing up. You know the one who will do anything, has the wacky ideas, and gets annoying but always a party to be around. The two decide to travel around the world in one week and give away $32,000 dollars along the way. The catch? The people need to be deserving of the money, the countries need to be off the beaten path and not require visas to enter.Along the way in the travels of Will and Hand, Eggers throws some literary tricks into the mix that call into question all kinds of assumptions about the basic structure of the novel. I can’t say anymore about this though. I’d feel as if I was cheating anyone who read the book after reading this of the fun. About the NovelThe writing in the novel is more straightforward than in the first book. Much of the book is quite funny in a dry sardonic sort of way. It’s difficult after reading Eggers first book to believe that this novel isn’t also autobiographical in nature. The depressing qualities of H.W.O.S.G. come back through. Taking into account Egger’s life (his parents plus his sister have passed away) it is understandable that the topic of dealing with grief should be a dominant theme in his work. He offsets the grief though with humor that most of times works (sometimes the humor is too smart for it’s own good).There are a lot more things I want to talk about, but if I did the novel would be ruined. Eggers does some interesting things with the form of the novel, but they are just too good to reveal in a review to possible readers.ConclusionIf you liked Eggers first book I think you will like this. If you hated his first book I think you will still like, I did. Eggers is probably best appreciated by twenty and thirty something year olds, but I can see their being an appeal of this book to most readers of literary works. AfterwordThe author wishes to express the realization that this review is shoddy. As of this line only 29% of the review is dedicated to the actual book. The remaining 71% (now 72%) of the review has been a juvenile attempt at mocking Eggers writing style, especially the manner he handles the infinite introductions of H.W.O.S.G. The author acknowledges he is not half (or now 27%) the writer of Dave Eggers. The author of the review wonders why you have read this, wants to know why you care what he thinks and is considering swearing at you in an ironic manner, but then he realized he would be again just imitating Eggers, instead I’m going out and running down the beach and watch a Frisbee hang overhead, in that sublime manner that makes you realize the transcendence of life; and then maybe I’ll jump in a pool….. you know for the whole re-birth and baptism analogy."

4956,How We Are Hungry: Stories,Dave Eggers,3.75,12143,718,Jeff,4,"Ah, another Dave Eggers book. I keep reading these and I might have to admit to liking his work. This is a book of short stories. Here is why this is a better book than A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius: because the stories he wrote, are short stories. Eggers can’t meander here and there, and up and down before getting to the point. He has to hit it and hit it quick. Like the words themselves are costing him money. Like a hooker, a prostitute, a woman of the night. He can’t talk about MTV or household layouts, because that’s like getting a hand job and getting walked on while she’s wearing high heels. You can’t afford that! You’re on a budget! What are you going to eat next week? Raman again? Aren’t you tired of Ramen? I mean, you’re freaking 30 years old, you shouldn’t be eating like a freaking 18 year old college student any longer. You should be eating steak, every night. EVERY NIGHT! Then you will die via heart attack at the age of 45. This is the life you should be living. But no, you’re writing short stories, which aren’t half bad, except for that one about the girl that climbed the mountain. Man, that was a snoozer. What happened there? Lose your concentration I bet. I actually read a version of that story in a McSweeney’s compilation book. It was boring then too. You just can’t win with me. Don’t even try."
4668,Some Sort of Epic Grandeur: The Life of F. Scott Fitzgerald,Matthew J. Bruccoli,4.18,384,47,John,5,"I would recommend Professor Bruccoli's book to anyone who wants an in depth understanding of Fitzgerald. Some might dismiss the book on the basis that Bruccoli is an unabashed fan. But I would say so what if he's a fan--he's got some great insight in Fitzgerald's psyche. And even though he's a fan, he doesn't (in my opinion) observe Fitzgerald with rose colored glasses.Fitzgerald was so complex. He could be brutal in his personal relationships, he struggled with demons (mainly alcohol) for most of his life, and yet his writing displays such a high degree of sensitivity. Some passages of his prose have a quality of delicacy and fragility. Here's one of my favorite descriptive passages from Gatsby:And so it happened that on a warm windy evening Idrove over to East Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcelyknew at all. Their house was even more elaborate than Iexpected, a cheerful red and white Georgian Colonial mansionoverlooking the bay. The lawn started at the beach andran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumpingover sun-dials and brick walks and burning gardens—finallywhen it reached the house drifting up the side in brightvines as though from the momentum of its run. What a dynamic description of mere lawn!"
4959,Danny Boy: The Legend of the Beloved Irish Ballad,Malachy McCourt,2.96,136,16,Kathryn,4,"The first and only time I had an opportunity to perform ""Danny Boy"" was in the basement of a Catholic church for a group of seniors who were celebrating St. Patrick's Day and wanted a touch of Irish in the program. At the exact moment I arrived at the line, ""And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,"" there was a thunderous stampede heard overhead: the school had just released its students for the day.Which has (or perhaps should have) almost nothing to do with this review, although that hilarious juxtaposition of lyrics and sound kept many eyes from misting up, which they normally would have given the powerful emotions often conjured by a performance of ""Danny Boy,"" something Malachay McCourt, in his lovely little book, mentions repeatedly.Who wrote the lyrics? Where did the Londonderry Air originate (alright, it came from Londonderry but from whose pen (or possibly, in this case, from whose pipes or whose fiddle)? Who is speaking/singing and what is her/his relationship to Danny?No spoilers here, and McCourt doesn't necessarily provide a concrete answer to all these questions, but he does lay out enough information, both legendary and factual, to make this a very informative read for lovers of the song. McCourt's writing is sometimes humorous, often beautiful, and always informative as can be seen from a summarizing paragraph towards the book's end:""While 'Danny Boy' will always be touted as an Irish ballad, it was truly the product of many different worlds meshing together. Let it be the tune of a blind, Irish fiddler drifting across the sea, reaching an English barrister who would finally marry words and melody to create a song capable of describing, at least in part, the contents of the human heart. The song depicts the human condition, about the unknown and the black cloud of finality that accompanies it. The message is available to all those who want to hear it. 'Danny Boy' has a profound effect on people from all corners of the world, a trait it shares with the truest of any work of art."""
4960,A Monk Swimming,Malachy McCourt,3.33,3782,253,Kressel Housman,4,"Poor Malachy McCourt. When his book came out, the critics said, “He’s not Frank.” Goodreads reviewers echoed the same sentiment. But I don’t think there was much rivalry between them. They shared their fame the same way they pooled money to bring their younger brothers and mother over to the States. Their first writing project was a collaboration - a two-man play I haven’t read yet. And then came the books, which include some interesting overlaps. Malachy depicts Frank as a real gentleman, which comes across in Frank’s own books and the interviews available on Youtube. Frank depicts the child Malachy as a “dote” who could charm any roomful of people and the life of every party in adulthood. That outgoingness definitely comes across in this book, and also, in any interview with Malachy you might want to catch on Youtube.So it’s true that this book does not have the literary grace of Frank’s books, but my gosh, it’s funny! It’s also a bit ribald; Malachy tells you all about “sampling the fleshpots” in his travels from India to Europe. For that reason, I should probably put it on my “Regrettable Reads” shelf, but I can’t regret anything that made me laugh that hard. Frank’s books also made me laugh hard, but not as much as this. The man who drives me to work wondered, “What are you reading back there?” So I’m definitely looking forward to the resolution of Malachy’s story with his next memoir: how he got sober and lived happily ever after."

7979,"The Bellmaker (Redwall, #7)",Brian Jacques,3.95,18680,190,Amy,5,"I'm a little fuzzy on all the details, but I know I adored this book. Mariel, Dandin, and Mariel's father were all so dear to me.Instead of trying to recall details about the book, I'm gonna write a little something to Mr. Jacques (may he rest in peace.)Dear Brian Jacques,I only ever met you once in my lifetime. You came to a book signing at Third Place Books in Seattle a long, long time ago. I remember you saying, ""I love book signings: kids waiting in line for you to scribble on their new books! Hahaha!"" I've even put that quote up here, on Goodreads, and 33 people have liked it so far.Mr. Jacques, you were a huge influence on my childhood. For years, I tried and tried to come up with animal stories that would let me feel as thrilled in writing them as I did in reading your stories. Ultimately, I think I've failed, but hey, we all can't be as good as you. And don't worry, I'd never hold that against you. You were and always will be one of my favorite authors ever. Whenever it is that, Lord willing, I get married and have children, I own most of your books and plan on reading them out loud to my children. Your stories will be counted with The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, The Hobbit, Harry Potter, the Little House on the Prairie series, and whatever other classic books I may have forgotten.It makes me incredibly sad that you passed away this year, Mr. Jacques. 2011 already feels a little empty without you.Honestly, I don't know how you were doing with God, but I dearly hope I will see you in Heaven. I have so much I want to talk to you about! I barely knew you, but I really do miss you. I think I'm always going to cry a little when I read your books or think of your smile.You have done so much for me without meaning to. Thank you for brightening my childhood with so many amazing stories.I miss you.Sincerely,Amy Lind"
6727,Papillon,Henri Charrière,4.23,43813,1465,Anita,4,"My mother knew Papillon and another one of the characters in the book (Francoise). He was a customer of my uncle's restaurant Il Padrino, in Venezuela, back in the 60's,70's (after this story was told). My brother was just an infant/toddler at this time and they would take turns throwing him in the air, swinging him, etc.. I told this guy Neil about this and he was shocked that my family knew this guy. He had read the book and loved it so much. So as a gift, he gave me a copy of the book. This book was written in my uncle's other restaurant Il Pappagallo back in the day. What a great story!!!"
5400,The Last Stand of the Tin Can Sailors: The Extraordinary World War II Story of the U.S. Navy's Finest Hour,James D. Hornfischer,4.3,6303,353,Mike,5,"5 Battle Stars! There are few books that will impact you physically as well as mentally. This is one of them. I sit drained and awe-inspired. Hornfischer will take you into the heart of this final major sea battle off the coast of the Philippine Islands, a battle that should have been a slaughter of American ships by a vastly more powerful Japanese force. But a small force of destroyers/destroyer escorts and swirling naval air attacked, and attacked, and attacked until the Japanese force finally withdrew. The writing is so intense, I had to take breaks. Even after the battle, the American survivors fight to survive for 3 nights and 2 days when the rescue forces go to the wrong location. This surface battle and the naval air battle overhead filled me with awe at the sheer courage displayed. I can't think of another battle history that exceeds the power of this story. All time best book!"
7982,"Martin the Warrior (Redwall, #6)",Brian Jacques,4.13,35714,434,Cait • A Page with a View,5,"If you like medieval-type fantasy adventure stories, I cannot recommend the Redwall series enough. I know it's about talking animals, but it's seriously something adults would love as well! The whole world is so wonderfully detailed and complex. The stories get pretty emotional - I definitely teared up at a lot of battle scenes/deaths in middle school. They're pretty epic. The books were published in a different order than the stories take place, so you can read most of them in any order! Like there's a clear history to the world, but it doesn't matter too much. The stories take place in lots of different areas, too."
3867,The History of Love,Nicole Krauss,3.91,104567,9727,Michelle,5,"“Once upon a time there was a boy who loved a girl, and her laughter was a question he wanted to spend his whole life answering.”—Nicole Krauss, The History of Love I found this quote from a listicle (please don't judge me!) of 50 of the most beautiful sentences in literature. This one particular sentence left me with a heaping serving of ""the feels"" and so without a second thought, I chucked the book I was reading at that time and started reading ""The History of Love.""  A few chapters later, I realized that this was not the sappy-romantic book I was hoping for! The story is more heart-breaking, in a way. I'm quite happy to be proven wrong, though. Sad as it may be, the prose could take your breath away. I discovered another work of art, more beautiful than that one sentence that lead me to it. ""The History of Love"" is not really much of a history at all. It's more like a meditation on love, or an exploration of love. It's the story of a bunch of people who are not only searching for love, but also searching for themselves, and trying to find their places in the world. Once the characters' lives intertwine, the ending introduces questions of fate, destiny, and the things that connect us to each other and to the universe. More than that, though, the ending reaffirms the power of love (no, not the sappy 80's song!). It sustains through the years and unites people across decades, miles, and circumstances.  In the end, even though it isn't the romance I was hoping to read, I still came away feeling pretty darn good about love and love stories. How is it that even the people who have suffered the most from having fallen in love still remember it as the most precious thing in the universe? How do the folks who have not yet experienced it know it when they see it? And what in the world would be in the pages of the actual history of love? I don't think one volume would cut it! The book, unfortunately, doesn't give simple answers—but, of course, love is nothing if not complicated."
8249,"These Happy Golden Years (Little House, #8)",Laura Ingalls Wilder,4.17,54341,1011,Kate,5,"This is the book I read the night before I got married ten years ago. The reason for this? I think that ""These Happy Golden Years"" is the first book that I ever read in which a courtship and marriage was described in any detail - I was probably 8 or 9 on first reading of it. It seemed eminently suitable to read before my own marriage.The book makes me happy inside, the gentle way that Laura and Almanzo become a couple and go out on rides together. Almanzo's persistence in courting Laura, and the fact that he collected her every week in freezing winter weather from the first school she taught is beautiful. The times spent with friends and family, and happy teaching experiences for Laura are also lovely to read. She's a woman who knows she's loved and loves back wholeheartedly. But the book is also bittersweet. It's the last proper Little House book (""The First Four Years"" doesn't count as far as I'm concerned!) and everyone is growing up or growing old and it's that moment of change from child/teen to adult, dependence to independence that makes it so poignant."

7989,The Redwall Cookbook,Brian Jacques,4.19,1236,56,Taylor,4,"One of the hardest and best things about Brian Jacques 'Redwall' series is surviving through the lavish descriptions of delicious feasts. They make the mouth water, and the only time to effectively read these books is during the holidays when leftovers and goodies are abundant. Or during a good garden harvest. Happily, there is this wee, handy cookbook with recipes and short Redwall stories. I haven't tried the recipes yet, but they look good and read well. And I am really looking forward to reading Redwall or Mossflower (or any of the other zillion Redwall books) aloud to my kids, and then serving them ""Shrimp & Hotroot Soup"" or ""Foremoles Deeper'n Ever Pie"" for dinner. Lovely."
6692,Roald Dahl's Even More Revolting Recipes,Felicity Dahl,4.11,262,13,April Helms,4,"A collection of various recipes inspired by Roald Dahl, ranging from breakfast foods and simple drinks to meals and desserts. The illustrations are zany and active, just like Dahl’s works. The recipes range from very simple and quick to more complex. I like the emphasis in some of the recipes about having an adult help. The dishes, despite their names, actually look quite good, and the recipes themselves provide several chuckles. Excellent for both fans of Dahl, and as a springboard book to those who have not read his works."
7536,Anleitung zum Zickigsein,Laurie Notaro,3.89,15774,1129,M.fennell,5,"Frigging hilarious.I, in the five short years since initially discovering this gift to reading, have purchased no less than five copies of this book. Five, because every time I give it to a friend to read, it doesn't come back to me. It will be six shortly, when my mother fails to return the copy I gave her last week. In fact, this book is so funny it caused me to disown her.I gave her a copy to glance through, but she actually started to read, and began to laugh with quick bursts of air. Then bursts of air and full-on laughing. By the time I tried to prevent a scene, she was laughing so hard her face had turned red and people were staring. Rather than admit I was with the nut laughing to herself, I walked away.This is how much I love this book."
7541,"Winning by Losing: Drop the Weight, Change Your Life",Jillian Michaels,3.69,927,71,Dana,3,"Much of the information in this book is available elsewhere in plenty of bodybuilding/weight loss books. But there are a few things that stand out:1. The tone of the book. No b.s. She tells it to you straight. Yet she's kind as well. She shares her own weight struggles when she was a teenager.2. The metabolic type. The theory she follows is that every person converts food to energy differently, so it's essential to know how your body processes fats, proteins and carbohydrates. There are 3 metabolic types: fast oxidizers, slow oxidizers and balanced oxidizers. 3. The sample workout. Yes, other books have sample workouts, but hers is 12 weeks long, and rather than concentrating solely on weight lifting, she takes the circuit-training approach, so you can get your cardio in at the same time. She breaks it down into mini-circuits, performing 2 exercises back to back until you finish all of the sets, then moving to the next circuit."
7539,Winning the Future: A 21st Century Contract With America,Newt Gingrich,3.63,303,25,Frederick Meekins,4,"Over a decade has elapsed since The Contract With America catapulted Newt Gingrich to the forefront of American political discussion and the Republican Party into control of both houses of Congress. No longer confined by the restraints of public office, the former Speaker of the House now seeks to update and expand on this set of ideas in Winning The Future: A 21st Century Contract With America.Unlike the original Contract With America which dealt primarily with political and legislative issues, Winning The Future applies the outlook inspiring the book's antecedent to a wider array of social and cultural concerns. Reflective of the personality of the author of both documents, Winning The Future is an eclectic synthesis of conservative commonsense, futuristic policy blather, and a reluctance to accept certain shortcomings inherent to human nature.Winning The Future does a suburb job in examining the religious foundations of the United States. Gingrich uses his skill as an historian to trace recognition of this heritage from the Founding Fathers, through Abraham Lincoln, up to contemporary thinkers such as Samuel Huntington.From there, Gingrich uses the issue of the role of religion in the United States as a springboard to discuss the need for judicial reform. Gingrich views the attack on religious freedom as evidence of how the judiciary has gotten out of control. Newt does this by pointing out a number of rulings from the infamous Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and the activist legal philosophies of radical jurists such as Europhile Sandra Day O'Connor. He also offers suggestions on how the courts might be reigned in such as by impeaching judges going beyond the scope of the Constitution on the grounds of violating the Good Behavior Clause or by simply abolishing rogue judgeships all together.While a number of the proposals contained within the pages of Winning The Future are steeped in conservative commonsense realism, some of those characterized by futuristic speculation are just plain goofy. For example, Gingrich is under the impression that centralizing and computerizing all health records will lead to some kind of twenty-first century medical Renaissance.But doesn't technology merely take on the characteristics and shortcomings of those employing it? A quack will always be a quack.And this is to say nothing of the dangers and abuses that will result from further centralizing the most sensitive of information in a single place that will probably be administered by the government or as callous healthcare administrators. If my rights and well being are to be violated, those doing so should at least have to work to earn the opportunity.Despite his many insights, at various points Gingrich exhibits a flawed understanding of human nature that will cause his well-intentioned proposals to flounder in a manner similar to the Great Society programs the former Congressman has spent much of his political career claiming to stand against. For example, Gingrich touts a program called Earning By Learning he established that paid to $2.00 to children in public housing for every book they read.While the costs of the program initially came out of Gringrich's own pocket, who's going to pick up the tab should the program go nationwide? Furthermore, why should such an entitlement be for the so-called underprivileged who already have access to the same reading material as everyone else but simply refuse to avail themselves of it?Spending much of his time hobnobbing in elite government and media circles, Dr. Gingrich is also as mistaken about the nature of the immigrant hordes sweeping across America. Mired by his training as an historian, Gingrich assumes a model of immigration more fitting for the nineteenth century than the twenty-first.Gingrich writes, ""Nor am I concerned that a substantial number of new Americans are Hispanic. America has a long history of absorbing and blending people of many languages and backgrounds."" But for the most part, the vast majority of immigrants at that time were already steeped in a common Northern European (primarily Protestant) culture upon which American institutions were based.Even more importantly, immigrants of that period wanted to be Americans and not to merely suckle off the supple federal teat while expressing nothing but contempt for the host nation gracious enough to even allow them into our midsts. If Gingrich finds Hispanics so charming, maybe they can pile into the house next door to his like they have in many middle class neighborhoods where they cram thirty of their kinsman and associates into a single family dwelling and have no qualms about guzzling booze on the public sidewalk.Regardless of one's opinion of Newt Gingrich as either a conservative visionary seeking to plot America's course to the future, an egotistical fraud concerned for nothing but his own fame and fortune, or someone between the two extremes, Winning The Future will most definitely spark thought and discussion of the issues that will impact the nation in the coming years.by Frederick Meekins"
7538,Winning with People,John C. Maxwell,4.23,4721,107,Isis Sousa,5,"Like other Maxwell books, this one is also a very pleasant read. Maxwell's captivating writing style and the interesting topics he brings up within this book will inpire you.As I read each principle, I reflected upon the complex subject of relationships. Here are some of the eye-openers for me:The lens principle: who you are determine how you see others.The charisma principle: people is interested in people who is interested in them.The bedrock principle: trust is the foundation of any relationship.The Bob principle: when Bob has a problem with everyone, Bob is usually the problem.The 101 principle: Find the 1% we agree upon and give it 100% of our effort. - This particular principle helped me to re-discover a friend, I learned how to appreciate and enjoy a friendship with this individual.The friendship principle: all things being equal, people will work with people they like; all things not being equal, they still will. - The most inspiring of all principles, I think.If you have great skills with people, this book can be handy on helping you reflect where you are.If you need to enhance your poeple skills, this book has a solid foundation for you to start with!This is a great book for everybody, but essencial for those who work with people."

I thoroughly enjoyed Brad's own personal accounts of battles with some of the game's greatest players of the time.

I'm happy to recommend this book to anyone for it's instructional and entertainment value."
2941,The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe,Daniel Defoe,3.66,199284,4728,Melissa,1,"This is one of those books that really serves to remind a modern audience of why we should kill whitey. Robinson Crusoe is the story of a young man with atrociously bad luck who, unfortunately for any shipmates he ever has, suffers from an extreme case of wanderlust. Every ship he gets onto sinks, but he just keeps getting onto them. Even after he's got a nice, successful plantation of his own, he decides he's just GOT to get on ANOTHER ship to -- get this -- procure himself some slaves. It crashes of course, and he gets stranded alone on an island. Not to worry, though -- he's got a bible, and he successfully becomes a religious zealot while alone with nothing better to do. It's too bad that his only book couldn't have been a copy of Don Quixote or something because maybe then he'd have become a more interesting storyteller. But no, like so many people who have terrible luck, he turns to ""god"" and starts counting his ""blessings,"" more-or-less out of a lack of anything better to do. Then, after he's been alone for 24 years, he sees a footprint in the sand, and he totally freaks, and he becomes convinced it must belong to the devil. Ummm, ok. So I'm sitting there thinking, ""Maybe it's your own footprint."" But it takes this genius a whole day of scaring himself before he comes up with that explanation. Anyway, it turns out not to be his footprint at all, it actually belongs to the ""savages"" (Carribean Indians) who apparently visit the island sometimes in order to cook and eat their prisoners, which, for the record, was not actually a common practice among Indians in the Americas. And here's the part where you really hate white people. He then saves one of the prisoners from being eaten and makes him into his slave, who he renames ""Friday,"" teaches English, and converts to Christianity. Friday, instead of kicking this pompous jerk's posterior from here to next Friday after repaying whatever debt he owed Robinson for saving his life, is a faithful slave in every way for the remainder of the book. Friday speaks in a pidgin English, which is probably realistic enough for a man who learned English late in life from one solitary individual, but Robinson has an offensive habit of translating easy-enough-to-understand things that Friday says to us, the idiot readers (""At which he smiled, and said - 'Yes, yes, we always fight the better;' that is, he meant always get the better in fight""). Also, during Friday's religious education, he asks Robinson why god doesn't just kill the devil and end evil, and because there is actually no good answer to such a question for a religious person, Robinson simply pretends not to hear him and wanders away. What a jack*ss! Luckily, Robinson Crusoe's religious conversion doesn't last forever. As soon as he's back in civilization and making money hand over fist, he pretty much gives it up. Speaking of which, what was with the end of this book? He gets rescued, he goes home, but there's no emotional payoff, and instead he goes on about his European adventures with Friday. We don't care about the wolves and dancing bear! We want to know, did you learn anything from your years away? Do you feel like you missed out? Was anyone happy to see you? Did they have a funeral for you while you were missing? What did your mother do when she saw you again? Robinson Crusoe is a man without any of the human characteristics that make people interesting to read about when they get into difficult situations. He has no regrets, no personal longings, and he never reflects on his life before he was on the island during his decades on the island. I understand that this is just an ""adventure novel"" but people actually still read this tripe and consider it a classic!"

2942,A General History of the Pyrates,Daniel Defoe,3.8,489,33,Tal Good,4,"A book written by a sea captain about pirates and other sea captains during the time when pirates reigned. This book is essential for anyone who has more than a passing interest in the history of pirates. Johnson by no means appraises the deeds of these outlaws. As a sea captain himself, he is entirely against them and seems to be astounded by the public's interest of these outlaws. Due to the success of his book in 1724, he found himself writing more stories about pirates than he had previously expected he would.As an outcome of the time period the book was written in, the writing can be dry and the details extraneous. Johnson will write excessively of the minute details of what a sloop was carrying, when the aspect the reader wants to know about is the people it carried and how they lived. He also finds every opportunity he can to insert God and biblical verses to explain how doomed the pirates are due to their actions. Obviously, now we would find this to be outlandish in a historical documentation.If you are to read any of this book, I would suggest the chapters on Anne Bonnie and Mary Reed. Johnson appears to forget his dry listing of details when it comes to these two characters and starts telling the story of their lives based on historical documentation and word of mouth. It is obvious that something intrigued him about the ferocity of these two women, which in return makes their stories the most fun to read out of the bunch.Bare with the dry narration, and you will be rewarded with some rich, exciting pirate tales."
5126,"Women Who Love Books Too Much: Bibliophiles, Bluestockings & Prolific Pens from the Algonquin Hotel to the YA-YA Sisterhood",Brenda Knight,3.55,159,38,QNPoohBear,3,"This book contains a series of biographical profiles of women writers from ancient times to the late 20th-century. (The book was published in 2000 when J.K. Rowling had only published 3 Harry Potter books). The book is arranged by topic: First Ladies of Literature, about women who broke the mold and became the first of some type of literature; Ink in Their Veins, about women related to famous men; Mystics and Madwomen, my least favorite section, suggesting that women writers are all a little crazy; Banned, Blacklisted and Arrested, self-explanatory; Prolific Pens, writers who have published a multitude of books; Salonists and Culture Makers and finally Women Whose Books are Loved Too Much (adored authors). The writing style is very casual. There are no footnotes or citations but a bibliography is included in the end. It's obvious the author was only somewhat familiar with certain authors given the simplicity and minor errors in the profiles. The profiles are more casual than a wikipedia entry but similar in length and information. What the editor does very well is include women writers who are more obscure because of time period or subject matter. There are a number of Queer women profiled here as well. I would recommend this book to non-literature majors as a starting place to locate new potential favorite writers."
2565,Pride and Prejudice,Jane Austen,4.24,2223661,49830,Stephen,5,"6.0 stars. Confession...this book gave me an earth-shattering Janeaustegasm and I am feeling a bit spent and vulnerable at the moment, so please bear with me. You see, I decided I wanted to get more literated by reading the ""classicals"" in between my steady flow of science fiction, mystery and horror. The question was where to begin.After sherlocking through my Easton Press collection, I started by pulling out my Dickens and reading A Tale of Two Cities which I thought was jaw-dropping AMAZO and left me feeling warm, satisfied and content. It also made me made retrospectively pleased that I named my youngest daughter Sydney.After Two City “Tale”ing, I decided to give this book a whirl as I kept seeing it on GR lists of ""goodest books ever."" However, I must admit I was hesitant going in to this for two big reasons. One, I thought it might be a bit too romantical for me. The second, and much more distressing, reason was that Twilight was on many of the same lists as this book. Austen fans should pull a nutty over that one.So needless to say I went into this thinking I might hate it. Well, for the 999,987th time in my life (at least according to my wife’s records)...I was wrong!!! I absolutely loved this book and had a mammoth, raging heart-on for it from the opening scene at the breakfast table when Father Witty (Mr. Bennet) is giving sly sarcasm to Mrs. Mommie Put Upon. I literaphorically could not get enough of this story. I was instantly captivated by the characters and Elizabeth Bennet, the main protagonist, immediately became one of my all time favorite characters. Mr. Darcy joined that party as soon as he showed up in the narrative as I thought he was terrific as well.Overall, the writing could not have been better. It was descriptive, lush and brilliant. The story could not have been more engaging or intelligent and the characters could not have been more magnificentastic. Elizabeth and Fitz are both smart, witty, self-confident and good. Austen could not have written them better. Oh, and I am sorry if this is a bit of a minor spoiler but I need to add that George Wickham is a cock-blocking braggadouche of startling proportions. I needed to say that and now I feel better. This one has made it onto my list of All Time Favorite novels and is truly one of the classics that lives up to its billing. A FINAL WORD TO THE GUYS: ...Guys, do not fear the Austen...embrace the Austen...HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!!"
1488,The Bacchae of Euripides: A Communion Rite,Wole Soyinka,3.91,93,4,Phillip,4,"This is a hard play to talk about. On the one hand, I think it is a good play in its own right, and Soyinka is an extremely socially and politically conscious writer. However, I think that we can't forget that this is a reworking of Euripides' The Bacchae, and I think Soyinka has lost one major element of what made Euripides' play such powerful tragedy--our eventual sympathy for Pentheus. Soyinka spends so much time building Pentheus up as the oppressive, slave-owning military dictator that it is hard for us to feel bad when he is eventually killed. I think that, like the slaves who play a prominent role in Soyinka's play, we are rather pleased that the reign of Pentheus is over. We might feel bad for his mother and grandfather, who are the victims of Dionysus' violent revenge, but we don't sympathize with Pentheus. He goes from being a brutal dictator to a prancing fool, and the indictment of Dionysus for his brutal vengeance is somewhat weak. Of course, this change isn't surprising, given Soyinka's cultural and philosophical position as a postcolonialist and a Maxrist. And, a very critical viewer/reader might be deeply disturbed by our own sense of satisfaction at Pentheus' death, even though he was such a brutal and unlikeable character."
1485,Hippolytus,Euripides,3.81,3353,91,  LunaBel ,3,"Hippolytus Never take hasty decisionsNever judge too fastFor the consequences may be Greater than you can bear. Tarnished by pride, Hippolytus dares to defy Aphrodite. He refuses to show due respect to her, so she obtains revenge. She uses his father’s wife to bring him to his doom, and in this ordeal, many a person meets their death. Phaedra and Hippolytus fight in a game of gods and both die because of Aphrodite's and Artemis's caprices. The proud gods take revenge on others through playing with the lives of pious servants. Once again, Euripides mocks the gods. They do not hesitate to use humans as pawns in their wars, so do they really value the lives of their servants?  I can neither side with Hippolytus nor with Phaedra. I don’t see the issue from a gender perspective as much as from a religious one. In here, both humans act according to the paths that the gods set to them. Phaedra is manipulated into falling for Hippolytus, while Hippolytus is destroyed by the excessive faith? In Artemis (who does not do anything to save him. she just appears in the end, when he was dying, when it was too late to do anything, to clarify that he did not violate Phaedra). Hippolytus and Phaedra find themselves carried by events they cannot control. And mistake after mistake leads them to their death."
1487,Euripides' Bacchae,Beth Causey,3.83,12,1,Ian,5,"Euripides wanted to write short stories, he just didn't know it. Some of my favorite parts of his plays are the long, prosy speeches by some of the characters (I read a different edition that included the Iphigenia plays). Among Greek dramatists, he's also very good at psychology; he paints convincing portraits of his characters and they act for reasons and change their minds for reasons that have a lot of verisimilitude (hardly always the case in Greek drama). The Bacchae was a great horror story (basically), whereas the Iphigenia plays were an adventure (almost a comedy) and a quasi-tragedy."
1483,The Trojan Women and Other Plays,Euripides,3.87,188,17,Michael,5,"Ever see those newsreels of the last days for U.S. forces in Vietnam? Evacuating some of the local citizens who had helped us, but, without enough room for them all, leaving some behind to fend for themselves at the hands of the Viet Cong. Horrible stuff. That's what The Trojan Women reminded me of; all the last horrible details at the end of a war, seen from the losing side. Hecuba, queen of Troy, suddenly widowed, now facing a life of slavery to the Greeks and the unpleasant futures of her children -- she stands vividly depicted here, every inch a queen, every bit a woman, and thoroughly tragic and too intelligent to let the audience avoid even one little bit of the grim and grisly aspects her fate. Sounds rough, and it is, but also so bright with truthful characterizations and conflicts that it is still an excellent read. That Euripides was able to have this play performed at one of the Athens festivals just before the city-state was committing to a terribly misjudged assault on Sicily is remarkable. Also remarkable is that this play was written over 2,400 years ago and is still convincing and gripping. Customs have changed (a little), but people have not."
1486,The Trojan Women and Hippolytus,Euripides,3.56,25,3,Gary,5,"This is a powerful play to show the devasating effect of war on family, religion, and community. The play is set in the immediate aftermath of the Trojan War. All of the men have been killed, and the women have been taken into captivity. In his typical style, Euripedes shows the gods to be unreliable and the Greeks to be suspect in their motives for conducting the war. The Trojans are shown to be noble and heroic. The play was performed during the Second Peloponnesian War after Athens had ravaged the city of Melos. Euripedes powerful anti-war statement comes just before the disasterous attempt by Athens to invade Sicily. We see the suffering in turn of Hecuba, Cassandra (who faces death along with Agamemnon), Andromache, and Helen (who gets little sympathy from Euripedes). Those interested in rhetoric will see Euripedes' answer to Gorgias ""Encomium on Helen"" in Hecuba's speech of blame. This play provides an interesting frame for understanding events in 5th century Athens, but also provides a universal statement on the nature of war."
1484,"Euripides' Bacchae, Focus Classical Library (Focus Classical Library)",Steven Esposito,3.72,57,6,Jim,5,"I read the version of Euripides's The Bacchae translated by Reginald Gibbons and Charles Segal published by Oxford. Robert Calasso's The Marriage of Cadmus and harmony taught me about the dynamics of Greek mythology, and this play by Euripides is a good example. Dionysos comes in person to Thebes, with whose royal family he is related, but meets with nothing but disbelief from Pentheus, the ruler and son of his aunt. This sets up the play for the revenge of a disbelieved god, at the expense of Pentheus and his entire family."
1482,Medea - Literary Touchstone Classic,Euripides,3.83,43628,1103,Kalliope,4,"Medea, with her suffering, her hatred, her cruelty, has been present this week in my life. Her myth living in various guises of representation. And all engaged me in various degrees and manner. It all started on Monday when, touring the Thyssen Musem in the search of paintings which had to do with the idea of ‘Travel”, I stopped to admire this painting, The Argonauts Leaving Colchis, by Ercole de Roberti (ca 1480). This depicts the earlier part of the Myth – the adventure in Colchis, The Voyage of Argo: The Argonautica. As the lovely Medea, in read, is already in the Argos, this represents the return trip with Golden Fleece on board. There is no hint of their dark future. On Tuesday I watched Pasolini’s classic, from 1969,with the magnificent Maria Callas impersonating Medea. Pasolini’s account gives us the full myth, from the youth of Jason under the care of the Centaur, until the final gruesome deed perpetrated by Medea. What enraptured me of this film was Pasolini’s ability to portray an ominous barbaric kingdom. Sinister in all its splendour. For splendorous the filming certainly is. Just to admire his choice of locations is it worth watching this film. These are: Göreme in Capadocia, with those haunting caves and extended yellow land; the imposing and Aleppo fortress, which we may very well lose as Syria is now under the control of other dark forces; and parts of the delicate Camposanto in Pisa. Beautiful.The only time Callas agreed to act without singing was for this Medea. She and her director succeed in giving us a cold hearted Medea, possessed by her hatred and full of feelings of revenge, but who is in control of hers and other’s destiny. Disheartening.Then I finally landed in and read a text, the major literary source, Euripides play. The tragedy begins at the end. This is Medea’s revenge. There were two aspects that drew my attention most in Euripides. One was his pride in the Greek civilization, for he justifies Medea’s barbarity as precisely that, the act of a barbarian. Impossibly expected from a Greek.And second his lines on the plight of women. Medea’s lmost out of a feminist pamphlet, but this is Euripides’ stylus. Of all things with life and understanding,We women are the most unfortunate,First, we need a husband, someone we getFor an excessive price. He then becomesThe ruler of our bodies. This misfortuneAdds still more troubles to the grief we have,Then comes the crucial struggle: this husbandWe’ve selected, is he good or bad?For a divorce loses women all respect,Yet we can’t refuse to take a husband,Then, when she goes into her husband’s home,With its new rules and different customs,She needs a prophet’s skill to sort out the manWhose bed she shares...My latest Medea was last night, when I attended a performance of Seneca’s version Medea. This play focuses more on Medea’s abilities as a magician and zeroes in sharply into her hatred and rage than does Euripides. The quality of the performance wavered between some less convincing passages and some truly brilliant ones. I withheld my interest when hysteria took over the tragic, but there was an unforgettable representation of magical rites. If the play had begun with an astonishing enactment of the beginning of the Universe--the ancient Greek Big Bang--, when out of the amorphous chaos a series of deities emerged, the stage later offered Medea in her rage engaged in a metamorphosis through which she conjured up her powers. A frenzy of mud and voices, of dislocated movements and terrorizing tremors build up to a climatic trance, and Medea, becoming one with the goddess Earth, adjured the destruction of the Kingdom of Corinth.To my astonishment I found myself gradually slouching in my chair, pulled down by my daze and holding my breath—clearly I could not resist being dragged by the intoxicating trance.Unforgettable.---------There is at least one more Medea waiting for my attention...Christa Wolfs Medea..... for when I have recovered."

1673,Uno y el Universo,Ernesto Sabato,3.85,311,10,David Ceballos Correa,4,"En este libro de ensayos, artículos y aforismos, Sábato nos invita a reflexionar sobre la ciencia (y, en particular, sobre la física): la archiconocida disputa entre el fundamentalismo del dogma imperante y el revuelo que levanta el nuevo paradigma revolucionario, donde este último al fin toma lugar sobre el primero, mientras se cultiva el germen del futuro heredero (divertida forma de aplicar la tesis nietzscheana del eterno retorno); o los dimes y diretes de la farándula académica científica (un festín que parece ser transversal para toda disciplina, científica, social o artística); o la creciente Babilonia erigida por el ejercicio de la especialización, con un extremo liderado por la física cuántica y el otro sostenido por los físicos relativistas (aunque hoy sabemos que los esfuerzos parecen ir en la dirección contraria, hacia la Teoría del Todo, como sí lo logró, por más de 1000 años, la Teoría de los cuatros elementos de Aristóteles).Como siempre es un agrado leer a Sábato no solo por la profundidad, certeza y sarcasmo de sus reflexiones, sino que también por su vasto dominio de otras áreas del conocimiento, en específico para con la literatura, la pintura y la política. Algunos artículos menos científicos pero muy recomendables son: i) Surrealismo, en el que intenta desmitificar los principios de este movimiento (del que fue parte y amigo personal de Breton) que llamaban simplemente a crear, en una especie de reflujo catártico, innato y visceral, lo que por cierto, a la luz de los hechos contemporáneos, no es más que un manifiesto de buenas intenciones, en exceso entusiastas, como él diría con no poca sorna, pues todo ejercicio creativo requiere de al menos un dominio elemental del lenguaje bajo práctica; ii) Realismo, más en tierras literarias, en el que realiza una crítica a los autodenominados escritores realistas que se ufanan de representar a la realidad tal como quién replica un experimento de laboratorio, que desconocen la vitalidad de que cada experiencia de vida es singular, por lo que la interpretación de ella en un escrito literario también lo es; y iii) Pitágoras, a quién acusa como el culpable del actual imperio de la matemática, esa villanesca disciplina a la que nuestras mentes deben adaptarse desde edades tempranas, y que gobierna nuestra forma de reflexionar y entender el cosmos (una tesis, supongo, entretenida para todos aquellos detrás de teorías del complot). En resumen, un libro entretenido, mordaz, y que me impulsa a seguir por los otros ensayos del maestro argentino. Para cerrar, transcribo un artículo breve y que contiene el espíritu de la obra:Física escandalosa: ""En el buen tiempo viejo, un señor trabajaba un año en un escritorio, haciendo cálculos, y luego enviaba un telegrama a un observatorio: ‘Dirijan el telescopio a la posición tal y verán un planeta desconocido’. Los planetas eran muy corteses y tomaban lugar dónde se les indicaba, cómo en un ballet bien organizado. Hoy, las partículas atómicas aparecen de súbito y cómo por escotillón, haciendo piruetas. La física de antaño tenía algo de fiesta de salón cómo música de Mozart, mientras que ahora parece una feria de diversiones, con salas de espejo, laberintos de sorpresas, tiro al blanco y hombres que pregonan fenómenos.Y a la astronomía, que era una recatada niña de su hogar, laboriosa y modesta, le ha salido ahora un hermano que ensucia la casa, convierte el altillo en polvorín, hace preguntas insoportables e inventa cuentos descabellados."""

Τον κόσμο τον κυβερνάει το Κακό που συνυπάρχει με το Σκοτάδι. Το Σκοτάδι είναι ο φυσικός χώρος των τυφλών. Επομένως,η ""Σέκτα των Τυφλών""είναι οι κυβερνήτες που μας επιβάλλουν φόβο,αμαρτίες και ενοχές. Αυτοί είναι υπαίτιοι και υπερδύναμοι. Ο άνθρωπος είναι ένας κόκκος άμμου στο Σύμπαν και προσπαθεί μέσα στην άγνοια του να συσχετίσει θεωρίες συμπαντικές για να αιτιολογήσει την ύπαρξη του. Αυτή λοιπόν είναι η τρομοκρατική θεωρία περί Σκοτεινού Κακού που χειραγωγεί την ανθρωπότητα με κυβερνήτες τη ""Σέκτα των Τυφλών"". Αυτή ακριβώς η εμμονή του παράφρονα πρωταγωνιστή Φερνάντο Βιδάλ Όλμος-συγγραφέα,θριαμβεύει και αποκαλύπτεται σε μια μυστηριώδη οργάνωση (Σέκτα των Τυφλών). Η οποία με εργαλείο και προκάλυμμα την τραγική αναπηρία ως μέσο συμπόνοιας,κυριαρχεί και διευθύνει την παγκόσμια επιχείρηση που ραδιουργεί και επωφελείται σκοτεινά και ύπουλα.

Μέχρι εκείνη τη στιγμή ή, για να το πω καλύτερα, μέχρι τη στιγμή που προηγήθηκε εκείνου του ονείρου της παιδικής μου ηλικίας, ζούσα στην παραζάλη της έρευνάς μου, νιώθοντας να είμαι στο έλεος μιας τρελής έλλειψης συνείδησης. Οι φόβοι και ο τρόμος που είχα νιώσει μέχρι εκείνη τη στιγμή δεν είχαν μπορέσει να με εξουσιάσουν. Ολόκληρο το είναι μου έμοιαζε να έχει εκτοξευτεί σε μια τρελή κούρσα προς την άβυσσο, που τίποτα δεν μπορούσε να σταματήσει. Μόνο τη στιγμή εκείνη, καθισμένος στη λάσπη, στο κέντρο μιας υπόγειας σπηλιάς που ούτε καν μπορούσα να υποψιαστώ τα όριά της, μέσα στο απόλυτο σκοτάδι, άρχισα να συνειδητοποιώ την απόλυτη και φρικτή μοναξιά μου. [...]. Και, έτσι, ονειρευόμενοι και για τους άλλους οι καλλιτέχνες, αυτά τα εύθραυστα πλάσματα, κατορθώνουν να αρθούν πάνω από την προσωπική τους δυστυχία και γίνονται ερμηνευτές και σωτήρες (πονεμένοι) του συλλογικού πεπρωμένου. H δυστυχία μου όμως ήταν πάντα διπλή, επειδή η αδυναμία μου, το παθητικό πνεύμα μου, η αναποφασιστικότητά μου και η αβουλία μου με εμπόδιζαν να κατακτήσω εκείνη τη νέα τάξη πραγμάτων, εκείνο τον Νέο Κόσμο, που είναι το έργο τέχνης• και κατέληγα πάντα να πέφτω από τις σκαλωσιές εκείνου του ποθητού οικοδομήματος που θα με έσωζε.

1667,El túnel,Ernesto Sabato,4.04,28918,1664,Glenn Russell,5,"One of the giants of Latin American literature, Ernesto Sábato (1911-2011) lived most of his life in Buenos Aires, Argentina and periodically committed his own manuscripts to the flames, noting in one interview with wry satisfaction how fire is purifying. Fortunately, in addition to many essays, three of his novels survive. Before commenting on ‘The Tunnel’, his first novel written in 1948, some observations on his other two: ‘On Heroes and Tombs’, Sábato’s dark, brooding 500 pager includes an entire hallucinogenic, mindbending section, “Report on Blind People”. The novel also features young Martin and the object of his obsessive love, Alejandra, a reclusive young lady who deals with serious bouts of madness. With every page turned, a reader is led ever further down murky, winding corridors of memory and imagination. Not an easy read. And Sábato’s second full-length novel, ‘The Angel of Darkness’ is even darker and more brooding, where Sábato himself takes on the role of main character and first-person narrator. In one outlandish scene, Sábato has a nightmare where he shows up on his wedding day as groom wearing only his underwear, marrying a television celebrity with blind Jorge Luis Borges standing in as best man. I mention Borges’s blindness since this novel also involves a search for a Society of the Blind rumored to be responsible for all the world’s ills. With its unique combination of magical realism and philosophic reflections, I judge this as one of the greatest novels ever written. However, on this point, I am an army of one since nearly all critics and readers cite this work as dense, heavy and overly cerebral. Turning to ‘The Tunnel’, Juan Pablo Castel, first-person narrator of Sábato’s short novel, is a painter who becomes obsessed with a young woman who has a particular appreciation for a scene in one of his paintings. And although ‘The Tunnel’ is the same length as Camus’s ‘The Stranger’ and both are considered works of existential alienation, the obsessive Castel is a universe away from Meursault’s indifference. And to whom may we compare Castel? For my money, narrators in Tommaso Landolfi’s tales of obsession – aristocratic and condescending down to their toes, looking at their fellow humans, even those educated and cultured, or, perhaps, especially those educated and cultured, as a rabble of vulgar, ugly, gluttonous, gross morons.Back to Castel’s obsession for the young woman. The opening line of the novel: “It should be sufficient to say that I am Juan Pablo Castel, the painter who killed Maria Iribarne.” Hi sits in the room where he is locked up and writes down how once he set eyes on Maria Iribarne he was driven mad by desire. This is one compelling story. Once I started reading, I couldn’t put the book down until I finished. My sense is Sábato wanted his reader to do exactly that – read in one sitting to get the full emotional and psychic impact of Castel’s obsession. At one point Castel relates a nightmare where he is in an unfamiliar house surrounded by friends and one sinister stranger. We read, “The man began to change me into a bird, into a man-size bird. He began with my feet: I saw them gradually turning into something like rooster claws. Then my whole body began to change, from the feet up, like water rising in a pool. . . . but when I began to speak it was at the top of my voice. Then I was amazed by two facts: the words I wanted to say came out as squawks, screeches that fell on my ears as desperate and alien, perhaps because there was still something human about them, and, what was infinitely worse, my friends did not hear the squawking, just as they had not seen my enormous bird-body.” This nightmare foreshadows a scene in ‘The Angel of Darkness’ where Sábato walks down a street in Buenos Aires, having been transformed into a half-blind, barely aware, four foot bat. The theme of blindness pops up continually. Maria Iribarne’s husband is blind. During one emotionally charged conversation, Castel accuses Maria of ‘deceiving a blind man’. At another point, Castel conveys how he was blinded by the painful glare of his own shyness and at still another, how his blindness prevented him from seeing a flaw in an idea. And, turns out, we can see how Castel’s obsession made him blind when it came to Maria. For example, the following exchange where Castel first converses with her: The hardness in her face and eyes disturbed me. “Why is she so cold?” I asked myself. “Why?” Perhaps she sensed my anxiety, my hunger to communicate, because for an instant her expression softened, and she seemed to offer a bridge between us. But I felt that it was a temporary and fragile bridge swaying high above an abyss. Her voice was different when she added:“But I don’t know what you will gain by seeing me. I hurt everyone who comes near me.” "

Then my whole body began to change, from the feet up, like water rising in a pool. . . . but when I began to speak it was at the top of my voice. Then I was amazed by two facts: the words I wanted to say came out as squawks, screeches that fell on my ears as desperate and alien, perhaps because there was still something human about them, and, what was infinitely worse, my friends did not hear the squawking, just as they had not seen my enormous bird-body.” This nightmare foreshadows a scene in ‘The Angel of Darkness’ where Sábato walks down a street in Buenos Aires, having been transformed into a half-blind, barely aware, four foot bat. The theme of blindness pops up continually. Maria Iribarne’s husband is blind. During one emotionally charged conversation, Castel accuses Maria of ‘deceiving a blind man’. At another point, Castel conveys how he was blinded by the painful glare of his own shyness and at still another, how his blindness prevented him from seeing a flaw in an idea. And, turns out, we can see how Castel’s obsession made him blind when it came to Maria. For example, the following exchange where Castel first converses with her: The hardness in her face and eyes disturbed me. “Why is she so cold?” I asked myself. “Why?” Perhaps she sensed my anxiety, my hunger to communicate, because for an instant her expression softened, and she seemed to offer a bridge between us. But I felt that it was a temporary and fragile bridge swaying high above an abyss. Her voice was different when she added:“But I don’t know what you will gain by seeing me. I hurt everyone who comes near me.” "

7880,Little Plum,Rumer Godden,4.2,317,18,Gale,3,"LITTLE GIRLS AT WAR OVER JAPANESE DOLLSRumer Godden specializes in creating a gentle fantasy world where dolls have Lives--or in this case, Thoughts--of their own. Nona and Belinda Fell treasure their three Japanese dolls: Miss Happiness, Miss Flower and Little Peach. These special ""persons"" enjoy their own Japanese dollhouse and clothes, beds, foods (green paint water tea) and celebrate many traditional customs. While the dolls converse privately, the sisters (who are unaware of theri dolls' commuications) plan and dream of a new friendship. They themselves are very different: nine-year-old Nona is neat, polite and very talentd with her creative fingers. While eight-year-old Belinda is a fearless tomboy, a reckless daredevil who defies parental authority, common sense and even the laws of gravity, to satisfy her whims. But things get really interesting when a rich family buys and improves the big House Next Door. What delicious opportunities to observe the doings and possessions as they move it--and there is a daughter too! Gem proves to be a ""motherless"" only child, waited on by her personal nanny and a large household staff--all supervised by an authoritarian aunt. The kindly father is often away on business, but after one trip he brings his daughter a Japanese doll of her own. Poor Little Plum--as the spying girls name her and discover--is neglected by her lonely mistress. Belinda decides to teach the proper care of Japanese dolls to the sulking snob next door, but soon the teasing and critical notes escalate into a non-verbal war between the headstrong young ladies. Will that ""rough child"" ever be allowed in the front door of the wealthy but isolated Tiffany-Jones' mansion? And will Gem ever accept cultural tutelage from mere middle-class English children? This is a delightful read-aloud story for Girls Under Ten. And all women who fondly remember the dolls of their girlhood.  (June 16, 2011. I welcome dialogue with teachers.)"

8737,The Last Temptation of Christ,Nikos Kazantzakis,4.14,9600,600,Mohamed Al Marzooqi,5,يمكن اعتبار نيكوس كازانتزاكيس أحد أقل الكتاب حظًا في القرن العشرين، فقد ترشح في العام 1956 لنيل جائزة نوبل، ولكنه خسرها بفارق صوت واحد في التصويت لصالح ألبير كامو. وتعرضت بعض أعماله لعبث الرقابة -بل ومُنعَ نشرها- في العديد من دول العالم. إلا أن هذا الكتاب الذي نشره كازانتزاكيس في عام 1951 هو الأكثر إثارة للجدل من بين جميع كتبه (أو الأقل حظًا في معركته مع الرقابة)، إلى درجة أن البابا آنذاك عمد إلى إدراجه ضمن لائحة الكتب الممنوعة في الفاتيكان سنة 1954.ويبدو أن سوء الحظ هذا تحول إلى لعنة لاحقت كل من قرّر الإهتمام بكتاب كازنتزاكيس، ففي فرنسا قامت مجموعة من المتعصبين الكاثوليكيين بإضرام النّار في دار للسينما عام 1988، احتجاجاً على عرضها الفيلم الذي أخرجه المخرج الأمريكي مارتن سكورسيزي والمستوحى من هذه الرواية! غضب هؤلاء المتعصبون لأنهم سمعوا (ولن أقول قرأوا .. لأنني أشك أن أمثال هؤلاء يقرأون) أن كازانتزاكيس يتحدث في روايته عن المسيح كإنسان وليس كإله. وهذا ما يتعارض كلياً مع العقيدة المسيحية. وهو ما لا يستطيع أن يتحمله الأصوليون المتزمتون أما السبب الآخر الذي أغضب هؤلاء المتزمتين كان تلميح كازنتزاكيس إلى إغواء متخيّل تعرّض له المسيح وهو معلق بالمسامير على الصليب يدفعه للتخلي عن رسالته. فعقدة الرواية تبدأ فعلاً في ال40 صفحة الأخيرة منها عندما يصرخ المسيح وهو يتفطّر ألمًا على الصليب: إلهي إلهي، لماذا تركتني؟! عبارة قد توحي بأن المسيح راح يشك في حقيقة دعوته في آخر لحظة ويتمنى لو أنه لم يفعل ما فعله ويصل إلى هذه النتيجة المأسويةبالطبع فإن المتعصبين (مسيحيين كانوا أو مسلمين) لا يستطيعون القبول بمثل هذه التساؤلات المشينة التي تهدد اعتقادهم. ولذلك راحوا يلاحقون الكتاب بغية صلبه كما لاحق أسلافهم من اليهود المتعصبين -في الرواية- السيد المسيح!إن السؤال الأخلاقي الذي طرحه كازنتزاكيس في الرواية في رأيي (والذي لم يكن له علاقة بالمسيح وحده بل بكل أصحاب القضايا والمناضلين أو سمهم مائشت) يتمحور في لحظة الإغواءالأخير تلك، عندما كان المسيح قاب قوسين أو أدنى من الندم والحسرة على حياته التي أضاعها مقابل ربٍ ومريدين وأتباع تخلوا عنه، ورسالة لم يعد متأكدًا من جدواها!لست متأكدًا ما إذا كان المسيح (وأنا هنا أؤكد بأنني أتحدث عه كشخصية روائية حتى لا يهاجمني أحد المسيحيين المتعصبين ويقوم بحرق حسابي) قد اتخذ القرار الصحيح في النهاية، وما إذا كان قبوله لوضعه كان بسبب إيمانه -أخيرًا- بالرسالة التي ظنّ أنه يحملها، أم لأن الأمور كانت سيئة لدرجة أنها لا يمكن أن تسوء أكثر من ذلك (ما هو الأسوأ من الصلب والدماء تنزّ من كل مسامات جسدك أمام حشد حيواني يرشقك بالشتائم والسباب؟! أعتقد أن الموت في هذه الحالة أهون بكثير من البقاء في هذه الوضع المزري)بالطبع لن يفهم المتعصبون هذا الكلام، ولن يدركوا بأن الصوة الإنسانية للمسيح في هذه الرواية تجعله أكثر عظمة من الصورة الأسطورية أو التبجيلية التي رسختها أجيال المؤمنين المتلاحقة على مرّ الصور. وهذا الأمر ينسحب على المسلمين كذلك فلا زلت أذكر التأثر الذي أصابني (وأنا طالب في الإعدادية) عندما قرأت للمرة الأولى عبقريات العقّاد (عبقرية محمّد وأبوبكر وعمر) التي قدمني فيها العقّاد للإنساني في هذه الشخصيات بعد أن حولها منهج التربية الإسلامية في لاوعيي لنماذج صارمة بعيدة عن إنسانيتها وصلتها الوثيقة بالحياة.
7874,The Longest Walk: An Odyssey of the Human Spirit,George Meegan,3.71,55,11,Indy Hart,3,"George Meegan decided to take a walk. Not just any walk; he wanted to walk from the tip of South America to the arctic shores of Alaska. The book in which he chronicles his journey is as lengthy a read as was his walk, but I found it worthwhile to read his experiences throughout his journey and try to glean some understanding that I could apply in my own life.One passage that stood out to me:How dreadfully the fear of consequences can stifle so many valiant potential deeds, I thought, a fear threatening like a black hole to annihilate the star of one's soul, sucking the very matter out of an idea until it collapses and disappears, leaving nothing but a memory, a dream unfulfilled.It is so important that we overcome the hesitation caused by fear, so that we might embrace possibility. The author described his life-changing walk in detail. And I think his final reflections are universally paramount:I gave thanks for the opportunity to share my fellow human beings' laughter as well as their sadness, their love as well as their misery, and for learning to love this frail, endangered, yet still magnificent planet that had borne me safely and in harmony with my road. I had found the essential, if flawed, goodness that resides in everyone, everywhere."

Οι φόβοι και ο τρόμος που είχα νιώσει μέχρι εκείνη τη στιγμή δεν είχαν μπορέσει να με εξουσιάσουν. Ολόκληρο το είναι μου έμοιαζε να έχει εκτοξευτεί σε μια τρελή κούρσα προς την άβυσσο, που τίποτα δεν μπορούσε να σταματήσει.

1676,El túnel,Ernesto Sabato,4.04,28918,1664,Glenn Russell,5,"One of the giants of Latin American literature, Ernesto Sábato (1911-2011) lived most of his life in Buenos Aires, Argentina and periodically committed his own manuscripts to the flames, noting in one interview with wry satisfaction how fire is purifying. Fortunately, in addition to many essays, three of his novels survive. Before commenting on ‘The Tunnel’, his first novel written in 1948, some observations on his other two: ‘On Heroes and Tombs’, Sábato’s dark, brooding 500 pager includes an entire hallucinogenic, mindbending section, “Report on Blind People”. The novel also features young Martin and the object of his obsessive love, Alejandra, a reclusive young lady who deals with serious bouts of madness. With every page turned, a reader is led ever further down murky, winding corridors of memory and imagination. Not an easy read. And Sábato’s second full-length novel, ‘The Angel of Darkness’ is even darker and more brooding, where Sábato himself takes on the role of main character and first-person narrator. In one outlandish scene, Sábato has a nightmare where he shows up on his wedding day as groom wearing only his underwear, marrying a television celebrity with blind Jorge Luis Borges standing in as best man. I mention Borges’s blindness since this novel also involves a search for a Society of the Blind rumored to be responsible for all the world’s ills. With its unique combination of magical realism and philosophic reflections, I judge this as one of the greatest novels ever written. However, on this point, I am an army of one since nearly all critics and readers cite this work as dense, heavy and overly cerebral. Turning to ‘The Tunnel’, Juan Pablo Castel, first-person narrator of Sábato’s short novel, is a painter who becomes obsessed with a young woman who has a particular appreciation for a scene in one of his paintings. And although ‘The Tunnel’ is the same length as Camus’s ‘The Stranger’ and both are considered works of existential alienation, the obsessive Castel is a universe away from Meursault’s indifference. And to whom may we compare Castel? For my money, narrators in Tommaso Landolfi’s tales of obsession – aristocratic and condescending down to their toes, looking at their fellow humans, even those educated and cultured, or, perhaps, especially those educated and cultured, as a rabble of vulgar, ugly, gluttonous, gross morons.Back to Castel’s obsession for the young woman. The opening line of the novel: “It should be sufficient to say that I am Juan Pablo Castel, the painter who killed Maria Iribarne.” Hi sits in the room where he is locked up and writes down how once he set eyes on Maria Iribarne he was driven mad by desire. This is one compelling story. Once I started reading, I couldn’t put the book down until I finished. My sense is Sábato wanted his reader to do exactly that – read in one sitting to get the full emotional and psychic impact of Castel’s obsession. At one point Castel relates a nightmare where he is in an unfamiliar house surrounded by friends and one sinister stranger. We read, “The man began to change me into a bird, into a man-size bird. He began with my feet: I saw them gradually turning into something like rooster claws. Then my whole body began to change, from the feet up, like water rising in a pool. . . . but when I began to speak it was at the top of my voice. Then I was amazed by two facts: the words I wanted to say came out as squawks, screeches that fell on my ears as desperate and alien, perhaps because there was still something human about them, and, what was infinitely worse, my friends did not hear the squawking, just as they had not seen my enormous bird-body.” This nightmare foreshadows a scene in ‘The Angel of Darkness’ where Sábato walks down a street in Buenos Aires, having been transformed into a half-blind, barely aware, four foot bat. The theme of blindness pops up continually. Maria Iribarne’s husband is blind. During one emotionally charged conversation, Castel accuses Maria of ‘deceiving a blind man’. At another point, Castel conveys how he was blinded by the painful glare of his own shyness and at still another, how his blindness prevented him from seeing a flaw in an idea. And, turns out, we can see how Castel’s obsession made him blind when it came to Maria. For example, the following exchange where Castel first converses with her: The hardness in her face and eyes disturbed me. “Why is she so cold?” I asked myself. “Why?” Perhaps she sensed my anxiety, my hunger to communicate, because for an instant her expression softened, and she seemed to offer a bridge between us. But I felt that it was a temporary and fragile bridge swaying high above an abyss. Her voice was different when she added:“But I don’t know what you will gain by seeing me. I hurt everyone who comes near me.” "
5918,Ruthless Rhymes for Heartless Homes and More Ruthless Rhymes,Harry Graham,3.86,35,7,Kay,4,"For anyone who loves deliciously sardonic doggerel. Especially recommended for Gilbert & Sullivan listeners, Edward Gorey appreciators, and folk of that ilk. I definitely qualify as I once made a salt-dough set of Christmas tree ornaments shaped into figures of famous opera deaths: Scarpia impaled on his dagger, Tosca taking the high jump, Gilda in her sack, Radames hitting his last high C (and using up that last bit of oxygen in the tomb)... you get the picture. If you love dark humor, these rhymes will set you giggling. They're wonderfully misanthropic -- it's hard to imagine that many of them are from the turn of the last century, a time most of us associate with a certain saccharine quality.My favorite in the book is probably, ""L'Enfant Glacé""""When Baby's cries grew hard to bearI popped him in the Frigidaire.I never would have done so ifI'd known that he'd be frozen stiff.My wife said: 'George, I'm so unhappé!Our darling's now completely frappé!'"""
1228,Life of Pi,Yann Martel,3.88,1083961,43241,Eva,5,"It is not so much that The Life of Pi, is particularly moving (although it is). It isn’t even so much that it is written with language that is both delicate and sturdy all at once (which it is, as well). And it’s certainly not that Yann Martel’s vision filled passages are so precise that you begin to feel the salt water on your skin (even though they are). It is that, like Bohjalian and Byatt and all of the great Houdini’s of the literary world, in the last few moments of your journey – after you’ve felt the emotions, endured the moments of heartache, yearned for the resolution of the characters’ struggle – that you realize the book is not what you thought it was. The story transforms, instantly, and forever.And in those last few chapters, you suddenly realize that the moral has changed as well.You feel Martel’s words lingering, suggesting, and you find yourself wondering whether you are his atheist who takes the deathbed leap of faith – hoping for white light and love? Or the agnostic who , in trying to stay true to his reasonable self, explains the mysteries of life and death in only scientific terms, lacking imagination to the end, and, essentially, missing the better story?There is no use in trying to provide a brief synopsis for this ravishing tale of a young boy from India left adrift in the Pacific in a lifeboat with a tiger who used to reside in his father’s zoo in Pondicherry. There is no use because once you finish the book you might decide that this was not, indeed, what the book was about at all. There is no use because, depending on your philosophical bent, the book will mean something very different to your best friend than it will to you. There is no use because it is nearly impossible to describe what makes this book so grand.Read this book. Not because it is an exceptional piece of literary talent. It is, of course. But there are many good authors and many good books. While uncommon, they are not endangered. Read this book because in recent memory - aside from Jose Saramago’s arresting Blindness – there have been no stories which make such grand statements with such few elements. As Pi says in his story “Life on a lifeboat isn’t much of a life. It is like an end game in chess, a game with few pieces. The elements couldn’t be more simple, nor the stakes higher.” It is the same with Martel’s undulating fable of a book about a boy in a boat with a tiger. A simple story with potentially life altering consequences for it’s readers. As Martel writes, ""The world isn't just the way it is. It is how we understand it, no? And in understanding something, we bring something to it, no?"" Like Schroedinger's cat in the box, the way this book is understood, the way it is perceived affects what it is. There has been some talk that this book will make it’s readers believe in god. I think it’s a question of perspective. To behold this gem of a novel as an adventure of man against the elements (the “dry, yeastless factuality” of what actually happened) is certainly one way to go about it. But to understand this piece to be something indescribable, something godlike, is by far the greater leap of faith.Oh, but worth the leap, if the reader is like that atheist, willing to see the better story."
5916,El Hobbit,Chuck Dixon,4.48,159406,964,Bookdragon Sean ,4,"When I picked this up I was not impressed. I took a fleeting look at the pages and saw artwork that was unglamorous; it was basic and unadorned. The story just looked like a simplified version of the original. So, I stuck it back on my shelf and there it remained for many months. I had not time for it. I didn't want time for it. I looked at it again recently. I then read it through and realised how perfect it is in its simplicity. I was so wrong the first time. I think the movie had altered my perceptions of what this should be like. The movie sacrificed the story for visual effects and action. This graphic novel, in retrospect, didn’t sacrifice anything. It has the essence of the story and the artwork is as it should be; it’s simple and not entirely serious. It's really quite charming in parts. The Artwork: The artwork in this is mainly consistent with the book. As much as I appreciate Martin Freeman’s version, he didn’t quite have the exact appearance of Bilbo. This is only a minor thing. But, in this, Bilbo is as fat and ugly as he should be. Hobbits aren’t supposed to be the most attractive of races. In this he is rendered well, as are the dwarves and Gandalf. My only issue on a character level is Smaug. He just seemed really awkward. In other depictions, such as Allan Lee’s, he is quite splendid and swift. In this he looks old, rusty, and to be quite frank, plump. He just didn’t look much like the mighty dragon that he is; yes, he is old; yes, he is has become lazy, but he shouldn’t look like his wings wouldn’t carry him. The real success here is the scenery. The Shire is luscious and simple; it is homely and basic. I think it’s illustrated perfectly with its wondrous shades of green. This may seem like a simple thing, but it really is a vital thing. It is the crux of the story; it is the anchor that embodies Tolkien’s idea of “a far greener country.” It had to be done right; it had to embody the simple, goodly and unrefined aspect of middle-earth. And it did. The Story:  I’m not going into a great deal of detail here. I’d only be repeating myself. I think I said all I could in my full review of the actual novel. Here's the link in case anyone wants to read me praising the hell out of it: my reviewBut, what I will say is that this brings the story to life. Well, that’s a bad phrase. Tolkien’s story is already alive when you read it. What I mean is that this presents it in a medium that allows you to physically see it rather than just visualise it. Is that better? No I think not. Let me try again: this provides illustrations to aid with an abridged version of the story; it enhances the experience, somewhat, because the artwork is so appropriate. The ending was what really mattered. It was Bilbo’s ending; it is not about the tragic death of a dwarf who went slightly mad, and then redeemed himself; it is not about a boatman who slayed a dragon, and became a renowned hero: it is about a Hobbit. This is Bilbo’s story and no others. It is a story about a fearful Hobbit found the courage to trick a dragon and save his friends. And that all that matters. This evoked the story much more than that heap of shit Peter Jackson shitted out last Christmas. This stayed true to its roots. And the game of riddles was even better. I do seriously recommend this to lovers of Tolkien’s wonderful novel."
5922,The Great Heresies,Hilaire Belloc,4.3,452,44,Ben,5,"Another eye opening history from a very readable writer. Hilaire Belloc was half English, half French, a one time MP and a prolific writer known as ""the man who wrote a library"". Fortunately he did so in small volumes often broken down into self-contained chapters or essays, and wrote them very well, not only in content and structure but also with great wit and precision of language. (The size of his works belie the wealth of fact and insight they contain.) 'The Great Heresies' whilst not a book that by it's title would seem of interest or import to the average person, is by value of it's content enjoyable and informative. The five Heresies which Belloc considors are issues upon which the history of the World hinged, and so in explaining them he explains in part something of the world today, and how and why it is as it is when it could have been extremely different. His considoration of Islam (back in the late 1920's early 1930's) seems almost prescient or prophetic when read today. Though of course it was due to his historical knowlege and clear thinking, and a rejection of the confident attitude of racial and cultural superiority of his time. He clearly predicted that Islam would once again gain in strength and influence to be an important force in the world. Adam Shaw's earlier review, though it could be said to be mostly true is misleading and less than helpfull. Yes Hilaire Belloc was Catholic, and very proud of the fact. He wrote as a Catholic, not hiding his bias and making no false claims to being impartial or without prior opinion, thus allowing all his readers to follow his thoughts with open eyes and a questioning mind. He was not afraid of holding a position and defending it, not afraid of debate, as his life well shows. If you are bigotted enough not to read him because of his Faith he himself would have been glad you have nothing to do with him. He was angry about many things as any rational man or woman who truely looks at the world around them will be, whatever time they live in. He was especially angry about the unadmitted and unacknowledged anti-Catholic bias in the officailly accepted Whig version of History. So much of his Historical work was (and still is) a reply to it from someone on the other side of the debate about what happened in the past to bring us to the present, and how and why. Bare in mind whilst reading that he was a man of his time, before political correctness and the timidity of openly declared personal opinion which it has been one of it's fruits. Though free of many of the prejudices of his day, like anyone he was not free of them all, remember; nor are you. Also remember that Catholic enfranchisement was an issue not so far in the past as it is today and was one on which people had very strong views. If i have not been clear above, i clearly state now that I thoroughly recommend this book."
7396,Pride And Joy,Dee Williams,4.37,222,1,Tracey,4,"I really enjoyed this book. It starts in 1934 in London, and the main character is Mary Harris. Mary lives with her mother, Sarah, her stepfather Ted, and her 4 year old half brother, Eddie who isn't like other children his age. The story begins slowly and I can't say that I was gripped but I did want to find out more, especially about little Eddie. Then as the story developed the book changed for me from a pleasant read to a brilliant story that was hard to put down. It has plenty of mystery, and also family troubles, good friendships and a bit of romance, what more could you want?"
7397,The Baby Boon: How Family-Friendly America Cheats the Childless,Elinor Burkett,3.58,88,11,Joellyn,5,"This book was written back in I think 2000 and what it has to say applies today. I do think an updated/follow-up would be welcomed.This is a book that should be read by everyone, if you have kids or not. I believe it is a real eye opener as to how Corporate America works these days to protect families (but often leaving the lower income out of the equation) sometimes at the expense of those who do not have children (either by choice, circumstances, or health reasons), and also how our Government (both Federal and State) contribute to the entitlement mentality that has evolved over the years.I think everyone at one time or another (or more frequently) has experienced the scenario of being the one asked to stay late, pick up the slack, work the weekend/holiday, change a vacation date, etc. while the co-worker with children basically makes their own hours for daycare pick-ups/soccer practice/etc., is home with a sick child at any given moment, ""works from home"" during school vacations/early dismissals, and even bring the children into work where there is often disruption to others (but I do appreciate those individuals who recognize the workplace and their children are well behaved so there is no disruption). The book also demonstrates how those individuals who are parents by choice and are considered middle class or above get plenty of tax incentives and corporate benefits that lower income families do not receive and in most cases should and perhaps reduce the # on welfare. Meanwhile those without children must contribute to all and get virtually no breaks.As I have heard before, having children is a choice not a right or a duty. And if you choose to have a child that shouldn't mean you get rewarded or treated differently (especially in the workplace) often at the expense of those individuals who choose not to have a child or are unable."

2586,Sun Tzu and the Art of Business: Six Strategic Principles for Managers,Sun Tzu,3.77,128,16,Erwin,5,"At least he didn't name this ""The Art of War for Business""...It's a very thoughtful book though. I have read a few versions of the Art of War, and have been doing business in Asia for 10 years now, but this helped me make some connections between Sun Tzu's battle field and the market that I didn't make earlier.The goal is to win without fighting.We must attack where the enemy is not.Seriously, if your responsible for business strategy, you should read this. In spite of the cheesy title and cover, the author is very sharp. Every bit as valid in 2014 as when it was written almost 20 years ago.Now if we can just change Sun-Tzu to Sunzi...

The recipes in this book comprise one paragraph and there's nothing terribly fancy about any of them. It picks a subject and gives you 50 ways to deal with it, all of which are simple. Now, there's no way I'm going to try anything in the fifty ways to love your liver section. Frankly, to my palate, there is no way. However when you find yourself with another can of tuna and you're more than a little tired of tuna noodle casserole, then this book will have an easy to execute suggestion for you to try. Some of the sections are 50 ways to top spaghetti, fifty marinades, fifty ways to clean out the refrigerator and so on."

Turn Your Ideas into Epidemics by Helping Your Customers Do the Marketing thing for You.,Seth Godin,3.96,3535,81,Sue Cartwright,4,"‘The primary goal of a product or service is not just to satisfy the needs of one user. It has to deliver so much wow, be so cool, so neat and so productive, that the user tells five of their friends.’ They key message when it comes to building a virus-worthy cool product or service, identifying a ‘hive’ and promoting an idea, is the importance of WORDS. Words matter because they are how you start an ideavirus. You have to make it easy for people to ‘get it’ with one glimpse of your website or one phrase in your book review. The words you use have to make them want it – now and forever. ‘One of the key elements in launching an ideavirus is concentrating the message. If just 15% of a group is excited about it, it’s not enough. You only win when you totally dominate and amaze the group you’ve targeted. That’s why focusing obsessively on a niche is what successful idea merchants do.’In this book, Seth explains how the customer should be placed at the centre of marketing and how to harness the contagious power of information through the art of successful communication."
2612,The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference,Malcolm Gladwell,3.92,509367,11002,Nick,4,"This book is fascinating and I was disappointed to read that many other readers didn't think so. So here's my response. I think those readers are approaching this book the wrong the way when they critisize Gladwell for his inability to prove his points thoroughly. Sure, Gladwell could have dotted every i and crossed every t and shown every counter-example to the theories he's proposing. There's a word for the books that accomplish that: BORING. Gladwell is a storyteller and he knows how to keep the reader involved. By going into too much detail, he would lose his audience. Hopefully the reader who isn't convinced entirely can go into further detail by reading Gladwell's sources which are exhaustively referenced in the back of the book. Another criticism is that Gladwell doesn't come to a specific point or that his points are hazy (this was probably more true with ""Blink""). I almost want to say ""who cares?"" This book and ""Blink"" are veritable digests of the latest advances in psychology and sociology. So what if the overarching idea of the book is loose? You have now understood countless fascinating anecdotes which you can reconstruct in your own way. It is Gladwell's loose structure that allows him to connect these disparate dots in a story that you can digest, and despite the accusations that he is not precise about his overall thesis, the individual incidents are very well explained. I love knowing the differences between Sesame Street and Blue's Clues and the differences between an adult's and a child's cognitive capabilities. Would I have read an entire book devoted solely to that? Probably not, but I was happy to read a chapter devoted to it, and a very well-written one at that.Perhaps I approach non-fiction in a different way than most--and I will admit that I'm fascinated by almost any new, dramatically different idea about any subject, regardless of whether or not I believe it to be true--but I think that people who go into this book seeking a different way of thinking about the world around us, macro & microcosmically, will enjoy themselves. Those who go into the book seeking to be convinced beyond doubt that that way of thinking is the correct way, will not."

The idea for this book is fantastic, he wants us to understand that you don't have to be a professional chef with a expensive larder to make great food. He does this by cooking with amazing chefs, having them make an amazing recipe (Lamb 6 ways) and then making a home style version that still has the soul of the original dish.

Sabato traces the rise of watchdog journalism as it became junkdog/wolfpack journalism. Using interviews with hundreds of journalists and case studies of key moments in the 1988 and 1992 elections, he ultimately derives a set of clear consequences (mistrust of media, discouragement of potential candidates, loss of electoral choice, illusion that all politicians are crooks) and reforms (make a clear distinction between public and private lives, report only on those private issues that might affect public life, create more internal supervision of media, have politicians focus on issues and stop using surrogates in media)."
1685,The Enchiridion on Faith Hope and Love (Augustine Series 1),Augustine of Hippo,3.98,384,34,Brent McCulley,4,"Some solid gems in this, a classic primer from Augustine himself on his mature thought. The Enchiridion lays out Augustine's view on original sin, the fall of man (massa damnata), predestination, the resurrection and more. I have definitely stored most all this information in the back of my head.Interesting highlights is that even in his maturity and old age, the creationisn / traducianism debate still perplexed him, and he wavered. His understanding of the causes of predestination to life and damnation seem to be God's free mercy (life), God's justice as proximate cause vis-à-vis the sinfulness of man for those unto death (damnation). From what I have read in historical dogma, he does not probe this further, as we would have to wait until Calvin to explore the ""hidden inscrutable decrees."" Amazing stuff."

Read a page or two and you get that feeling that you have achieve your daily quota of prayers. St. Augustine poured his heart out in each page of his memoir. Something that is inspiring for me to ask myself those questions he threw out to God and reflect on those thoughts that he put on the pages.There are so many quotes that I would like to capture here but if I do that, I think I will be quoting half of the book. Most of them are in long and winding sentences but this first paragraph of Book 11 is my favorite: 
  Is it possible, lord, that, since you are in eternity, you are ignorant of what I am saying to you? Or, do you see in time an event at the time it occurs? If not, then why am I recounting such a tale of things to you? Certainly not in order to acquiant you with them through me; but, instead, that through them I may stir up my own love and the love of my readers toward you, so that all may say, ""Great is the lord and greatly to be praised."" I have said this before and will say it again. For love of your love I do it. So also we pray - and yet truth tells us, ""Your father knows want things you need before you ask him."" Consequently, we lay bare our feelings before you, so that, through our confessing to you our plight and your mercies towards us, you may go on to free us altogether, as you have already begun; and so that we may cease to be wretched in ourselves and blessed in you - since you have called us to be poor in spirit, meek, mourners, hungering and athirst for righteousness, merciful and pure in heart.""

Absolutely,3,"I never dreamed that one day I would finished reading a 300-page memoir written by a ancient Catholic saint. See, how many saints who lived during the first millennium have written himself a memoir?I twice tried to read The Holy Bible (once in English and once in Tagalog) from cover to cover but failed. I just got distracted by too many details and hard-to-remember names and ancient places and I could not appreciate what were all those characters are doing. Excuses, excuses. They say that reading The Holy Bible needs the Holy Spirit to come to you so that it will be the spirit who will whisper the words to your ears so that you will understand the word of God. Maybe the spirit is still contemplating whether a sinner like me is worth his time and effort. Until I came to this memoir. Written by a self-confessed sinner who is now considered one of the most important figures in the development of Western Christianity: Saint Augustine (latin word for church father)of Hippo (354-430) It took me more than 4 weeks to finish this book. Not a straight read. It is impossible to do that. The memoir is like a letter of St. Augustine to God and in the letter, he is conversing and confessing. He pours out his thoughts, his doubts, his questions. Some of those are funny (based on what we all know now with the advances in science and technology). He tells Him his weaknesses, what wrongs he has done to others. His sins in thoughts, in words, in actions.Reading it is like uttering a prayer. Read a page or two and you get that feeling that you have achieve your daily quota of prayers. St. Augustine poured his heart out in each page of his memoir. Something that is inspiring for me to ask myself those questions he threw out to God and reflect on those thoughts that he put on the pages.There are so many quotes that I would like to capture here but if I do that, I think I will be quoting half of the book. Most of them are in long and winding sentences but this first paragraph of Book 11 is my favorite: 
  Is it possible, lord, that, since you are in eternity, you are ignorant of what I am saying to you? Or, do you see in time an event at the time it occurs? If not, then why am I recounting such a tale of things to you? Certainly not in order to acquiant you with them through me; but, instead, that through them I may stir up my own love and the love of my readers toward you, so that all may say, ""Great is the lord and greatly to be praised."" I have said this before and will say it again. For love of your love I do it. So also we pray - and yet truth tells us, ""Your father knows want things you need before you ask him."" Consequently, we lay bare our feelings before you, so that, through our confessing to you our plight and your mercies towards us, you may go on to free us altogether, as you have already begun; and so that we may cease to be wretched in ourselves and blessed in you - since you have called us to be poor in spirit, meek, mourners, hungering and athirst for righteousness, merciful and pure in heart.""
Now, I have to give The Holy Bible another try. I could not have finished this whole book and pointed that beautiful part if there was no Holy Spirit upon me. Oh ye of little faith."
1163,Monkey Business,Wallace Edwards,4.2,124,30,D'Anne,4,"This book is awesome. Each page features a literal illustration of an English idiom, like ""monkey business"" or ""rise to the occassion"" or ""sweet tooth."" And every illustration includes a monkey, usually quite well hidden. There is so much to look at in every illustration. Between that and wrapping their little brains around idiomatic expressions they've probably heard but never thought about before, this isn't a book kids will get bored with any time soon. Oh, and it features a cricket named Gavin (illustrating ""snug as a bug in a rug"")."
1162,Monkey Business: Swinging Through the Wall Street Jungle,John Rolfe,3.9,3613,121,TS Chan,3,"A conversation with some juniors over lunch today reminded me of this book which I've read a long time ago when I landed myself into a front-line banking role. Strangely enough, it was my boss then who loaned this book to me.A brutally honest and startlingly eye-opening account, I'll recommend any newbie into the investment banking world to read this book. The landscape of investment banking has changed a lot since the Lehman's crash in 2008. But there are enough similarities to be drawn on what the life of an associate is like working in an investment bank, or even the investment banking division of a commercial bank. Quite fun to read but also quite sobering (and a bit offputting) at the same time. "
1166,"Hank the Cowdog and Monkey Business (Hank the Cowdog, #14)",John R. Erickson,4.07,498,18,Jared Burton,3,"Erickson, John. Hank the Cowdog and Monkey Business. New York: Penguin Group, 1990.Genre - Fiction - Talking Dogs	This book is about two dogs, Hank, which is the dong in charge of the ranch, and Drover, which is his lazy, half-witted sidekick. The text itself is very amusing. There are tons of word plays on every page that leave the reader thinking about what was really just said. For example when they're getting ready to chase rabbits, the other says ""oh rats!"" as in he's complaining, and the other corrects ""not rats, rabbits."" Throughout the book there are even more less obvious ones and even some that can be kind of twisted. My favorite is when Drover is told to move to the left, he moves right, and Hank says no, he moved the wrong way, move left, right is wrong. The story is about these dogs who seem to be very intelligent and rational but in reality have the intelligence of a normal dumb dog. Which to a child could be very amusing.	The book is more focused on being amusing more than anything. However there are a lot of word plays that can help children learn the abnormalities of language. The book also leaves room for an adult reader to be very interactive with children listening. For example, everything that the two dogs have to figure out the kids could guess what they must do before reading what they actually did. "
1164,Monkey Business: True Story of the Scopes Trial,Marvin N. Olasky,3.17,23,7,Tim Chavel,4,"This is an excellent book not only about the Scopes' Trail but about the theory of evolution. One of the authors, Marvin Olasky, is the editor of the newsweekly, World. He is also one of our greatest Christian thinkers. If you are interested in learning more about the Scopes trial or about the theory of evolution this is the book for you. As you may know there were two famous lawyers involved in the trial, Clarence Darrow and William Jennings Bryan. The trial took place in Dayton, TN. The college Bryan helped start in Dayton bears his name and I have been privileged to visit. A couple of quotes from the book to get you interested:Bryan summarized a position that would sound strangely familiar to creationists eighty years later:Science is a magnificent material force, but it is not a teacher of morals. It can perfect machinery, but it adds no moral restraints to protect society from the misuse of the machine. It can also build gigantic intellectual ships, but it constructs no moral rudders for the control of storm-tossed human vessels. It not only fails to supply the spiritual element needed but some of its unproven hypotheses rob the ship of its compass and thus endangers its cargo ....The world needs a Savior more than it ever did before, and there is only one Name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved. It is this Name that evolution degrades, for, carried to its logical conclusion, it robs Christ of the glory of a virgin birth, of the majesty of His deity and mission and of the triumph of His resurrection .... p. 171Perhaps [Phillip E.] Johnson's most dramatic conclusion in Darwin on Trial was that the fossil record showed none of the intermediate steps animals would have taken if they evolved incrementally over the ages. Two examples he and others returned to time and again were the wing and the eye. These structures are complex and highly specialized. If they evolved from a single cell, a fossil record (at least with the wing) would be expected to show a primitive sort of limb that evolved over many years. The fossil record shows just the opposite: every example of a fossilized wing is fully developed and functional. p. 188In writing about the eye, Richard Dawkins, author of The Blind Watchmaker, believed, ""An ancient animal with 5 percent of an eye might indeed have used it for something other than sight, but it seems to me as likely that it used it for 5 percent vision."" Responding in Darwin on Trial, Johnson wrote, ""The fallacy in that argument is that '5 percent of an eye' is not the same as '5 percent of normal vision.' For an animal to have any useful vision at all, many complex parts must be working together. Even a complete eye is useless unless it belongs to a creature with the mental and neural capacity to make use of the information by doing something that furthers survival or reproduction.""Furthermore, today the nautilus with its primitive pinhole eye and the eagle with its incredible accuracy of sight exist side by side. The nautilus eye has never evolved into something more complex, and the eagle eye shows no signs of an earlier, simpler form. One is not a refinement of the other because they operate in completely different ways. How could so complex an organ as the eye be preserved by natural selection if it was useless until completely evolved? Why would it have evolved in the first place? pp. 188-189Darwin's most formidable opponents were not clergymen but fossil experts. p. 189Darwin admitted that for his theory to be true, ""the number of intermediate and transitional links, between all living and extinct species, must have been inconceivably great."" To Johnson this meant that rocks should be full of ""fossil evidence of transitional forms."" What scientists have discovered instead is that species appeared fully formed in the fossil record. p. 189A metaphor by Fred Hoyle has become famous because it vividly conveys the magnitude of the problem: that a living organism emerged by chance from a prebiotic soup is about as likely as that ""a tornado sweeping through a junkyard might assemble a Boeing 747."" p. 191President George W. Bush was the first president in years to declare his Christianity openly. When asked at a news conference whether he asked his father, former president George H.W. Bush, for advice. ""You know, he is the wrong father to appeal to in terms of strength,"" the president reportedly said. ""There is a higher Father that I appeal to."" p. 231At least in theory, Christians should be less likely than others to bow to any human authority. Christians obey a higher authority and are taught by the Bible not to put their trust in princes.Christians should be political skeptics in relation to Washington orthodoxy and strict constructionists concerning both the Bible and the Constitution. Most important, Christians must read for themselves what the Bible says about Christianity, letting Scripture - and not those with axes to grind - interpret Scripture. Christians must also read the Constitution to see what the nation agreed to in 1787 and 1788, and how the nation has changed since through the amendment process, not take what today's judges say it is.The founders of the United States admired Sir Henry Blackstone and his Commentaries on the Law of England. The admiration produced a strong connection between the American Constitution and the Declaration of Independence and Blackstone's commentaries on law. Foremost among them was the conviction that the law came from God. Blackstone wrote:Man, considered as a creature, must necessarily be subject to the laws of his creator, for he is entirely a dependent being .... And consequently as a man depends absolutely on his maker for everything, it is necessary that he should in all points conform to his maker's will. This will of his maker is called the law of nature. For God, when He created matter, and endued it with a principle of mobility, established certain rules for the perpetual direction of that motion; so, when he created man, and endued him with freewill to conduct himself in all parts of life, he laid down certain immutable laws of human nature, whereby that freewill is in some degree regulated and restrained, and gave him also the faculty of reason to discover the purpose of these laws. pp. 236-237A little history clarifies the point. Nine of the original thirteen colonies had tax-supported churches, all of which discriminated against Baptists. John Leland, the leading Baptist evangelist in the colonies, opposed ratification of the U.S. Constitution because he was afraid it would lead to a tax-supported national church. Madison promised him that if he would support ratification, Madison would introduce an amendment assuring no national church would be established.Years later on New Year's Day, 1802, after Leland made a courtesy call on President Thomas Jefferson, Jefferson wrote to the Danbury Baptist Association in Connecticutt: ""Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legislative powers of government reach actions only, and not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should 'make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,' thus building a wall of separation between Church and State.""His point clearly is that Congress should stay out of religious matters of conscience. But he said nothing about separating God from government. Two days after Leland's visit, Jefferson attended a worship service in the House of Representatives with Leland preaching. Jefferson's point that government ought to stay out of religion was upheld into the middle of the twentieth century by Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart, who said, ""What our Constitution indispensably protects is the freedom of each of us, be Jew or Agnostic, Christian or Atheist, Buddhist or free thinker, to believe or disbelieve, to worship or not to worship, to pray or keep silent, according to his own conscience, uncoerced and unrestrained by the government.""As Richard Land notes in For Faith and Family, ""The First Amendment was never intended to keep religion out of public policy, but to keep government out of religion."" pp. 240-241"
1161,Of Permanent Value : The Story of Warren Buffett/Monster Millennium Edition,Andrew Kilpatrick,3.93,134,5,Joselito Honestly and Brilliantly,3,"I read this many years ago.In fact my notes at its inside front cover says I bought my copy way back 1 December 2004. The book marker I used was a souvenir from the ordination to priesthood of one Ricci Pajarillo on 10 June 2000 and the tip which stuck out from the book is brown and brittle with age. It is thick and heavy, more than a thousand pages. It seems to reaffirm the pointlessness of reading considering the limitations of human memory. I must have spent weeks reading this and now what do I remember of it? Only these:1. Warren Buffett was at some time the richest man in the world;2. He started young. I'm no longer sure, but I think when he was a small boy he started by collecting and selling bottles;3. He's humble and not ostentatious. He still lives in the same old house he grew up in. He still uses his old car;4. He is considered a genius in investing (he seems to buy stocks and never sell--as far as I recall);5. He is from Omaha, and he is called the Oracle of Omaha because he has the rare knack of predicting which stocks will rise in the future; and6. His favorite are steaks and hamburgers and cherry Coke ( I remember thirsting for cherry Coke but it is not sold here in our country and I wondered how he had grown old, healthy, with such an unhealthy diet).Finally I've reviewed it. Now I can give this copy away."
4877,Ultima Parada: Matrimonio,Emma Darcy,3.23,43,5,KC,3,"This was a unique romance because of the setting and the hero's occupation. (view spoiler)[China and explosives expert, respectively. (hide spoiler)] It was a fun read as well, with good chemistry between the protagonists.I thought Dan was wonderful. His relationship with his adopted child was so sweet and cute. And he displayed true heroism as well in the latter portion of the book, kicking some serious butt like a star in an action movie. (view spoiler)[He rescued Jayne who'd been kidnapped and stashed on a private jet by a wealthy admirer. (hide spoiler)]Jayne was a likable, strong-willed heroine. I liked how she was not consumed by her career even though it was important to her. Having fun is as important as working hard IMO.I also liked how Dan and Jayne were celibate during their estrangement (at least that's what I recall). I hate it when the married hero is unfaithful to the heroine while apart, especially if the marriage has been consummated.The conflict between Jayne and Dan was believable. But like many issues in Romancelandia, their separation could have been prevented with a good talk. This discussion finally occurred after their reunion and they're able to repair their marriage."
6501,La Dieta De Las 3 Horas,Jorge Cruise,3.38,143,19,Chelsea,3,"This book emphasizes eating every 3 hours. This is because after 3 hours your body goes into starvation mode and takes lean muscle tissue for energy instead of fat. It also has a plan to eat 400 calories for 3 meals, and 100 for 2 snacks, and 50 for a treat at the end of the day. No food is off limits! He suggested to eat the ""3 hour plate"" which consists of half the plate of vegetables (fruit for breakfast) the equivalent of 3 DVD cases. One fourth the plate of carbohydrates the equivalent of a Rubik's cube, and the other fourth of the plate with protein the equivalent of a deck of cards. By using this system he says you'll lose 2 pounds every week. Very informative and convincing."
8032,Mr. Jelly and the Pirates,Roger Hargreaves,3.8,89,10,Godzilla,3,"An allegory for the paranoia of our times? A simple tale for kids?Maybe a mixture of both.Mr Jelly plucks up the courage to travel to the seaside, in the face of his fear of everything. Is there a phobia for everything? Something to Google later. In the real world is this exploring our fear of travel post 9/11?Mr Lazy offering to help safeguard Mr Jelly seems nonsensical, but in this parallel story does Mr Lazy represent the Security Services? Seemingly lazing around rather than preventing further atrocities...Mr Jelly's paranoia eventually rubs off on everyone, causing chaos.A message for our times: don't overreact?My kids liked it, although they couldn't fathom how such ineffectual pirates existed!"
6505,Prozac Nation,Elizabeth Wurtzel,3.58,47319,1563,tee,4,"Haha, so many people hate her for being so self-absorbed and whiney and I agree, she is - but I love her for it. I think it's honest; it's a fair depiction of what a lot of people feel when they're depressed and I thought it was powerfully written. Maybe I need to read it again now that I'm older but I do remember loving it several years ago. I'd like to add that there's another review on this website that slams this book for being whiny and that Wurtzel should 'just get over it' because there's people out there who have suffered more and are more entitled to being in emotional pain than she is. Er, wrong. Pain isn't something that is on a scale, you can't compare pain between people. The reviewer implies that depression and mental illness isn't real pain and that you have to be a war victim to know what real pain is. Bullshit. I've suffered from anxiety and depression and I've also suffered 'real' trauma as well and I'd give up everything to not have to deal with depression or anxiety ever again. Suffering from mental illness does not equate to *just* being whiny, self-pitying or attention seeking; it may look like that's all depressed people are on the outside but those things are just the scabs on a deeper, festering wound. You can't often tell that someone has cancer just by looking at them and you can't assume how they feel so why would being mentally ill be any different? If a cancer patient ""whined"" about how rough they were feeling you'd hardly berate them for doing so. Being stoic might be an admirable quality to some but to others, the pain that can be caused by psychic anguish is unbearable and they can't help but be visibly distressed, to speak of their discomfort, to ask for help or attention.I myself have never experienced anything worse and keeping quiet about my issues only led me straight to almost killing myself.Also, most people don't become drug addicts or alcoholics for the ~glamour~. These are real problems, just as real as anything else going on out there. Sure, some people that suffer from these problems may be privileged people. They may have, from what looks from the outside, to be 'easy' good lives. Doesn't change how fucking devastating mental illness can be. It's too variable to be able to compare one person's experience to another's. Whether you think Wurtzel herself is self-indulgent, whiny or attention-seeking is debatable. People with depression can read that way. People with depression can be downright unbearable but it's often not their fault. I don't know, it's so complicated. "

57,A Changeling for All Seasons,Angela Knight,3.73,159,4,Judy & Marianne from Long and Short Reviews,3,"With ten stories from various authors and genres I'm betting you'll find at least something you like in A Changeling For All Seasons, and may even discover a few things you didn’t realize you enjoyed until now. I know I did. Angela Knight - A Vampire Christmas Picture walking into your home feeling on top of the world knowing your sexy fiancé is waiting with open arms. Only you open the door and instead of the loving man you expected you get a bloodthirsty creature. This is exactly what happens to Amelia. She had no idea what happened, she only knew was that life would never be normal again. I really did enjoy this story because you frequently read about falling in love with a supernatural, but it is rare to read about a character having someone they love changing and having to choose whether to leave them or accept them. One thing I did wish I got more of was David's POV. It was hard to follow the relationship development because I just didn’t know enough about his character to understand his actions. In the end though everything worked itself out and Amelia may not have ended up with the life she dreamed of, but she got one equally rewarding. Sahara Kelly - A Christmas Pageant Joey and Marty sitting in a tree... but they are doing way more that kissing. I really enjoyed this story. It played nicely off of a schoolboy fantasy, which most readers can appreciate. Marty desperately needed change to get past the rut in his life, and Joey definitely changed things for him. All he has to do is get her out of that skimpy outfit and into his bed. Judy Mays - Jingle Balls With a name like Jingle Balls this story has got to be good! Then I started reading it and thought to myself “Uh oh, this is some cheesy play off of Christmas”. Well I should have gone with my original thought because turns out it was good. By the time they made it to the club scene I was sold. The relationship development while a little slow to start but after a while really drew me in. Richard and Jessica definitely do complement each other well including both of their tempers. It seems both characters can go off at any given moment so I know their relationship will be one interesting ride. And yes I even enjoyed the cheesy play off of Christmas. Marteeka Karland - Sealed With A Kiss We have moved from Christmas to Valentine’s Day. I have to admit I have mix feeling about this story. The relationship develop for me was good, but the overall plot of the story just seemed as if it was missing something. I would have liked just a little more excitement or conflict. I prefer a more complex plot, but the relationship itself was good. I liked that it was almost a competition between Marie and Daxon on who could seduce who first. Plus in this relationship you can see the emotional development without being told about it, which I liked. All-in-all it was a story I enjoyed reading. Kate Douglas - My Valentine Ginny is my favorite character within this anthology so far. She suffered greatly in her life and deserved a shot at happiness. Her happiness is in the form of St. Valentine and, as appropriate to the holiday, he sweeps her off her feet and warms her heart and soul in an attempt to show her what life and living should be. This is a short story I can see myself reading over again and still getting that warm fuzzy feeling in my heart every time. Shelby Morgen – Changeling Now it's time for St. Patrick’s day and where better to celebrate than Ireland! This story was an interesting one since we start with Michael, a none believer in all things magical, but drunk enough to explore anyway. I liked the way the relationship between Arien and Michael unraveled especially the twist of them being together. One thing I was disappointed by was the end of the story. I would have liked to have seen a more definitive conclusion, but regardless, I consider this another lovely story. Willa Okati - Elven Enchantment I absolutely adored this story. Ciara had some crappy luck with men until she walks into a bar. Even though there was a band the real show was the two guys who couldn’t keep their hands off each other -- a far better show, and Ciara thought so, too. Even more fun was when Seanan and Ardal invite Ciara for a night of unimaginable pleasure. Who wouldn't jump at the change to join Blondie and Dark & Delicious? Everything about this story was perfect from beginning to end, and I would love to see more of these lovable characters. Kate Hill - Jolene's Pooka Another great story riveted with myth and lore. Larkin is really the stand out character in this story. Athough he came off a little too arrogant and dominant for me, knowing what he is really helps me understand why he acts that way. Apparently it is just what Jolene needs because she falls into his bed, and refuses to leave once she realized how much fun it was. I don't know if the legend of the pooka is true, but I'm sold and would love for one to show up at in front of my house. I wonder if they travel to the city? Lacey Savage - Chemistry to Burn While the beginning of this story confused me a bit I quickly figured out what was going on. Some men will go to any length to get a girl's attention. Griffin is no exception; he refused to play second fiddle to Angelina’s research so he came up with an infallible plan to fix that problem. But he soon realized he may have made a big mistake. I actually liked Griffin once I got to know him, he isn’t as bad of a guy that Angelina thought he was. Griffin, go get your girl and refuse to accept no for an answer! Shelby Morgen - Troll Under The Bridge This story was short enough the characters were able to be fairly anonymous, only going by Troll and Cop. I think this was a nice little encounter at the end of this anthology. The twist at the end made it interesting. This was the shortest story within the anthology so there really wasn’t room for error and the author made sure there were none. All in all I would have to say this was good anthology. I think that it had a nice theme that it continued from beginning to end and while each story was different they complemented each other. As a paranormal erotica fan I was able to read about fairies, shifters, trolls, vampires and other creatures. I discovered some new authors that I would love to read more stories by, which is always a plus and one of the reasons I have always enjoyed anthologies. So I would say, go ahead and read this anthology -- you might be surprised by the creatures you bump into. Originally posted at http://whippedcream2.blogspot.com/201..."
1839,"Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies",Jared Diamond,4,188056,8009,Molly,1,"This is what happens when you take an intelligent person, and casually make a few mentions of a field of study they have no knowledge of.Mr. Diamond, NOT an anthropologist, takes Marvin Harris' theory of cultural materialism and uses it to explain everything in life, history, and the current state of the world.Materialism is a way of looking at human culture which, for lack of a better way to explain it easily here, says that people's material needs and goods determine behavior and culture. For instance Jews stopped eating pigs because it became so costly to feed pigs they themselves were starving.On the surface, materialism seems very logical. Like any theory it has to be at least somewhat probable sounding, and since people are used to thinking of life, these days, in terms of materialistic values already, Harris' theory sounds logical and likely very often.But like every other time you attempt to explain everything that ever happened in the history of man with one theory, this falls desperately short of reality. Materialism is likely ONLY when coupled, sensibly, with other theories and, need I say it, actual PROOF, of which Diamond has little.As an exercise in materialist theory this book is magnificent. I would recommend this book ONLY to people in Anthropology with a great understanding of theory, less educated or unwarned people might think this book is fact rather than an exercise in speculation. As an explanation of why the world is the way it is, it is an utter and complete failure."
3736,Redburn,Herman Melville,3.6,543,54,Darwin8u,3," “For the scene of suffering is a scene of joy when the suffering is past; and the silent reminiscence of hardships departed is sweeter than the presence of delight.” ― Herman Melville, RedburnIt must be awful as a writer to dash off a novel for money or tobacco in a couple of weeks and have it praised, but see your earlier serious novel (Mardi) panned, and your later novel (Moby-Dick) under-appreciated until years after your death. That is the genius of a select group of writers -- they are destined to exist in this weird space between art and the public. Perhaps the strong bitter of Melville's art was just too early and too strange for the public, but they WERE ready for his swipes.If you are into literature of the sea (The Sea Wolf, The Pilot, Captains Courageous, etc.,) or you are just into Melville, you will want to read this. If, however, this is your first Melville, I'd stick with Moby-Dick."
6976,The Mermaid Chair,Sue Monk Kidd,3.1,66121,5936,Spudsie,1,"I did not like this book. That’s not entirely accurate. I loved the religious themes that ran through this book, I loved the stories of growing up on an island, I loved the Mermaid aspect of this story.So why the rating of “did not like?” I’m really tired of stories where the lead character decides they need to drastically change their life. Then they run off through either some decision they consciously make or through some twist of fate (as in this case) to “find” themselves. While finding themselves they find (surprise!) a new love interest. At this point they find themselves madly and inexplicably in LOVE with someone they met 10 minutes ago. They decide to walk away from a secure (albeit bland) life and a stable (albeit ordinary) lover/spouse who has given them a lifelong commitment.After making the decision to leave the said stable relationship the lead character always (and I mean ALWAYS) manages to convince themselves (and the reader) that it isn’t just “lust” that draws them into this new relationship—oh no, it’s TRUE LOVE. This new person is the person they were meant to be with.So they plunge into this new relationship (often without ending the first one) with great bliss. Headlong into the great unknown. Romping around, rolling in the hay, having a grand ole time convinced they are in love and life will be like this for the rest of their days. Nothing could be better. Nothing could end this bliss. This is what life is meant to be.And then……yep. Then another plot twist either separates the two new lovers, or throws the lead character back into the path of the stable relationship.And lo and behold……it turns out the new relationship isn’t all that great. And the first relationship is what they really need. (Smacks head loudly….d’oh!)And now our beloved lead character leaves the new-found love and goes back to the first love.And they live happily-ever-after.I’m really tired of authors using this device/plot. Really tired of it. I feel it cheapens the importance of marriage or a committed relationship, and makes the lead character (typically a woman) look naive and well, let’s be honest, like an idiot. (Okay…that’s overly harsh. It makes the woman look less than insightful at best.) Let’s call a spade a spade. The lead character wanted to have a steamy affair with their new-found love interest. And they felt guilty because they were already married. So they convinced themselves that they were at a point in their life where they needed to change and they found this amazing new person who could love who they now are. Why not just admit they want to have an affair and damn the consequences? At least have the decency to be honest with themselves and the reader about it. Sigh. Time to step off my soap box.I suppose this book hit me at just the wrong moment. There were parts I loved. But the overall plot frustrates me. It presents a stereo-type of women that doesn’t sit well with me. It is possible to “find” yourself while still honoring your commitments and keeping your integrity intact. And that’s a plot line I’d like to see more of!"
351372,A Journey to the Rivers: Justice for Serbia,Peter Handke,3.66,61,2,Jacques le fataliste et son maître,5,"Giustizia per la realtà, più che giustizia per la Serbia, mi pare lo spazio che Handke tenta di circoscrivere con questo suo piccolo testo. Non nel senso che nell’orrore jugoslavo una diversa attribuzione delle responsabilità e delle colpe sia incontestabile, sia una “realtà” mistificata – bensì con l’intenzione di rendere giustizia a una realtà che i giudizi, le generalizzazioni, l’esigenza – spesso in buona fede; altre volte, a suo dire, no – di semplificare per comprendere e agire maltrattano, cancellano. È il grande flusso di notizie che debordano dai giornali e dalla televisione che Handke sottopone a critica, stigmatizzandone la potenza deformante: il modo in cui la realtà viene distorta dalle inquadrature, dai fermo-immagine, da titoli e sottotitoli, dai nuovi epiteti formulari, dai ritmi e dalle proporzioni con cui le notizie sono rilasciate ecc. «Nulla contro alcuni giornalisti – più che rivelatori – scopritori sul luogo (o meglio ancora: implicati nel luogo e negli uomini del luogo), viva questi diversi esploratori sul campo! Parecchio invece contro le bande di mestatori a distanza che confondono la loro professione di scrittori con quella di un giudice o addirittura col ruolo di un demagogo, e pestando attraverso gli anni sempre nello stesso mortaio di parole e di immagini, dal palco su cui pontificano all’estero sono, a modo loro, mastini di guerra altrettanto feroci di quelli sul campo di battaglia» (p. 75). L’occhio puntato sul “luogo”, la realtà da scoprire, nelle sue minime articolazioni: «villaggi fittamente concatenati, formati da fattorie dalla pianta sempre complessa, per così dire piccoli villaggi all’interno del grande villaggio» (p. 40); «e le orde di corvi sempre più fitte sull’asfalto in genere deserto, a proposito dei quali il mio compagno di viaggio disse poi com’è strano che tra i corvi ci sia ogni volta mescolata una gazza – proprio quando volevo attirare la sua attenzione appunto su questo» (p. 66). La realtà si rivela dietro apparenze semplificanti: è il particolare che rompe l’uniformità. È necessario porsi in ascolto per coglierlo, al fine di percepire la varietà, di penetrare all’interno di ciò che è complesso: nel villaggio, altri villaggi; la gazza in mezzo ai corvi. L’obiettivo è dissolvere le incrostazioni di pregiudizi, strappare le etichette, bloccare le conclusioni naturali – che “naturali” non sono, ma frutto di condizionamenti o di un immaginario vecchio di secoli: «poi figure d’uomini incuranti delle intemperie, con addosso specie di uniformi, dappertutto sulle strade di confine, nelle locande di confine, e senza volerlo noi, anche Zarko che ci aveva di nuovo raggiunto dopo la notte presso la sua occasionale famiglia, vedevamo in loro naturalmente (?) dei killer paramilitari, basta guardare quegli occhi, “esperti di uccisioni”» (pp. 59-60); «la guardia di confine con il suo sguardo da tiratore – o non era piuttosto una tristezza come inguaribile, anche inavvicinabile?» (p. 61). L’operazione di disvelamento non dovrebbe curarsi neppure di simbolismi venerabili, gloriosi: «durante il viaggio alla volta di Porodin attraversammo finalmente il molto, il fin troppo cantato fiume Morava, certo costretto in un ruolo di simbolo e forzato in un alveo emblematico anche a causa dei turchi e delle guerre balcaniche, adesso però semplicemente e autunnalmente povero d’acqua, i sassi affioranti; accanto al ponte stradale, la vecchia carrareccia per carri e pedoni, semisprofondata» (p. 43). La rivelazione si fa però a sua volta “emblematica”, una realtà denudata da segni intenzionali o antichi e quasi naturali; e tuttavia carica di segni ugualmente eloquenti: povertà della Serbia, ma prima ancora nudità, semplicità – quindi verità. L’operazione è delicata, perché comporta la manipolazione di quegli stessi simboli, di quelle immagini significative che la propaganda usa; ma che sono anche gli strumenti dello scrittore – e il linguaggio umano. L’intento che anima lo svelamento non è “collezionistico”, né risente del fascino esercitato da una realtà pura, intatta, non raggiunta dai nostri sfaceli. L’intento è al contrario umanistico: la ricomposizione di un tessuto comune a partire dall’alfabeto delle percezioni e dei sentimenti. Ecco come Handke descrive l’operazione che compie: «proprio seguendo il tortuoso percorso della registrazione di determinate cose secondarie, comunque molto più efficace che attraverso il martellamento dei fatti principali, si risveglia quel ricordare collettivo, quella seconda infanzia comune. “In un punto del ponte c’è stata per anni un’asse traballante”. – “Sì, te ne sei accorto anche tu?” “In un punto sotto il matroneo si sentiva l’eco dei passi”. – “Sì, te ne sei accorto anche tu?” Oppure semplicemente deviare dalla prigionia, di noi tutti, nelle chiacchiere della storia e dell’attualità verso un presente incomparabilmente più fecondo: “Guarda, adesso nevica. Guarda, lì giocano dei bambini” (l’arte della deviazione; l’arte come la deviazione essenziale). E così là sulla Drina sentii la necessità di far danzare un sasso sull’acqua, lanciandolo verso la sponda bosniaca (solo che poi non ne trovai neanche uno)» (pp. 82-83). (Forse il fallimento è garanzia della buona intenzione, dell’essersi mossi sul retto cammino, di non aver piegato la realtà allo scopo? La prosa di Handke, articolata e sfuggente, con il suo centro che si sposta sempre là dove non ci si aspetta, traduce, mi pare, il desiderio di sfuggire ai paragrafi serrati e “naturali” dei sermoni e delle orazioni giornalistiche che hanno ridotto i serbi – un intero popolo! – a una collezione di cliché; ma è anche, temo, inefficace, inascoltabile nella concitazione, quando è necessario decidere – quando i cliché e i pregiudizi rendono tutto più facile.) Il discorso dell’autore si spinge anche sul piano ideologico: la scelta secessionista, la divisione diventano frammentazione, indebolimento, delimitazione apparente di un orticello in cui ad altri sarà facile penetrare. La questione non è soltanto culturale (identità contro multiculturalismo ecc.), ma anche economica: «sentii la cassetta del suo transistor, una musica orientale, quasi già araba, a volume piuttosto basso, come quella che una volta qui aveva risuonato insieme a mille altre melodie e nel frattempo era stata per così dire bandita dallo spazio aereo; […] e sebbene grazie al suono i dintorni sembrassero adesso aprirsi ed estendersi di nuovo, fino al meridione più estremo, già subito greco, questo senso di continente (vigoroso in contrasto con quello “di oceano”) svanì quasi subito, e nell’aria vibrò soltanto un dolore da arto mancante, violento, per certo non semplicemente personale» (p. 69): è la chiusura dei grandi orizzonti, dei grandi progetti – il confezionamento di piccoli Stati folklorici, che potranno vendersi bene. Ecco che alla televisione di Stato si ammira il «presidente sloveno, un tempo un funzionario capace e orgoglioso?, che però adesso offre il suo paese agli stranieri con l’atteggiamento di un cameriere, quasi di un lacchè, come se volesse adeguarsi alla lettera a quella dichiarazione di un imprenditore e committente tedesco secondo la quale gli sloveni non sarebbero questo o quest’altro, bensì “una diligente e laboriosa popolazione alpina”» (p. 67). La riemersione del particolare che va perso nelle generalizzazioni, nello sguardo rapace che vuole cogliere il senso in vista dell’azione, suggerisce anche una vita più vera, un’esistenza che è stata costretta a farsi ascetica e divenuta in tal modo più profonda, densa, piena: «[della Serbia] mi è rimasta l’immagine di una realtà quotidiana, se paragonata alla nostra, più acuita e quasi già cristallina. A causa dello stato di guerra? No, piuttosto a causa di un intero, grande popolo che sa di essere pubblicamente messo al bando in tutta Europa e lo vive come qualcosa di assurdamente ingiusto, e adesso vuole mostrare al mondo, anche se questo non ne vuol prendere atto in alcun modo, che la realtà è abbastanza diversa, non solo sulle strade, ma anche in disparte» (p. 70). In conclusione, è intenso e acuto il rimpianto che Handke esprime – ma al tempo stesso un augurio rivolto ai suoi lettori: «e di fronte alla Drina pensavo, e penso ora anche qui alla scrivania: con le guerre in Iugoslavia la mia generazione non ha perso l’opportunità di diventare adulta? Adulta non come i membri così numerosi, pieni di sé, bell’e pronti, incasellati, dalle opinioni malleabili, in qualche modo internazionali e insieme talmente gretti della generazione dei padri e degli zii, ma adulta, come? Più o meno così: decisa eppure aperta, o permeabile, o per dirla con Goethe: “duttile”, e per motto forse i versi dello stesso maestro tedesco-universale “Come un Bambino/Invincibile”, con la variante Come un bambino/Vincibile. E con questo modo di essere adulti, pensavo io, figlio di un tedesco, uscire dalla storia di questo secolo, da questa catena di sventure, uscire verso un’altra storia» (p. 81).La riflessione di Handke prosegue nell’ Appendice estiva a un viaggio d’inverno."
3324,Un puente sobre el Drina,Ivo Andrić,4.32,9952,671,Chrissie,5,"Finished. About a bridge, a beautiful bridge. Through this bridge one finds hope. But the book is also about the passage of time and the folly of man and the peoples and cultures of the Balkans. One percieves the smallness of man. There are no clear answers. Is it foolish to hope for a better future, and what is better? How does one judge progress? If there is kindness isn't life good? People are weak and mean and foolish, but at the same time they are kind and good and hard working. Both are true, and both will probably always be true. I believe the book says this.Through page 199; One minute I am thinking I cannot go on reading because the cruelty of one human to another is just more than I can take. The writing moves me so, but then the lines change and the author makes me see the beauty of life. I am totally stunned. The writing flips me from one emotion to its opposite. The words in this books do this to me. This author can write, and he can see how people are - how terrible and how wonderful.Through pPage 81: Still marvelous. Beautiful writing. Legends and myths and history all intertwined. The bridge is built (1571-1577) and it certainly wasn't easy. These troubles became the basis of fabulous legends. Then in the latter half of the 1700s their was a flood more terrible than any ever before. The waters rose a good thirty feet and the bridge was submerged, only to become visible again as the river's level lowered. The damage and devastation wrought by the flood was horrible, but of course time rolled on, life in the village continued:""So, in the kapia(the terrace at the center of the bridge), between the skies, the river and the hills, generation after generation learnt not to mourn overmuch what the troubled waters had borne away. They entered there into the unconscious philosophy of the town; that life was an incomprehensible marvel, since it was incessantly wasted and spent, yet none the less it lasted and endured 'like the bridge on the Drina'.""I recommend looking at this bridge when you read the book. It is easy to find pictures on the web of this beautiful eleven-arched stone bridge. How what happened became myth is fascinating. The Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian and Turkish cultures and their respective religious constraints are described through the history fo this bridge, the bridge over the Drina at Visegrad in Bosnia. Page 52 read: This author can write. A Nobel prize winner that can really write, that not only has a message but can truly write. Dam this is GOOD. He makes you see beauty and he makes you see horror. There is no skimming here; you want to catch every nuance. My heart is beating and I don't know what to do with myself. I have to stop before I can go on."
8808,The Adventures of Jimmy Skunk,Thornton W. Burgess,4.12,268,20,Jonathan Marshall,3,"The Burgess Books This is a phrase that brings a smile to my face as often as I hear it. As a young child, I would lose myself for hours in the simple world of the wood and pond inhabited by Little Joe Otter, Buster Bear, Grandfather Frog, and terrorized by Farmer Brown's Boy. I can remember the very shelf, even the exact spot in the little library in Felton, CA where these books were kept. I would return practically every week with a new armload to last me until our next trip to the library. Often I would carry out stories that I read several times before, just so I could once again escape into this imaginary world of furry mischief. I remember these books well in concept, though the specifics of most of the stories elude me. It was easily fifteen years ago when I began reading them and has been over a decade since I last picked up one of Burguess' stories to read it. That being said, this review is being written as a look back. These stories are very simple and very fun. Of course, they are children's literature, so that's to be expected, but these stories strike me as especially so. Even still, I can remember some fascinating things I gleaned between the their covers. For one thing, Burgess did a fantastic job of presenting the ideas of persepective and motivation in simplistic terms. For example, ""The Adventures of Danny Field Mouse"" would cast Old Man Coyote as a vicious, mean creature wishing to prey on Danny and his friends and family. Yet, pick up instead ""The Adventures of Old Man Coyote"" and you'll see that when the story is told with him as the protagonist, those pesky field mice are annoying and useful for little more than a snack. After reading both books, you're no more inclined to think of Old Man Coyote as a villian than you are to think of Danny Field Mouse as a pest that should be exterminated. (Note: This is a generic example. I do not recall if Old Man Coyote plays a role in Danny Field Mouse's story or the other way around, but this concept was presented several times. It made an impression on me.) The only characters consistantly presented as antagonists were Farmer Brown and his boy. This would be one of the only things that I chalk up as odd, or maybe just a little ""off"" in these books. Humans and their influence on nature are presented as a negative influence on nature and animals - always. It's interesting to note though that while humans are seen as a negative, humanity is lauded and held up as virtuous. All of the animals take on not only human personalities but characteristics, traits, and mannerisms. From a frog with a monocle and an otter with a handkerchief tied to a stick, to a busy-body Jay and a reclusive owl who desires only to be left alone, humanity and it's traits keep cropping up. Which would be another thing of value I feel that I saw in the Burgess books. These stories are full of social interaction and personality conflicts, even if they are charicatured more often than not. We see over and over again a working out of peace, if not harmony, between conflicting personalities. It may not always be easy to point out a scripture to reinforce the lesson implied, but social harmony is presented and more often than not, resolution is through reconciliation, forgiveness, or a similar method that is not only laudable, but distinctly Christian in action if not motivation. All in all, the world created by Thornton W. Burgess is imaginative, innocent, fun, and educational. My reccomendation? Grab a handful from your local library, gather a group of kids as an excuse, and lose yourselves in childhood imaginations as you read aloud the stories that have captivated several generations of young readers with the antics of our furry, albiet elusively human, friends. (Disclaimers: As I said, it has been over a decade since I actually read one of Burgess' books. As such, there may be a specific example that's a little off in this review or something that I would have noticed as an adult that my childhood memories are missing. Also, all of these books say I read them in 1998. While I'm certain I read several of them that year, I'm sure I read some before and after that date as well.)"
8809,The Wanting Seed,Anthony Burgess,3.79,4325,276,Tom Lucas,5,"For the most part I like people, even though many of them suck. I am also convinced that the world grows a bit more stupid every day and that we slowly move away from any kind of social evolution. Sure, there's plenty of technological innovation, and dentistry is a far better experience today, but people don't seem to be improving.We still love screwing each other over, arguing about false issues, and murdering each other. Infrastructures are straining under corruption, graft, and greed. Congress is highly polarized and our ""representatives"" do little beyond hooking their friends up and padding the checking account.The worst part of it all is that stupid people just keep breeding.Anthony Burgess, perhaps best known for A Clockwork Orange (most likely you've seen the Kubrick film) had this book published in the same year (1962), and it fits nicely along other literary dystopic works such as 1984, Brave New World, and Anthem. However, as much as I loved it, it's probably not in the same weight class.The Wanting Seed begins in a world that is vastly overpopulated, and extreme measures have been institutionalized to handle it. People live in tiny box apartments, homosexuality is the social norm (and it's policed), and everyone eats a protein mush as there just aren't enough damn cows in the world to handle the load. As you wrap your head around this world (seems like it would be easier to just castrate people instead of implemented totalitarian fabulousness), Burgess throws a curve ball and suddenly society collapses.Yep, you're just reading along, dum dum dum dum dum, and hey, the world's ending.The citizens of the world respond to their overcrowding and repression by engaging in mass cannibalism, groovy sex parties, and general mayhem. No, this isn't a spoiler alert, it's on the damn back of the book, so no comments please. Then, as you would imagine, things level out a bit.There's this brainy back story to the book, that Burgess is essentially commenting on the cyclical nature of human history (which you'll also find in A Clockwork Orange and I'm sure in his other books as well). In short, people suck, they have always sucked, and they will continue to suck. So, why not read a good book and forget about it for a while?"
4035,The Burden of Proof,Scott Turow,4.05,30121,253,Oklahomadave,3,"Following the simultaneous written and cinematic success of its predecessor, ""Presumed Innocent,"" Scott Turow again returns to Kindle County for another dramatic exploration of the emotional vagaries of lives wrapped in the curious legal subculture of American society. In Turow's ""Burden of Proof,"" we find ourselves three years following the events of ""Presumed Innocent"" as a spectator in the life of Sandy Stern, the attorney who famously defended Rusty Sabich in the murder trial from the prior story.This time, there is no murder, but there is a death; the suicide of Sandy's wife, Clara, mated to a seemingly inexplicable withdrawal from her personal trust fund just days before her death. Her death and the unexplained financial transaction leave Stern with more questions than answers, holding fast only to the too-vivid memory of his having discovered the deceased Clara in their garage. Amid Stern's personal tragedy unfolds the increasing encroachment of the legal issues surrounding one of his more problematic clients, Dixon Hartnell, a man of decidely questionable ethics, owner of a large investment corporation, and married to Silvia, one of Stern's sisters. His employment of Stern's son-in-law John, married to daughter Kate, as a floor trader at the Kindle exchange doesn't make things any simpler.Amid the ever tightening circle of influence that an unfolding scandal around Hartnell reveals is the introspection that Clara's death forces on Stern, one wherein he tries to assess his distance as a husband and father, and how his skill at matters of law institutionalized that distance to the point of distraction, creating flawed relationships, incomplete perspectives of his own family, and, ultimately, a troubling picture of himself. He sees himself idealized too much by his other sister, Marta, and fundamentally alienated from his son, Peter, a successful physician. Turow orchestrates an articulately choreographed dance among Stern's family, his neighbors, and the professional peers into a narrative that deviates from its tightly defined story in only a few places. There is little wasted motion, and correspondingly few wasted characters. From the representatives of the US attorney's office that involve themselves in Hartnell's issues, to the office flunkies that manage his company's trading operations, to the neighbors more involved with Sandy following Clara's death, each is woven with a credible and important role in ""Burden of Proof.""Turow draws his characters with sculptor-like precision and insight, with the cognitive depth of a high-resolution mental camera. As one might contrast his writing style with that of John Grisham's typically brisk pacing, Turow's is methodical, deliberate, and purposeful, articulating the finest detail from the subtlest nuance. If Grisham is the quick pacing of a staccato offering, Turow's is the legato counterpart. Even ancillary characters are richly conceived, even if they are nothing more than secondary to the plot, and the richness strengthens the novel's reality with each page.For all of Turow's literary excellence, however, comes a distasteful tempering. Turow holds nothing back in the narrative in describing (among others) Stern's personal exploits as a newly single man among multiple female encounters. The description, in the abstract, is understandable as character exposition, but the lurid depths to which Turow sinks in his narrative grossly tarnishes the broader epic with details better left to magazines rightly delivered in plain brown wrappers. The vulgarity and crassness with which Turow communicates these wholly unnecessary details belies his obvious skill with and mastery of the written word. Where ""Burden of Proof"" was my first Turow novel, this issue alone serves as a primary reason it may well be my last. While the narrative of ""Burden of Proof"" is efficient, it isn't without flaw. Midway through the text, Stern's younger-days courtship of Clara and his edgy relationship with her father are interwoven in flashback. As the latter third of the novel unfolds, these flashbacks become intrusive and needlessly break the narrative momentum as the story progresses to its conclusion. Moreover, Turow waits almost too long to move the story into a higher gear, as Stern's sexual escapades and neighborly intrusions push ""Proof"" perilously close to the border of soap opera, right down to the details of discussions had over privet-hedge trimming.""Burden of Proof"" is, at times, a masterfully woven story of personal insight, of a man arriving too late to his own midlife crisis, forced to construct for himself a new future and a new reality beset by unfathomable circumstances and a confluence of malevolence from his own family. Exceedingly raw sexual content, too much early lethargy, and a frustrating mixture of backstory told in retrospect amid the advancing narrative darkens and diminishes the mastery. And that's nothing less than a shame."
4034,Life After Death: The Burden of Proof,Deepak Chopra,3.79,1742,146,Stacie,3,"I love this guy! He is so intriguing. I have seen him on TV and always thought what he said made sense. So I bought this book... my first Deepak Chopra book. I feel that he has many important things to say, but uses long confusing sentences when he could have easily gotten away with a simpler one. I found myself rereading sentence after sentence. Its not that the vocabulary was difficult, its just that some of the wording can be a bit convoluted. Here is an example.. picked out of the book... ""If there is only one reality, as the rishis declare, then life is not a struggle between good and evil, but a tangled web where all actions, good and bad, move us closer to reality or deeper into illusion."" I mean really, that was a random example, but I had to read that twice... slowly, to get what he was saying. ""the erosion of faith has not left Paradise untouched."" So does that mean it left Paradise touched? I am not sure. The whole book is like that. But, when you finally 'get' what he is saying, it is truly profound. It just takes awhile. Or maybe its just me. "
1689,The Confessions,Augustine of Hippo,3.89,33972,1590,K.D. Absolutely,3,"I never dreamed that one day I would finished reading a 300-page memoir written by a ancient Catholic saint. See, how many saints who lived during the first millennium have written himself a memoir?I twice tried to read The Holy Bible (once in English and once in Tagalog) from cover to cover but failed. I just got distracted by too many details and hard-to-remember names and ancient places and I could not appreciate what were all those characters are doing. Excuses, excuses. They say that reading The Holy Bible needs the Holy Spirit to come to you so that it will be the spirit who will whisper the words to your ears so that you will understand the word of God. Maybe the spirit is still contemplating whether a sinner like me is worth his time and effort. Until I came to this memoir. Written by a self-confessed sinner who is now considered one of the most important figures in the development of Western Christianity: Saint Augustine (latin word for church father)of Hippo (354-430) It took me more than 4 weeks to finish this book. Not a straight read. It is impossible to do that. The memoir is like a letter of St. Augustine to God and in the letter, he is conversing and confessing. He pours out his thoughts, his doubts, his questions. Some of those are funny (based on what we all know now with the advances in science and technology). He tells Him his weaknesses, what wrongs he has done to others. His sins in thoughts, in words, in actions.Reading it is like uttering a prayer. Read a page or two and you get that feeling that you have achieve your daily quota of prayers. St. Augustine poured his heart out in each page of his memoir. Something that is inspiring for me to ask myself those questions he threw out to God and reflect on those thoughts that he put on the pages.There are so many quotes that I would like to capture here but if I do that, I think I will be quoting half of the book. Most of them are in long and winding sentences but this first paragraph of Book 11 is my favorite: 
  Is it possible, lord, that, since you are in eternity, you are ignorant of what I am saying to you? Or, do you see in time an event at the time it occurs? If not, then why am I recounting such a tale of things to you? Certainly not in order to acquiant you with them through me; but, instead, that through them I may stir up my own love and the love of my readers toward you, so that all may say, ""Great is the lord and greatly to be praised."" I have said this before and will say it again. For love of your love I do it. So also we pray - and yet truth tells us, ""Your father knows want things you need before you ask him."" Consequently, we lay bare our feelings before you, so that, through our confessing to you our plight and your mercies towards us, you may go on to free us altogether, as you have already begun; and so that we may cease to be wretched in ourselves and blessed in you - since you have called us to be poor in spirit, meek, mourners, hungering and athirst for righteousness, merciful and pure in heart.""
Now, I have to give The Holy Bible another try. I could not have finished this whole book and pointed that beautiful part if there was no Holy Spirit upon me. Oh ye of little faith."
1691,On Christian Teaching,Augustine of Hippo,3.99,2405,104,Justin Evans,4,"A fascinating little book for all kinds of people: late antiquity buffs; philosophers; hermeneuts; and of course, Christians. Augie usually manages to find his way to a reasonable middle position: against biblical literalism, also against waiting for a direct experience of God. Book one describes 'things' rather than signs, and we get some of Augie's less up to date opinions: you shouldn't love people for themselves, but for the sake of God, and the same thing goes for one's self. But these are backed by more liberal-friendly ideas. The neighbor who we are to love, for instance, is pretty much everyone. We then move on to 'signs, ambiguities and difficulties of,' which is full of fairly sensible advice for anyone who wants to read anything. There are some things you have to know in order to interpret words: languages, for instance, institutions, general facts, logic, rhetoric. But we shouldn't take too much pleasure in these. It sometimes seems, unfortunately, that Augie really thinks you should only know things that are boring and will help you conform to society. I suspect that this claim needs to be put in some kind of historical context--in a solidly Christian culture, presumably, we would be more free to enjoy ""human-made institutions,"" since, he goes on to say, there is much of value to be found even in pagan literature. Having dealt with the difficulties, we move on to the division between literal and figurative understanding of signs. If sections of scripture are not related to moral behavior or to faith, they should be interpreted figuratively (which, though he doesn't say it, means pretty much all of it should be interpreted figuratively). He goes on to discuss morality at some length, making a nice distinction between the corruption of one's own mind and body (wickedness) and harm to another (wrongdoing). Augie, and almost every religious thinker after him, focuses too much on wickedness, and nowhere near enough on wrongdoing. Interestingly, book three was started in the 390s, but abandoned, and only finished in the 420s; much of the later work is less interesting, though classicists might appreciate his description of Tyconius, who wrote his own system of interpretation. Book four, also late, is a defense of the rhetorical beauty of the bible. Not riveting. Not at all. But on the whole, a fascinating, quickish read."
1693,On Christian Doctrine,Augustine of Hippo,3.99,2405,104,Justin Evans,4,"A fascinating little book for all kinds of people: late antiquity buffs; philosophers; hermeneuts; and of course, Christians. Augie usually manages to find his way to a reasonable middle position: against biblical literalism, also against waiting for a direct experience of God. Book one describes 'things' rather than signs, and we get some of Augie's less up to date opinions: you shouldn't love people for themselves, but for the sake of God, and the same thing goes for one's self. But these are backed by more liberal-friendly ideas. The neighbor who we are to love, for instance, is pretty much everyone. We then move on to 'signs, ambiguities and difficulties of,' which is full of fairly sensible advice for anyone who wants to read anything. There are some things you have to know in order to interpret words: languages, for instance, institutions, general facts, logic, rhetoric. But we shouldn't take too much pleasure in these. It sometimes seems, unfortunately, that Augie really thinks you should only know things that are boring and will help you conform to society. I suspect that this claim needs to be put in some kind of historical context--in a solidly Christian culture, presumably, we would be more free to enjoy ""human-made institutions,"" since, he goes on to say, there is much of value to be found even in pagan literature. Having dealt with the difficulties, we move on to the division between literal and figurative understanding of signs. If sections of scripture are not related to moral behavior or to faith, they should be interpreted figuratively (which, though he doesn't say it, means pretty much all of it should be interpreted figuratively).

1694,The Confessions of Saint Augustine,Augustine of Hippo,3.89,33972,1590,K.D. Absolutely,3,"I never dreamed that one day I would finished reading a 300-page memoir written by a ancient Catholic saint. See, how many saints who lived during the first millennium have written himself a memoir?I twice tried to read The Holy Bible (once in English and once in Tagalog) from cover to cover but failed. I just got distracted by too many details and hard-to-remember names and ancient places and I could not appreciate what were all those characters are doing. Excuses, excuses. They say that reading The Holy Bible needs the Holy Spirit to come to you so that it will be the spirit who will whisper the words to your ears so that you will understand the word of God. Maybe the spirit is still contemplating whether a sinner like me is worth his time and effort. Until I came to this memoir. Written by a self-confessed sinner who is now considered one of the most important figures in the development of Western Christianity: Saint Augustine (latin word for church father)of Hippo (354-430) It took me more than 4 weeks to finish this book. Not a straight read. It is impossible to do that. The memoir is like a letter of St. Augustine to God and in the letter, he is conversing and confessing. He pours out his thoughts, his doubts, his questions. Some of those are funny (based on what we all know now with the advances in science and technology). He tells Him his weaknesses, what wrongs he has done to others. His sins in thoughts, in words, in actions.Reading it is like uttering a prayer. Read a page or two and you get that feeling that you have achieve your daily quota of prayers. St. Augustine poured his heart out in each page of his memoir. Something that is inspiring for me to ask myself those questions he threw out to God and reflect on those thoughts that he put on the pages.There are so many quotes that I would like to capture here but if I do that, I think I will be quoting half of the book. Most of them are in long and winding sentences but this first paragraph of Book 11 is my favorite: 
  Is it possible, lord, that, since you are in eternity, you are ignorant of what I am saying to you? Or, do you see in time an event at the time it occurs? If not, then why am I recounting such a tale of things to you? Certainly not in order to acquiant you with them through me; but, instead, that through them I may stir up my own love and the love of my readers toward you, so that all may say, ""Great is the lord and greatly to be praised."" I have said this before and will say it again. For love of your love I do it. So also we pray - and yet truth tells us, ""Your father knows want things you need before you ask him."" Consequently, we lay bare our feelings before you, so that, through our confessing to you our plight and your mercies towards us, you may go on to free us altogether, as you have already begun; and so that we may cease to be wretched in ourselves and blessed in you - since you have called us to be poor in spirit, meek, mourners, hungering and athirst for righteousness, merciful and pure in heart.""
Now, I have to give The Holy Bible another try. I could not have finished this whole book and pointed that beautiful part if there was no Holy Spirit upon me. Oh ye of little faith."
7375,Lafayette,Harlow Giles Unger,4.35,427,68,Tom,5,"I am seriously considering throwing, ""Lafayette,"" in as the middle name of one of my children. Usually when I read a biography I walk away a little disenchanted about the subject, but in this case I found that there once was someone in the universe who could truly be 'admired. How can one man just kick-ass his whole life? From a political, moral and strategic point of view? At 70 he was still kicking ass. And yeah, I came close to crying at times too. The only minor complaint is that I grew weary of the sappy letters to and from George Washington. I'd also add that the next time someone says, ""The French would be speaking German if it wasn't for the United State,"" I'd reply that, ""We'd have the Queen on our dollar bill if it wasn't for Marquis de Lafayette."""
3964,La Chute d'Hypérion,Dan Simmons,4.18,70225,2338,Kemper,5,"""Nurse, this patient’s chart is very confusing.”“Which patient, Doctor?”“Uh..Mr. Kemper. He’s the one in the vegetative state.”“Oh, that’s a very sad and odd case.”“According to the patient history, he was admitted a few weeks ago with cerebrospinal fluid leaking from his nose and ears, but it seemed like he should recover. But yesterday he was brought in again, barely conscious and then he lapsed into a coma. The really odd thing is that I see no signs of injury or disease.”“That’s right, Doctor. It was a book that did this to Mr. Kemper.”“A book? How is that possible?”“From what we can figure out, the first incident occured after he read Hyperion by a writer named Dan Simmons. I guess it’s one of those sci-fi books and apparently the story is quite elaborate. Anyhow, Mr. Kemper had read Simmons before and knew he likes to put a lot of big ideas in his books. But this time, apparently Simmons broke into his house and managed to directly implant much of the book directly into Mr. Kemper’s brain via some kind of crude funnel device.”“I find that highly unlikely, Nurse.”“Most of us did, Doctor. But Mr. Kemper kept insisting that Simmons had some kind of grudge against him. He even had a note he said Simmons had left that said something like ‘Don’t you ever learn? If you keep reading my books, I’ll end you someday.’”“Assuming that I believed this story, I guess that Kemper’s current state tells us that he didn’t heed the warning?”“Apparently not, Doctor. His wife said she found him having convulsions and leaking brain matter out his nose and ears again. A copy of the sequel, The Fall of Hyperion was on the floor nearby.”“I can’t believe that reading a silly sci-fi book could turn an healthy man into a turnip, Nurse.”“Well, when they brought Kemper in, he was semiconscious and muttering. Someone wrote it down. Let see, he kept repeating words and phrases like: Shrike, Time Tombs, the Core, God, uh…no, two gods actually, farcasters, Ousters, religion, pope, death wand, space battles, interplanetary trees, old Earth, AI, mega sphere, data sphere, The Canterbury Tales, poetry, John Keats, Tree of Thorns, and Lord of Pain.”“Jesus! What does all that mean?”“Someone looked it up on the web and all of that is actually in the book.”“That poor bastard. No wonder his gray matter is fried. No one could absorb all that without permanent damage.”“Yes, I’d think that book should have some kind of warning sticker or something on it.”“One thing I still don’t understand, Nurse. If Kemper knew that this book would probably do this to him, why did he still read it?”“I guess he had told several people that Hyperion was just so good that he had to know how it ended, even if it killed him.”***************************************I think the word ‘epic’ was invented to describe this book.What Simmons began in Hyperion finishes here with a story so sprawling and massive that it defies description. In the far future, humanity has spread to the stars, and maintains a web of worlds via ‘farcasters’. (Think Stargates.) On the planet Hyperion, mysterious tombs have been moving backwards in time and are guarded by the deadly Shrike.Seven people were sent to Hyperion on a ‘pilgrimage’ that was almost certainly a suicide mission, but the Ousters, a segment of humanity evolving differently after centuries spent in deep space, are about to invade. The artificial intelligences of the Core that humanity depends on for predictions of future events and management of the farcaster system can’t tell what’s coming with an unknown like the Shrike and Hyperion in play.Battles rage across space and time and the virtual reality of the data sphere as varying interests with competing agendas maneuver and betray each other as the pilgrims on Hyperion struggle to survive and finally uncover the secrets of the Shrike. But the real reasons behind the war and it’s ultimate goal are bigger and more sinister than anyone involved can imagine.I can’t say enough good things about the story told in these first two Hyperion books. This is sci-fi at it’s best with a massive story crammed with big unique ideas and believable characters you care about. Any one of the pieces could have made a helluva book, but it takes a talent like Simmons to pull all of it together into one coherent story."
8814,A Clockwork Orange: Play with Music,Anthony Burgess,4,31,2,Realini,5,"A Clockwork Orange by Anthony BurgessYou must read this and you can forget about the rest of the text here.This is one of the best works that I have ever read. It is one of my absolute favorites and it did not fail to awe me after a third reading.The language is extraordinary, even if it has crossed my mind that, if I were to hear the same language in a Romanian play I would be outraged. It is a strange situation where the language of the Clockwork Orange makes it such a masterpiece, but then hearing the (translated) language on my street I would have a seizure.The subject, the heroes are repelling, the words- as much as I understand them- are terrifying.Alex, the main character keeps saying “horror show”, but this is in the manner of Donnie Brasco, who explained that mobsters use “Forget about it” all the time, for anything: from forget about it, to excellent, we did, he was good, or she was bad…sometimes the meaning hanging on the tone of voice only.Horror show seems to mean perfect and reflect the sick obsession with “ultra- violence”- another word from the slang sensational vocabulary used in this fantastic book.The main theme seems to be the “ultra-violence” and it is portrayed in the most fabulous language ever used by a “brother”…real or fictional. Here are some of these words:Baboochka, bezoomy, brat, britva, chelloveck, devotchka, droog, grahzny, forella, litso, malchick, millicents and many more.Perhaps you should study the words before you read A Clockwork Orange. Even if I missed the meaning of a phrase here and there, because of these Anglo- Russian terms, I loved this book.We come to hate Alex for he is doing: torturing women and homeless people, fighting his own mates. But the punishment raises other issues. I will avoid details, so that you enjoy reading A Clockwork Orange. Much of the pleasure in reading this masterpiece comes from the excellent depiction and not so much from “the action”.However, what happens raises quite a few questions- how much do you punish a criminal? Are prisons overcrowded? And when they are, do they serve the purpose of rehabilitation or they just torture inmates.There are some documentaries, some of them on BBC Knowledge can be watched these days, that present the situation in jails that look like and are Hell on Earth.Yes, criminals must pay for their crimes, but is it just to torture them?One image from the film A Clockwork Orange is very famous: that of Alex played by Malcolm McDowell, who has his eyes forcibly opened with some obvious instruments of torture.The film directed by Stanley Kubrick is excellent and as such one of the rare feats, when both the book and the film are great.We may feel a little guilty for enjoying a book where “ultra-violence” is as present as in Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. A cynical remark might be:-	Yes, but it is so beautiful-	The language is horrible, but sublime…We can learn from this that violence gets you into prison, that the system is wrong, the payback is so awful that ends up by making Alex vomit when he hears…Beethoven.Apart from Alex, the minister of the “inferior” seems to be a bigger villain at times.This book is wonderful and a must read. After you finish it maybe we talk about it: what did you think, did you also see the Kubrick film…?www.realini.blogspot.ro "
8813,Clockwork Orange,Anthony Burgess,3.98,460483,10109,Martine,5,"A Clockwork Orange is one of those books which everyone has heard of but which few people have actually read –- mostly, I think, because it is preceded by a reputation of shocking ultra-violence. I’m not going to deny here that the book contains violence. It features lengthy descriptions of heinous crimes, and they’re vivid descriptions, full of excitement. (Burgess later wrote in his autobiography: ‘I was sickened by my own excitement at setting it down.’) Yet it does not glorify violence, nor is it a book about violence per se. Rather it’s an exploration of the morality of free will. Of whether it is better to choose to be bad than to be conditioned to be good. Of alienation and how to deal with the excesses to which such alienation may lead. And ultimately, of one man’s decision to say goodbye to all that. (At least in the UK version. The American version, on which Stanley Kubrick’s film adaptation was based, ends on a less optimistic note.) In short, it’s a novella of ideas which just happens to contain a fair bit of violence.It is also quite an artistic and linguistic achievement. Those who have seen the film will know that Alex (the anti-hero) and his droogs (friends) speak a made-up language full of Russian loanwords, Shakespearean and Biblical influences and Cockney rhyming slang. Initially this nadsat language was nearly incomprehensible to me, and my first response to it was bad. I found myself cursing Burgess, telling him that it wasn’t fair to put his readers through something like that. (If I want to read an incomprehensible book, I’ll read Finnegans Wake, thank you very much.) However, Burgess takes great care to introduce his new words in an understandable way, so after a few pages I got the hang of the nadsat lingo, and after a few more pages I actually began to enjoy it, because I’m enough of a linguist to go in for that sort of thing. I found myself loving the Russian loanwords, rejoicing when I recognised a German loanword among them and enjoying the Shakespearean quality of Alex’ dialogues. I finished the book with an urgent wish to learn Russian and read more Shakespeare. I doubt many readers will respond to the book in that way (not everyone shares my enthusiasm for languages and classical stuff), but my point is: you’ll get used to the lingo, and at some point you’ll begin to admire it, because for one thing, Burgess is awfully consistent about it, and for another, it just sounds so damned good. I mean, if you’re going to come up with a new word for ‘crazy’, you might as well choose bezoomny, right? Because it actually sounds mad. Doesn’t it?Anyhow, there’s more to A Clockwork Orange than just philosophical ideas and linguistic pyrotechnics. The writing itself is unexpectedly lyrical, and not just when it deals with violence. Some of the most beautiful passages in the book deal with music. More specifically, classical music, because for all his wicked ways, Alex has a passion for classical music. He particularly adores Beethoven, an adoration I happen to share. I came away from the book thinking I might consent to becoming Alex’ devotchka (woman, wife) simply because he is capable of getting carried away by Beethoven’s Ninth and hates having it spoilt for him. He’s cultured, is Alex, and while his culturedness obviously does not equal civilisation and goodness (a point he himself is quick to make), it does put him a notch above the average hooligan. It’s the apparent dichotomy between Alex’ tastes in art and his taste for violence which makes him such an interesting protagonist and which keeps you following his exploits to their not entirely believable (but good) conclusion.In short, then, A Clockwork Orange is an excellent book –- a bit challenging at first, but gripping and interesting and full of style and ideas. Not many books can claim as much. "

8817,Shakespeare,Anthony Burgess,3.91,278,22,Bookdragon Sean ,4,"So after yesterday’s post it seems only fair to reveal what my hidden quotes were. Everything in bold is a Shakespeare quote. I did say they were hidden. Perhaps even in plain sight! (Don't hate me when you read the first one) (1)“There’s Rosemary. That’s for remembrance.” It’s the 400th anniversary since Shakespeare’s death! I just had to post something Shakespeare related on this day of all days. I mean can you blame me? Shakespeare’s just awesome. Also to liven things up a bit, I’ve discretely layered my review with Shakespeare phrases. Can you spot any? Some are obvious, but I don’t think you’ll find them all. There are thirteen in total.So here goes. This is the most unscholarly scholarly book I’ve ever read. It’s witty, supremely entertaining, and no less informative than a standard biography. It’s also quite concise; there’s no waffle:(2) brevity is the soul of wit. (3)It’s the best of both worlds really. I really enjoyed this, and I learnt a great deal about the Bard in the process. (4)It’s the be-all and the end-all of Shakespeare biographies really. In (5)one fell swoop Burgess provides a great level of detail about Shakespeare’s background; it provides a great level of detail about the man himself and the time in which he wrote. Burgess isn’t bias; he just provides as much information as possible. He starts from the beginning, from Shakespeare’s (6)flaming youth, (7)to his death bed where he breathed his last.The chapters are organised for easy reference. It really is a good little book. In case you didn’t know, Anthony Burgess is the author of the famous  A Clockwork Orange. So there’s going to be some skill in the writing. I tend to find biographies dry and boring; however, this was almost uplifting in places. (8)And that’s the naked truth.My edition is the beautiful folio society one. The only way I could justify buying more of these lovely, and expensive, books was if they were university related, so I was very pleased to find this. Even if I’m no longer studying Shakespeare! (9)There's the rub.But who cares? Despite finishing with this a university, I think I will always be studying Shakespeare. Shakespeare’s verses are  (10) as swift as a shadow, and his plays are  (11)such stuff as dreams are made on. His writing, his legacy, is everlasting. (12)In my heart of heartsI can tell you that there will never be a day when Shakespeare’s words aren’t relevant to the world. All people have to do is open their ears and hear them. (13)That’s the short and the long of it.How many did you spot? "

2255,Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives,Dan Millman,4.13,37134,1592,Michael Cunningham,5,"I haven't been reading or writing much lately, but I did just finish Way of the Peaceful Warrior, a book that was given to me long ago by a friend of my brother. The friend was addicted to heroin at the time and had just pawned off my acoustic guitar I lent him in order to buy more junk. He came to me shortly after the event and told me he had something for me while reaching into his backpack. I knew my guitar wouldn't fit in the bag... and I wasn't using heroin.. so I had zero idea what the hell he was about to give me. Out of his bag he pulled out a beat up copy of `Way of the Peaceful Warrior', handed it to me with a smile, and said `I never give my books to anyone, but I want you to have this'. I glanced at the front cover, which boldly claimed it was a `Book That Changes Lives', and automatically thought `heard that one before', said thanks, and put it in my bag. In retrospect I noticed he was a lot calmer than usual, but I didn't make any connection between that and the book he gave me. At the time I was so absorbed in my own little world that I had minimal awareness of other people and my environment.I read a couple of pages a day or two later, and deciding I wasn't interested in the story, put it back in the bookshelf where it collected dust for a while. That was maybe a year ago, I can't recall, but quite recently I saw the friend again, after a long absence, and found out that he was leaving Melbourne for good to move to Hawaii. So I decided I would read that book he gave me; after all, he had previously introduced me to The Alchemist, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance and Shantaram, so I figured he was a on a roll with good books. I read the book in Bali in a couple of days, and I didn't want it to end. After I finished it I felt a zest that I hadn't felt in a long time; I bubbled with energy and appreciation for life. Has this book changed my life? Definitely. Infinite gratitude goes to the friend who gave me the book, whose life appears to have changed as well: he has now kicked his heroin addiction, is practicing a vegan diet, and is getting married to a beautiful girl in Hawaii!It's a good thing I didn't read the book when I first received it, because I don't think I was at a stage in my life where I could appreciate such a book, or absorb its insights. This is the sort of book that will come to you when you are ready, and I don't doubt that you will read it more than once when that time comes. As for the story, it's not important, but I'll humour you and say it's about a young gymnast named Dan Millman (the book's author: it's a partly autobiographical book) who discovers an old nameless man at a gas station, whom he develops a teacher/student relationship with. Dan calls the old man Socrates, which is a very fitting name for two reasons: 1. Socrates, the Greek philosopher, was very wise. And 2. No one knows whether Socrates really existed, as he only exists within the writings of Plato, his pupil. Socrates is for the most part shrouded in mystery, but what does get revealed to you about him I will not ruin. This is a book that I think is best to know as little about as possible before reading. All I will say is that the book follows the relationship of Dan and Soc till the very end as Dan, and the reader, struggle to come to terms with the new world Socrates has opened up - a world of infinite energy and potential."
2251,The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People,Stephen R. Covey,4.05,344970,6303,Stephen,1,"    I would like to make clear that David Hasselhoff's appearance in this review should in no way be deemed to imply that I endorse or support his career in any way whatsoever.Thank you for your understanding.
 FIVE ""PRACTICAL"" HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLEFirst, a few comments on the seven so-called “habits” identified in the book, namely:1.Be proactive, 2.Begin with the End in Mind, 3. Put First Things First, 4. Think Win-Win, 5. Seek First to Understand, then to be understood, 6. Synergize, and7. Sharpen the SawIn a word…..crap!! In several words, what a giant, steaming pile of new-age, masturbatory, corp-lingo, platitude spewing bullshit. Think Win-Win…are you kidding me with this Jim Jones Kool-aid party chant? Synergize….just hearing that word makes me throw up in my mouth.Sharpen the saw….exactly…reading that phrase makes me literally want to sharpen the saw and slice a hate filled path through the contents of this book. This book is like a giant fortune cookie full of sounds good but says nothing. My advice: rather than read this book, go get a six pack or a bottle of wine, grab some China Mieville or Dan Simmons and find a nice comfy tree to sit under while you read something that might actually expand your mind. Now I certainly don't have any foolproof answers or magic exercises that will help you bring out the ""inner-winner"" inside you. However, I did come up five pracical (and hopefully a little humorous) habits that have proven to be pretty effective at making people successful in their chosen field (tongue planted firmly in cheek). 1.  EMBRACE TECHNOLOGY AND MEDICAL SCIENCE TO BECOME THE BEST YOU CAN BE
  2. BE BOLD, BE DARING AND DELIVER TO THE MARKETPLACE THE NEXT BIG THING 
  3. DON’T BE AFRAID TO USE THE FORCE TO ACCOMPLISH YOUR GOAL

2071,Freedom Evolves,Daniel C. Dennett,3.81,2157,100,Samir Rawas Sarayji,1,"100 pages into this book and I became utterly bored. I find it hard to digest holistic overview approaches when used by a philosopher to prove his point. Let me say at the outset that I never studied philosophy (although I did study mathematical logic) and I haven't read much in the field either, and that my criticism is that of a writer and an enthusiastic reader who's always curious. The few classic philosophy texts that I've read in the past held me from start to finish, like a good novel does, and cajoled me into understanding where the philosopher is coming from and what it is he's trying to achieve. What I like about that is that the philosophy is argued within the realm of philosophy - logical thought arguments. More modern approaches seem to be overly scientific in that they actually need to site latest developments or discoveries from the hard sciences such as physics or neurobiology to...well, to sort of validate themselves. Like arguing for the sake of arguing within the parameters of the available knowledge in their field is.. pointless. I don't know if this is true, or a general shift in the field of modern philosophy, but reading it in these bestseller-type books is exceptionally boring to me. Besides, the eastern civilizations have, for centuries, approached the 'big questions' holistically - and they've done a brilliant job at explaining the universe without the scientific method or modern technology. So if philosophers and scientists have an itch in their pants to need to tackle these grand cosmic questions using their western tools, at least write about it bearing in mind that I'm a pea brain who likes digestible chunks of information without repetition, over explanation, mathematics, references... I mean, seriously, either stick to your academic papers or take a damn writing workshop if you insist on tormenting me with your rhetoric, you just might publish something worth reading outside academia."
2070,Sweet Dreams: Philosophical Obstacles to a Science of Consciousness,Daniel C. Dennett,3.74,337,26,Greg,3,"Something has been bugging me more and more about Dennett recently. The more I read about consciousness, whether it be from the perspective of neuroscience, philosophy, or psychology, the more I think there is a real question that needs to be answered about qualia. Qualia, the character of subjective experience. The redness of red. The smell of a rose. The feeling of anger or love, and the experience of pain. Chalmers dubbed this the ""hard problem of consciousness"", referring to the problem of explaining why we have qualitative phenomenal experiences. And many brilliant philosophers have expended much energy trying to explain (or explain away) these qualia states in terms of the underlying nuerological processes. Some saying that eventually neuroscience can provide a complete explanation, and on the other extreme, those espousing dualistic theories that state quaila are a real *thing*, separate from physical matter, and most likely not in the purview of science. Dennett thinks there is no conversation to be had. Qualia do not exist. He spends a lot of time criticizing different views of qualia, stating that the fact that there is no clear consensus in regards to what philosophers mean by qualia is a huge problem for the debate (rightly so). He provides thought experiment after thought experiment that showcase the many errors in logic that go into our normal conception of what qualia is. These are all valid criticisms, but criticizing the logic behind various conceptions of qualia does not change the fact that I have subjective experience, and right now neither philosophy nor neuroscience can explain how this subjective experience is substantiated by neuronal firing. This is an important question, one which we may never have an answer to for all I know. But denying that there is a question in the first place doesn't make any sense to me. One example that Dennett uses is an experiment where a series of alternating pictures are presented to subjects. The pictures are identical accept for one small part which is changed in color. Subjects are asked to push a button when they become aware of the difference in pictures (which takes people a long time). He then asks if before you were aware of the difference, if your color qualia was changing (as the image that falls on your retina, and sent to your visual cortex is obviously changing). He then proceeds to outline all sorts of problems with whatever answer you give. That’s all fine and good, but it doesn’t change the fact that I experienced *something* and Dennett cannot explain how that experience is substantiated in an organism.I'm as strong a materialist as Dennett is (I guess until Chalmers convinces me otherwise), so to me, I have an even more vested interest in thinking that there needs to be an explanation for how and why qualia exists. Explaining how our neurophysiology substantiates experience, meaning, and a unified conscious experience is to me the holy grain of consciousness research. Whether we will ever get there is up for debate, but pretending the problem doesn’t exist doesn’t make sense to me. Am I missing something? Does Dennett know something I don’t (well, almost certainly he knows a WHOLE BUNCH that I don’t, but I really think he’s wrong to dismiss the importance of qualia)?Maybe he’ll actually address this as the book goes on (I’m only 2/3rds in). But from what I remember of consciousness explained, it doesn’t seem like he feels any need to. Dennett is great about pointing out logical fallacies in regards to all sorts of theories of consciousness, but seems to be quite content to leave all sorts of vague holes in his theories. Is it because he doesn’t know how to fill in those holes, or doesn’t know that those holes exist?-----------------------------Finished, review to come shortly..."
2073,The Intentional Stance,Daniel C. Dennett,3.99,239,15,Joshua Stein,4,"It has been a while since I have read Dennett, and rereading the Intentional Stance in the context of philosophy of science (one of the areas I'm working more on lately) was incredibly thought provoking. In the course of the discussion, Dennett unpacks a pragmatic strategy for talking about different sorts of systems and individuals; the defense is incredibly striking as a lot of philosophers are work more and more as discussing science as a pragmatic enterprise, and Dennett seems clearly to have been ahead of the ball on this.His defense of folk psychology as a successful approach to understanding behavior, one that is sufficiently strong to undercut the behaviorists that he is responding to implicitly, is somewhat tenuous in places; this shouldn't be surprising because the defense was pretty new. Many of the angles in the defense are expanded much more in his later work, and the work of many of his peers. There are still good reasons to be skeptical of his defense of folk psychology, of ""the intentional strategy"" or the eponymous stance, but Dennett is willing to give up a lot of ground in acknowledging that what he is advocating is a strategy that has a number of deep points of value.When I first read the book, it was in dialectic with the much more deflationary realism of Paul Churchland. (Whose two books that had the relevant ideas I have reviewed here and here.) In retrospect, this dialectic is not totally right. While he does interact with Churchland actively in a few passages, it is largely to agree with Churchland's point that strictly speaking folk psychology and intentional state ascription is likely false, but (contra Churchland) that it still plays an important role in both our ordinary and scientific lives. In a sense, he and Churchland are in agreement that the behaviorism of the previous generation is totally explanatorily inadequate, and differ somewhat in what has to happen next in order to build a better set of neurological and psychological sciences. For Dennett, that includes the intentional stance.Many of the most important passages of Dennett, his discussion of the intentional states of thermostats, for example, are really valuable to read in context; it only occurs to me after rereading this book how deep and rich Dennett's cases are, and how often they are really read and used superficially, even in otherwise good critiques of Dennett. I strongly, strongly recommend the book to people who are interested in what happened to behaviorism, and why philosophers and scientists shoved off from it in favor of different and richer approaches, including the intentional stance."
2068,Darwin's Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life,Daniel C. Dennett,4.03,11435,226,Greg,5,"1. Roughly 47% of Americans believe the theories in this book to be complete and utter bullshit at best, and at worst the work of the devil. That same 47 percent of the population that doesn’t believe in evolution also do not believe in the Sumerians or Dinosaurs. There is nothing that can be said to make them see that they could possibly be wrong about the world being created roughly 6,500 years ago, but that is fine because I believe the world was actually created 10 seconds ago, and it was created all for me, with everyone and everything in it, including all my memories supplied just to give me and my own personal universe a history, which of course it is lacking since it has only existed for about a minute and a half now. Sorry that you don’t exist as much more than a ‘thing’ (and not even really that, most of you are just kind of there as non-entities I will never actually encounter, but even if I do you are still only in my head, so you’re not even things. But if you are a non-thing reading this feel free to click that you like this review) only here as color for my universe. 2. If you don’t believe you’re uneducated about the theory of evolution, this book may not be the best place to start. I think Dennett doesn’t mean for this to be an introduction to the topic, maybe a road map, where he points out some interesting spots along the way, and gives you ample opportunities to read and learn more for yourself in his 35 page bibliography, but if you are half-ignorant, like me, then you are going to be taking a lot of what he says at face value, for the time being at least. Instead of being a primer into the theory, the book is an expansive overview of the controversies and ramifications of the evolution on a wide variety of topics. Unless one is super-duper smart in all different fields, there is probably going to be quite a lot that you’ll end up just nodding along to, accepting Dennett’s reading of a particular issue and his answers to those issues. At times I probably got too accepting and just nodded along with my critical goggles put safely away since I had no idea how to judge the merits of the arguments being presented. 3. Three is a special number. It’s the dialectic, it’s the dad, the kid and the not so friendly ghost, it’s got lots of other meanings that my head knows but which it doesn’t want to give up right now. It’s also the number of thinkers that I’ve always imagined, and I’m guessing most people who care about things like this would agree with, that are considered the Heavy-Weights of revolutionary thinkers that shaped modernity. That would be Darwin, Marx and Freud. Can this be considered pretty un-controversial? Good. Or not, but at least nod along with me and pretend you agree. 4. Lets leave Daniel Dennett here and move across the pond, so to speak, to the universe of Continental philosophy. What Dennett is putting forth in this book is that Darwin’s dangerous idea isn’t just about decentering the universe and man’s place in it. It’s not just about showing that creationism is the intellectual equivalent of believing that the world is flat or that the sun rotates around the Earth. Dennett calls the idea of evolution a universal acid that is so strong it corrodes everything it touches, or maybe not corrodes, but changes at least. Using a different metaphor, and one more apt to Continental philosophy, Darwin’s idea is a hammer that smashes right through most of Western Philosophy. Nietzsche wanted to philosophize with a hammer, well by Dennett’s description Darwin is the tool that can do that. Plato’s theory of ideal forms? Smash. Aristotelian means and his four basic causes? Smash. Cartesian duality? Smash. John Locke? Smash! Why? This might not be totally accurate, but I could argue it and in a manner of thinking it’s true, Darwin removed metaphysics and teleology and was able to give the ground work for a scientifically provable explanation for the world. 	Removing the science part, isn’t this kind of what the most contemporary strands of Continental thought were trying to do? Isn’t saying philosophy is dead, the author has died, God is dead, etc., isn’t deconstructing everything in sight, travesing plateaus, seeing the world as a simulacra, declaring reality to have been left behind (add any other wacky French theory here), aren’t these all ways of saying the entire tradition of Western Philosophy (or thought) is problematic? Funny thing is, I don’t ever remember coming across a Darwinian theorist in those intellectual waters. Which is kind of strange. Here is something that is being worked on with results, facts and figures and numbers and graphs and all of those things scientists come up with that can be used to show an entirely non-phantom description of the universe, the mind, creation, etc., and as far as I’m aware it is never used. Looking at the number people willing to use Lacan as an expert with his idea that the absent is actually more present than what is present and the present is actually not there at all (seriously did this actually help anyone who went to get psychiatric help? I find it to be great fun to think in these lines, but outside of coming up with neat explanations for texts where does this go? What kind of proof can there be? It’s fun sophistry.), or overextending Marx to cover anything under the sun and stick it with a teleology, or to step back one level of influence, the continued predominance of Hegelian thinking, which where it’s true it’s kind of like saying so what, and where it’s wrong it’s embarrassing the degree that it’s wrong by. I’m a little embarrassed that I never thought of the ramifications that Dennett pointed out until now. Not that I ever really studied Darwin at all, or any science for that matter, but just the general ideas that are opened up by his explanation of evolution aren’t a big intellectual leap to see how it ultimately undermines metaphysics, and can remove the boogeymen of the soul and god from the intelligent thoughts about causality. 4. Four is the tetrad. The most perfect number to Pythagoras, 1+2+3+4=10. I’m just throwing that in because I have nothing more. This review I thought would be more coherent. I thought I’d have something productive to say. I thought my thoughts on continental philosophy would be more substantial, but they aren’t. I’ll have to keep working on them and maybe share them in a review where they will be even more out of place. "
2069,Consciousness Explained,Daniel C. Dennett,3.89,6004,242,Elena,4,"A more accurate title here would be “Consciousness Explained Away,” as greater wits than I have pointed out. This re-titling itself gives the gist of the work's true project, which is to see just how far the explaining-away of our first-person starting point as conscious existents can proceed before self-contradiction ensues. A big part of the problem is Dennett's disingenuous attempt to masquerade explaining-away for explanation which makes it difficult to assess the true value of his contribution to the problem. A more minor annoyance was Dennett's penchant for rhetorical pyrotechnic displays, through which he expresses his sustained assurance that, should the reader fail to accept the terms of his reductive mode of explanation, it must simply be because s/he is a rank, blinkered dogmatist given to retrograde mythifying! Yet it turns out that, like a photo negative, even an attempt to explain-away can indirectly illumine the object. When Dennett's angle of approach leads him to self-contradiction, or else to smuggle in ever subtler computational and mechanomorphic anthropomorphisms in order to fill the explanatory gaps that are (inevitably) left over, we can discern the areas in which his eliminative materialist starting point fails us and where we need to pay the phenomenology of lived experience its dues. Introspection reveals a distinction between two ways that a thing can be a locus in the world: perspective and physical location. Whereas the latter can be defined geometrically, as a point held in a web of relations in space and time, the latter, as a qualitative locus, seems to leave us with an unexplained phenomenal remainder when we consider it from a purely physicalist framework. The criteria by which we conceive the identity of our first-person being and those that we use to conceive the identity of physical objects thus seem to diverge at this point, hence the so-called hard-problem of consciousness. Dennett's is an effort to explain in purely third-person terms the most characteristic features of our conscious life, most notably, the persistent conviction we have of being selves, loci of perspective, and unitary ontic centers in our own right. This is the persisting intuition we have of the irreducibility of our first-person stance, which discloses the world as experience. Unfortunately, explanation by third-person principles falls short of describing the integrity and consistency of the phenomenal domain, and Dennett is left throughout trying to (rather awkwardly) explain away all the phenomena that can't fit on the procrustean bed of his eliminativist methodology. In the process, reified computational metaphors are smuggled in to fill the explanatory void left once reference to the phenomena themselves has been suppressed. The central thesis in Dennett's work is that the self, far from being some ultimate ontological reference point, as it has been since at least the Cogito, is an epiphenomenal construct. To understand the significance of this move, you have to consider the foundational function the notion of the substantival self has played in philosophy. Now, we infer a substantial, ontic center to the psyche, much as we once inferred an ontic center to the natural order, via the concept of God. The reasoning in both cases is the same: if there's an orderly web (to borrow Dennett's own image) to be seen, there must be a center to the web, whether that web be experience or the cosmos itself. Losing reference to that center, we lose our last basis for grounding explanation itself in some kind of reality, even the restricted reality of the self, to which Kant clung for rational grounding.The placeholder for the center in an ontology is the sign of signs, because it is the organizer of all other signs. The self is perhaps the last refuge of substance ontology in the post-Kantian worldview. Phenomenology has since replaced ontology as rational grounding, and as substance was evacuated from the cosmos, it was pushed inwards, into the domain of “lived experience.” Now we find the last remainder of substance ontology in the notion of the supposed irreduibility of the “qualia” characterizing the first person stance. Kant posited the empirically unknowable central subject as a necessary presupposition for explaining the order and regularity that emerge in our otherwise scattered stream of experience. The Kantian transcendental argument for postulating a unitary subject that underlies and grounds the systematicity of experience can be summed up as follows: “If there is no central self, then there can be no regularity in experience. If there is no regularity in experience, then no explanation is possible, scientific or otherwise. But scientific explanation is, manifestly, possible. So there must be a unitary self grounding the experience from which scientific explanations are gleaned.” Dennett's radical claim, against Kant, is that we can have regularity, and therefore explanation, without postulating a substantial, central self stocked with qualia. Such a postulate, to him, is merely a reified abstraction from underlying, neural-computational processes. Dennett clearly takes an impish delight in his self-promotion as myth-buster extraordinaire. He takes great pains to show how the higher order unities of aesthetic enjoyment, responsible ethical agency and rational understanding that structure our experience at its highest are nothing more than the by-products of the collective behaviour of “stupid machines” in the brain. According to his multiple-drafts theory of consciousness, the sense of our being grounded in a unitary center of subjectivity at any given time – that feeling that underlies all experience, that we can give words to and call “I here, now” - is a mere abstraction edited out of a confluence of “parallel, multitrack processes of interpretation and elaboration” that are inaccessible to introspection. The “I” that seems attached to every datum of my experience, making it “mine,” turns out to be a linguistically reified narrative construct. It represents the draft that momentarily trumps all others, the one that best streamlines the cacophony of parallel inner processes of endless revision into some kind of provisionally coordinated, working whole. There is no “central meaner” that corresponds to the linguistic sign, “I,” nor anything remotely akin to a causal agent in the brain. Unitary, centralized consciousness is a pragmatic “user illusion.” “Consciousness Imagined,” indeed. If anybody thought that the last vestige of Substance ontology that we find in the Kantian Transcendental Subject could hide here, in the fictive “Cartesian Theater” of phenomenology, Dennett would disabuse us of this notion.In his chapter, “The Reality of Selves,” he describes the self as a narrative and pragmatic “principle of organization.” It is not much of a stretch to say that, according to his theory, we story ourselves into existence, much as we are storied by others. “Our fundamental tactic of self-protection, self-control, and self-definition is not spinning webs or building dams, but telling stories, and more particularly connecting and controlling the story we tell others - and ourselves - about who we are.”He describes how making a self has to do with boundary creation, first via biological, then via cultural means. Boundary production starts with fencing off one's turf in physical space, as a cell forms a semi-permeable lipid membrane around itself. It culminates with fencing off one's turf in symbolic-linguistic space via the narrative identity-kits with which we shape our experience into a whole that bears the mark of our historic, cultural, and social backgrounds. Our narratives are thus our most powerful tools, as a species. The way that a spider spins webs to gain power over its environment in shaping it, so do humans gain control by reshaping their cultural environment via their posited narratives. Remember, consciousness to Dennett -just is- the epiphenomenal glow that attends a powerful, winning narrative structure. Persistent identity is persistent narrative. The boundaries of consciousness are the boundaries supplied by given patterns of narrative formation. Enter Foucault's analysis of the relation between narrative patterns and entrenched power structures. “And where is the thing your self-representation is about? It is wherever you are. And what is this thing? It is nothing more than, and nothing less than, your center of narrative gravity.” Far from being a necessary ontological postulate of reason, a “thing” or a “place” where you find your standing in the world, consciousness turns out to be a fiction that is successively neurally re-instantiated according to variable cultural patterns of stimulus-selection. The only “center” that we in fact have is an imaginative construct, a “center of narrative gravity.” There is no agency, no you, involved in this ceaseless editorial process. “You” are quite simply storied into being by your brain's underlying computational processes. The core schema of “you” emerges as a means of simplifying the discordant mess of neural processes so as to produce a coherent map of reality that your brain can use to orient itself in the world.So how do you get rational integration and unified conscious experience out of the collective behaviour of irreducibly plural interpretive strands of neuro-computation? To explain that, Dennett introduces the metaphorical device of a piece of neural “software” that, much like a serial computer, creates a step-by-step narrative thread out of the multiplex cacophony of conflicting reality-takes. Whether and how reason can mysteriously emerge from such a clamour of “stupid” computational “processes” is unclear. The metaphor does all the argumentative work here by painting a picture, and assures us that somehow, it just all hangs together like-so. Mental imagery is where we'd be most tempted to posit some kind of substance to experience, in the form of qualia. It is precisely this domain that he surveys at some length, although from what I've read elsewhere (Evan Thompson's Mind in Life has a great chapter surveying the current state of imagery research), the imagery research so critical to his philosophical argument is far from being conclusive. Mental images, he argues, are what most supply us with the illusion that there is what he calls “figment” or “plenitude” to experience. Above all, it is images that give the feeling of continuity. But it's computation all the way down, if you look at experience (of colour, for instance) from a neural processing perspective. Because he characterizes experience as a “theoretical, narrative construct,” there is no “hard problem of consciousness” for him to contend with. The problem, he hopes, vanishes through redescription via the reigning computational metaphor.And what about our nagging sense that experience comes as a sort of system, a perceptibly integrated whole, in short? “What we actually experience is the product of many processes of interpretation – editorial processes in effect.” In Dennett's view, it is this ongoing selectivity, simplification and editing out of surplus information so that it comes to fit a manageable pattern that can guide the organism's responses at the time. Moreover, “paradoxically, our sense of continuity comes from our marvelous insensitivity to most kinds of changes rather than from any genuine perceptiveness.” The “unity” that we take to be the measure of conscious realization is thus, ironically, a measure of blindness. This abstractive process of simplification that gives the semblance of consistency, integrity and texture to our stream of consciousness exists because of its great adaptive value, helping reduce noise in favour of survival-relevant information. Underlying the official editorial revision that glosses unity, our experience is, in fact, a cacophonous din. Nor is there any canonical version of experience that you could poke a stick at and claim to be the real, true, “authentic” version of your experience. There is only an endless proliferation of versions, of drafts, of angles and perspectival takes. This is not only too bad for the poor self striving for autonomy, but also for the whole endeavour of philosophy and science to produce a complete explanation of anything. A Kantian quest for monolithic, universal principles of perspective-taking (which could provide the basis for explanation) was a neurally unrealizable fantasy. There just is no rationally unified perspective in the brain.Since the interpretive pattern that constitutes “consciousness” is configured according to parameters learnt via cultural indoctrination, “pure” phenomenology turns out to be an exercise in cultural description. Far from offering any privileged access to my mind, it turns out to offer no access at all, since all that swims up to the top from this preconscious swarm is cultural script. Dennett's ontological commitment to a mechanistic-computational metaphor ultimately compels him to devalue first person evidence by claiming its reducibility to a “heterophenomenological” approach that a priori assumes that verbal reports give us sufficient purchase on lived experience. Every dimension of experience that doesn't fit into the constraints of his methodological presuppositions falls through the cracks as so much fictive dross. That experience is to a large extent a formal construct is an insight at least as old as Kant. However, what Kant and most of his successors had and what Dennett wants to do away with is the residual ontic substrate that was held to necessarily underlie the construct. Dennet would slice away even this and in its place substitute a free-floating tissue of narrative monologue, supported only by distributed parallel processing. Dennett's overriding motive is, I think, at bottom noble. He is troubled by the proliferation, in past attempts to explain mind, of homuncular, anthropomorphic, perpetually-unopenable, and intuitively-pleasing black-boxes which are supposed to designate the terminus of explanation. Where scientific analysis fails, a suitable homuncular resting point – a pseudo-explanatory myth or fiction – can be inserted. However, his solution to the problem substitutes one mode of pseudo-explanation for another. Terrence Deacon, in his “Incomplete Nature,” called the eliminativist pattern of pseudo-explanation a species of explanation by “golems.” “Golem” accounts are attempts to describe the phenomenon of mind by dissecting it into mechanistic/computational parts. Dennett's view of mind as an information-processing device constituted by the joint functioning of myriad mini “stupid machines” in the brain is clearly a golem. Deacon shows how attempts such as Dennett's to purge anthropomorphic black-boxes, or homunculi, out of scientific explanation only end up being forced to pay their dues to the qualitative loci for which homunculi are “place-holders” by bringing ever-more “cryptic homunculi” into the picture, usually in the form of “golems,” which are “fractionated homunculi.” Deacon offered an elegant argument showing that explanation by golems is a cure worse than the homunculus disease, because it proceeds by presupposing ever subtler homuncular properties (such as informational, representational, and functional properties) at lower levels, without explaining them. Thus, the impersonal computational machines projected into the brain are treated by Dennett as ultimate loci of representation and information, without explaining how these representational and informational relations emerge. Deacon showed how such a view takes informational relations out of the larger dynamic context which makes them possible and which grounds their real-world reference. It relies on an abstract, engineering definition of information which presupposes extrinsically-imposed reference – a human interpreter who can fix the representational relationship, or specify what the information is about. In contrast, he shows how information in living organisms is intrinsically interpreted, by virtue of the role it plays in the self-organizing dynamics of life. Thus, Dennett's reductionist approach cannot explain end-directed phenomena such as information, and representation, even as it presupposes these by inserting them, as “cryptic computational homunculi,”to make its eliminativist explanation work. I would agree with Deacon that Dennett's hand-waving pseudo-explanatory insertions, at crucial parts of his argument, of golem metaphors can't be seen, as Dennett claims, as just descriptive glosses to be replaced by the more complex neuro-computational explanation that is supposed to be forthcoming. Rather, they must be seen as the places at which efforts to explain away phenomenology break down.Lastly, the Kantian challenge of grounding explanation without the postulate of a unitary self remains. What is the epistemic status of Dennett's theory, if correct? If correct, and multiple drafts are all there are, then Dennett undercuts his own theory's rational basis. The whole truth of the theory is predicated on Dennett's (and our) capacity to hold together a synoptic, rational perspective on our minds that is more than just a momentary coalescence of distributive parallelism and interpretive pluralism. Otherwise, truth claims – even Dennett's – would be merely pragmatic fictional simplifications which are also inescapably distortions of the facts. An empirical theory that “explains away” the unity of conscious experience as an epiphenomenon undercuts its own rational basis. The theory, as such, can't even be coherently articulated. In articulating it, you refute it, because you presuppose the first-person unitary subject that you attempt to explain away. More troubling still, it doesn't seem to be capable of informing any possible perspective that we can take on the world.An empirical, homunculus-free explanation of consciousness need not be a reductive golem. Such an account is provided by such thinkers as Damasio, Deacon, Thompson, and Lakoff, whose physicalist theories of mind are nonetheless developed in dialogue with first-person accounts of lived experience. Ultimately, as Thompson points out, experience is, inescapably, our original guide, since the content of any of the concepts that frame a theory of mind can only come from our intuitive, first-person experience of our own minds:“To deny the truth of our own experience in the scientific study of ourselves is not only unsatisfactory; it is to render the scientific study of ourselves without a subject matter. But to suppose that science cannot contribute to an understanding of our experience may be to abandon, within the modern context, the task of self-understanding. Experience and scientific understanding are like two legs without which we cannot walk. We can phrase this very same idea in positive terms: it is only by having a sense of common ground between cognitive science and human experience that our understanding of cognition can be more complete and reach a satisfying level. We thus propose a constructive task: to enlarge the horizon of cognitive science to include the broader panorama of human, lived experience in a disciplined, transformative analysis.” This is, IMO, the path that philosophy of mind must take if it is to explain, rather than explain away, consciousness. Ramachandran states the challenge as it confronts us today: ""to reconcile the first person and third person accounts of the universe... (is) the single most important problem in science."" In the mean time, recovering the more comprehensive understanding of empiricism, defined as the clarification of experience, would in itself pave the way to a paradigm much more true to where we stand, and cannot help but stand."
8928,The Hound of the Baskervilles,Arthur Conan Doyle,4.09,181190,5533,Doug Cannon,4,"My Grandpa Cannon loved this story, and he often told of a time when he went to see a ""picture show"" about the Hound of the Baskervilles. ""It scared the willies out of me,"" he said, and then he and his friend had to part ways as my grandpa rode his bicycle home in the dark.He was thinking about this devil-hound, and then he heard something panting behind him. He pedaled faster and faster, but the panting only got faster and faster too. Then, it was harder and harder to pedal, and his bike was going slower and slower. Just when he thought for sure he was doomed to die and the hound would get him, his bike stopped, the panting stopped, and he found that his back wheel had a flat tire. A flap of rubber had made the panting sound as the air was being released.That has nothing to do with this story, except that it is the reason I read the book. Good book too! Almost as good a story as my grandpa's."
1371,The Iliad,Homer,3.83,278029,4884,Grace Tjan,4,"What I learned from this book (in no particular order):1.	Victory or defeat in ancient Greek wars is primarily the result of marital spats and/or petty sibling rivalry in Zeus and Hera’s dysfunctional divine household.2.	Zeus “the father of gods and men” is a henpecked husband who is also partial to domestic abuse.3.	If you take a pretty girl who is the daughter of a priest of Apollo as war booty and refuse to have her ransomed, Apollo will rain plague on your troops. And he won’t be appeased until you return the girl and throw him a ginormous BBQ party involving hundreds of cattle at his temple.4.	If an arrow or a spear were thrown at you in battle, more often than not, it would land on your nipple or thereabout. Or alternatively, it would pierce your helmet and splatter your brain.5.	Paris is a proper guy’s name, not just a name for capital cities or bratty heiresses.6.	Brad Pitt in man skirt* Achilles is the badassest warrior there ever was.7.	Real men eat red meat, specifically:				a. sheep chines;				b. fat goats; and				c. the long back cuts of a full-grown pig, marbled with lard.8.	 The most valuable booty are (in no particular order):					a. bronze tripods (each worth 12 oxens) and armors;				b. swift war stallions; and				c. pretty women (each worth 4 oxens, if also skilled in crafts). Lesbians are particularly prized.		9.	There is nothing more glorious for a warrior than to sack enemy cities, plunder their wealth, kill all their men, bed their pretty women and enslave their children. 	10. 	The only men who matter are warriors, but if you are a woman, the range of roles that you could play is rather more diverse. You could be:a.	a runaway wife who sparks a cosmic battle between your thuggish hubby’s city-state and your cowardly boyfriend’s (1);b.	a war booty with a bad case of Stockholm Syndrome (2);c.	a manipulative uber bitch (who also happens to be a goddess) (3);d.	a long-suffering wife and mother (4).(1) Helen	(2) Briseis	(3) Hera	(4) AndromacheBut whatever role you choose to play, you will still be the bone of contention between men and the armies that they lead. All the major conflicts in the story are triggered by women, or specifically by their sexuality: Helen’s elopement with Paris launched a thousand Argive ships against Troy; Agamemnon’s desire to bed Briseis, Achilles’ lawful prize, caused a nearly unhealable rift between them; and Hector’s desire to protect his wife from the dismal fate of being an Argive sex slave inspired him to fight Achilles to the death. Homer’s mortal women might be meek and mild, but his goddesses can kick ass with the best of them, and even occasionally best their male counterparts: Zeus is not above being manipulated by Hera, and Ares the God of War actually got whacked on the head by Athena. *Troy, Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Warner Bros. 2004.What I find most surprising about the Iliad is the amount of graphic, X-rated violence that it contains. The violence is not the biblical slaying and smiting, but something much more voyeuristically gory:“…the one Peneleos lanced beneath the brows, down to the eyes' roots and scooped an eyeball out --- the spear cut clean through the socket, out behind the nape and backward down he sat, both hands stretched wide as Peneleos, quickly drawing his whetted sword, hacked him square in the neck and lopped his head and down on the ground it tumbled, helmet and all. But the big spear's point still stuck in the eye socket ---.""I imagine that this kind of anatomically precise, brain-splattering, gut-spilling action scenes made the Iliad popular with the Romans, who routinely went to the Colosseum to watch gladiators hack each other to death, but there is only so much of it that I could take in one sitting, which is why it took me almost three months to finish it. It is not that I’m particularly sensitive to fictional death and dismemberment --- and after all, this book is a war book --- but the sheer amount of such scenes, as well as their mind-numbing repetitiveness made for tedious reading. It doesn’t help that many of these deaths happened to seemingly throwaway characters, barely introduced in three or four lines, merely to be summarily (and gorily) dispatched in another half a dozen lines on the same page. The Iliad is assumed to be the written version of a much older oral poem, and such characters might represent collective memories of real Bronze Age warriors, but by Zeus, hundreds of pages of them being hacked, cleaved and skewered to death almost did me in.Now, what is the purpose of such meticulously catalogued carnage? Was Homer trying to present War with all its attendant horrors to shock his audience into pacifism? Or was the old guy just trying to write an 8th century BCE equivalent of a blockbuster action-adventure movie with enough gore to satisfy his young male demographic? The Iliad both celebrates and laments the warrior spirit: the haughty pride and terrible thirst for vengeance and plunder that set men to distant shores, intent on razing cities and putting its inhabitants to slaughter, but also the stark, tragic consequences of such acts. I actually find the gods’ politicking and manipulations more interesting than the actual war. The Greek gods are blissfully free of any human notion of morality --- which makes the problem of theodicy much more simpler to solve than in the Judeo-Christian model. The Olympian gods do not move in mysterious ways: they are moved by caprice and petty grievances. Why did we suffer such an ignominious defeat, despite all that we had done to win Zeus’ favor? Well, it happened that just before the battle was about to begin, Hera seduced him and subsequently put him to sleep with the help of Hypnos, whom she bribed with one of the Graces. A perfectly logical and very human explanation.The story gets much more interesting in the last five books. The Olympian gods entered into the fray and the effect is sometimes like watching WWE SmackDown: “Bloody Ares lunged at it now with giant lance and Athena backed away, her powerful hand heftinga boulder off the plain, black, jagged, a ton weightthat men in the old days planted there to make off plowland ---Pallas hurled that boundary-stone at Ares, struck his neck,loosed his limbs, and down he crashed and out over seven acressprawled the enormous god and his mane dragged in the dust.”Or maybe an episode of Super Friends :“How do you have the gall, you shameless bitch,to stand and fight me here? ….But since you’d like a lesson in warfare, Artemis,just to learn, to savor how much stronger I amwhen you engage my power ---“The gods are “deathless”, so you know that there won’t be any lasting harm from their catfight, but the cost of battle to all too mortal men is heavy indeed. This was a time when war was as elemental as they come: no mercy was shown to the enemy on the battlefield, save one that pertained to a warrior’s honor, which was to be buried with full honors by his family and comrades. When mighty, “stallion-breaking” Hector finally succumbed to Achilles in a strangely anticlimactic duel, his father Priam went to Achilles’ camp and“kneeling down beside Achilles, clasped his kneesand kissed his hands, those terrible, man-killing handsthat had slaughtered Priam’s many sons in battle.”Troy’s old king begged for his son’s body, and in the magnificent, poignant last book, Homer showed us the real cost of war, both on the vanquished and the triumphant. By the will of the gods, Achilles’ death would soon follow: his destiny was ultimately no different from the rest of tragic humanity, fated to suffer and die by callous, immoral gods for causes that were entirely beyond their ken.“So the immortals spun our lives that we, we wretched menlive on to bear such torments ---“"

Being the only animal that is conscious of his inevitable mortality, his life’s project is to deny or repress this fear, and hence his need for some kind of a heroism. Every grandiosity, good or evil, is intended to make him transcend death and become immortal.To prove his thesis, Becker resorts to psychoanalysis. The depth and breadth of his understanding of psychoanalysis is truly amazing for someone who doesn’t call himself a psychologist. He wants to put psychoanalysis on a different foundation from which Freud put it on: The primary repression is not sexuality, as Freud said, but our awareness of death.To convince you of this fundamental change, Becker treats you to a rather thorough review of psychoanalysis in order to rearrange it. If you don’t like or don’t understand psychoanalysis, don’t read this book. If you have a love/hate relationship with it (so deeply beautiful, poetic, and philosophical, and yet, so ad-hoc and unscientific), this book will show you more of psychoanalysis’s insight and explanatory powers, and its absurdities.

It shouldn’t come as a surprise then that the solution that Becker suggests towards the end of book for ridding man of his vital lie is what he calls a fusion of psychology and religion: The only way that man can face his fate, deal with the inherent misery of his condition, and achieve his heroism, is to give himself to something outside the physical – call it God or whatever you want.A rather disappointing solution, even though he is not talking about any traditional religion. How can we cure ourselves of our vital lie with an illusion? You can rewrite Freud’s The Future of an Illusion based on Becker’s version of psychoanalysis for a different explanation of why man invented God.

362,Wish You Were Here: The Official Biography of Douglas Adams,Nick  Webb,4.14,2364,55,Astrid,5,"Besides Humphrey Carpenter's Tolkien-biography this is without a doubt one of the best biographies I have ever read - if it isn't actually the best. Nick Webb has caught the mood and mannerism of Douglas Adams to perfection, and anyone who's read Hitchhiker's or any of his other books will recognize the whimsical and charming humor inside this one.Wish You Were Here toes the line between what is personal and what is too personal to tell in a biography, but never once does the author cross it and there's never an uncomfortable moment when you think he's overshared a bit. All the stories he tells, and the natural criticism any imperfect human will be subjected to when their lives are being retold, are treated with the utmost respect and affection for the people in them. All I can say about this book is: read it. If you are familiar with Douglas Adams it will be like befriending him all over again with all his faults and virtues; if you don't know Douglas Adams read it anyway. This is the perfect example of how to write a biography that is truly in the spirit of its subject.Douglas Adams did not like biographies. But I believe that if Douglas Adams had to write an autobiography, it would be exactly like Wish You Were Here."

In the US version of the third novel of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Life, the Universe and Everything, the word 'Belgium' is used to replace the word ""fuck"" which was in the British publication.Apparently Douglas Adams' American publishers thought that some of the language in the book was too crude for Americans and asked him to take out the words 'fuck', 'asshole' and 'shit'. Adams' replaced asshole with kneebiter, shit with swut and fuck with Belgium! Sheer genius.American publishers are pussies.But you can kind of understand why when every now and again in the Feedback group someone whines that books need to be rated for language (not to mention amount of sex and violence) and there are groups devoted to letting people know if words that might upset their members are used. I remember one review where the woman said she went through the book and used a black marker on every single curse word. I hope it wasn't a library book.But still, using Belgium, that was a low blow."

4075,In Search of Memory: The Emergence of a New Science of Mind,Eric R. Kandel,4.07,3417,171,Lewis Weinstein,4,"I'm taking a course at Oxford this summer on ""The Brain and the Senses."" So this is a little extra homework. The idea of memory, where thoughts come from, etc., is fascinating to me. And, many years ago, before I was there, Kandel had his laboratory at the Public Health Research Institute, of which I was later CEO. I'll post more when I get into it.I HAVE NOW COMPLETED BOTH THE COURSE AND KANDEL'S BOOK.BOTH WERE TERRIFIC!The course, offered by Oxford tutor Gillie McNeill, combined descriptions of sensory processes with an explanation of the underlying molecular activity that integrates the incoming perceptions and what's already in memory to create a coherent narrative.We started by eating a cracker and considering what was involved in our individual perceptions of that event ... taste, smell, sight, feel, sound, and memory of crackers and herbs previously ingested. Quite a bit for the first few minutes of the course.Kandel’s book offers enchanting glimpses of his life story, the history of brain psychology and science, and a description of the experiments (of Kandel and others) which are moving our understanding of the brain forward at an incredible pace while also revealing just how little we still know.Kandel’s decision, early in his career, to begin his life’s work with the study of a single cell, set the stage for the way he approached his work. He decided to study the giant marine snail Aplysia as his first means to understand how information was brought into a cell and transferred out to another cell. Learn how that happens, multiply by tens of billions, and you have a working human brain.These quotes may communicate the excitement of Kandel’s journey (which by the way led to a Nobel prize)...“the realization that the workings of the brain - the ability not only to perceive but to think, learn, and store information - may occur through chemical as well as electrical signals expanded the appeal of brain science from anatomists and electro-physiologists to biochemists.”“I was testing the idea that the cellular mechanisms underlying learning and memory are likely to have been conserved through evolution and therefore to be found in simple animals.”“We pointed out the importance of discovering what actually goes on at the level of the synapse (the place where signals are passed from one cell to another) when behavior is modified by learning.”This last quote is almost a synopsis of what the course at the Oxford Experience was about. It turns out that there is considerable growth and change in the brain connections and that this goes on all the time. Your brain has changed since you started reading this review."

It was this book that influenced me to consciously live as meaningful a life as possible, to place a great value on the journey and not just the destination, while knowing that ""meaningful"" doesn't always mean ""enjoyable"".

4079,Hooded Murder,Annette Van Dyke,4,2,2,Mel,3,"I bought a 2nd hand copy of this from the Gay's the Word bookshop as it was a lesbian mystery I'd not heard of with a university setting I thought it might be quite interesting. Unfortunately it really wasn't. Mostly the book was about all the infighting between the different lesbian professors at the university. It focused almost entirely on the bad review process of the main character and the murders seemed like an afterthought. For most of the book they get only a couple of paragraphs mention and then are suddenly brought up again at the end of the book as it's quickly solved as a result of only one or two things that were briefly mentioned earlier. The other problem with the book is so much of the information is related second hand. Rather than having a plot and characters develop by meeting people and having them do things instead what happens largely consists of the main character telling her partner what happened and who the people she met were. As a result it was quite difficult to keep characters straight. One always wore birkenstocks, one was a bitch. But apart from that... If you are interested in the infighting in a pretentious and backwards mid West American University you'd like this. If you are looking for a mystery then i's best to be avoided."
4071,Search for Significance: Seeing Your True Worth Through God's Eyes (Student),Jack  Crabtree,4.2,4441,148,Heidi Bylsma,5,"God has used this book, in conjunction with two others, to help me see so many ways in which I had been living a lie in my Christian life. God has used McGee's words to ""shine the light"" on my very performance oriented approach to life. God has exposed my fear of failure, my tendency toward perfectionism and many other ways in which I have ""bought in"" to the Enemy's plan. This book is rooted in scripture and I found the author's handling of the bible responsible and appropriate. In fact, don't miss that the entire back half of the book is a  workbook designed to be worked through at the same time as the chapters are read. There are scriptures galore and many opportunities to sit at the feet of God and prayerfully evaluate what the author says. Never before had I seen such thoughtful, thorough study of such lofty concept as ""propitiation"" and ""justification"" (and more) and begun to see just how these concepts applied to my life now in refuting the lies of the enemy. I truly have experienced a transformation that I never would have imagined.Not just ""theoretical,"" this book has also been extremely practical for me. God has used this book and the things he showed me about my life to keep me from making an enormous mistake by leaving my church. I had no idea just how much my living, reacting, and responding to many things was out of my past until God showed me through this material. In doing this, in working through the material in this book, I have peace in a situation I never could have imagined. In fact, I am resolved, committed, more than I have ever been.To break free from a performance-oriented approach to life flies in the face of everything in our culture and, sadly enough, in our churches often times. But there is nothing like it. God has transformed my life and my ministry and this book has been pivotal, helping me to understand scriptural teachings that I didn't have clarity about."
4076,In Search of Excellence: Lessons from America's Best-Run Companies,Tom Peters,3.91,10269,151,Scott Dinsmore,4,"Why I Read this Book: I was interested to know what it is that makes companies excellent. If I plan to do any type of work at all, be it start a business or work for one, it is fundamental to understand how the great companies of the world have done it.Review:Most of you have probably heard of McKinsey & Company, Inc. For those of you who have not, let me quickly note that McKinsey & Company is the most prestigious top tier management and strategic consulting firm in this world. The majority of its clients are of similar rank and stature. Thomas J. Peters and Robert H. Waterman, the two authors of this book, have many years of combined experience working at McKinsey & Company. This experience led them to decide to go out and find the most successful companies in existence and understand what values, principles and techniques made them this way. This was their “search of excellence”.I had the pleasure of growing up around my father who spent the first part of his career after business school at McKinsey & Company while Waterman and Peters were in their tenure. Many of the stories he has shared over the years relate back to what he learned being around what he describes as “the sharpest and brightest people in the world”. As far as I’m concerned, the road to McKinsey & Company lead him to a rarely-traveled place in the world that he may not have seen otherwise.Tom Peters and Bob Waterman are amazing. As you read through the often dense, but intriguing chapters full of examples and stories from the best run companies in the world, you will begin to notice that only a very small bit of their findings are really groundbreaking. You might say “sure, that obviously makes sense” and “I would do that if I ran a company”. As we should all know by now, common sense is not common practice. My guess is that most companies, both large and small, know these fundamentals and best practices. The key difference between being good and being excellent is that few companies have been able to take that knowledge and transform it into reality and in turn into excellence. This is the true story of the ones that did.What is most valuable about this read is that it is the type of book that can relate to any business situation that you encounter whether you are the employee or the boss and owner. This book was written over 20 years ago and it is still 100% relevant and applicable to business as we know it today. It is to every single person’s advantage to understand what it takes to be excellent. You may not be in charge of a big company, you may not be in charge of a big division, and you may not even be in charge of a small company or division. What is important to remember is that at any and every point in your life, you are in charge of the success of something. I can assure you that you will always be in charge of something in your career. And we all know that we are the presidents and CEO’s of our own success.It is up to us to create and find the excellence in every part of our life. This book provides a perfect modelfor excellence. Read it, understand it, and allow it to live in your business and personal life. I wish you well with your search for excellence. May it never end.-Reading for Your Success"

1373,Iliad,Homer,3.83,278052,4884,Grace Tjan,4,"What I learned from this book (in no particular order):1.	Victory or defeat in ancient Greek wars is primarily the result of marital spats and/or petty sibling rivalry in Zeus and Hera’s dysfunctional divine household.2.	Zeus “the father of gods and men” is a henpecked husband who is also partial to domestic abuse.3.	If you take a pretty girl who is the daughter of a priest of Apollo as war booty and refuse to have her ransomed, Apollo will rain plague on your troops. And he won’t be appeased until you return the girl and throw him a ginormous BBQ party involving hundreds of cattle at his temple.4.	If an arrow or a spear were thrown at you in battle, more often than not, it would land on your nipple or thereabout. Or alternatively, it would pierce your helmet and splatter your brain.5.	Paris is a proper guy’s name, not just a name for capital cities or bratty heiresses.6.	Brad Pitt in man skirt* Achilles is the badassest warrior there ever was.7.	Real men eat red meat, specifically:				a. sheep chines;				b. fat goats; and				c. the long back cuts of a full-grown pig, marbled with lard.8.	 The most valuable booty are (in no particular order):					a. bronze tripods (each worth 12 oxens) and armors;				b. swift war stallions; and				c. pretty women (each worth 4 oxens, if also skilled in crafts). Lesbians are particularly prized.		9.	There is nothing more glorious for a warrior than to sack enemy cities, plunder their wealth, kill all their men, bed their pretty women and enslave their children. 	10. 	The only men who matter are warriors, but if you are a woman, the range of roles that you could play is rather more diverse. You could be:a.	a runaway wife who sparks a cosmic battle between your thuggish hubby’s city-state and your cowardly boyfriend’s (1);b.	a war booty with a bad case of Stockholm Syndrome (2);c.	a manipulative uber bitch (who also happens to be a goddess) (3);d.	a long-suffering wife and mother (4).(1) Helen	(2) Briseis	(3) Hera	(4) AndromacheBut whatever role you choose to play, you will still be the bone of contention between men and the armies that they lead. All the major conflicts in the story are triggered by women, or specifically by their sexuality: Helen’s elopement with Paris launched a thousand Argive ships against Troy; Agamemnon’s desire to bed Briseis, Achilles’ lawful prize, caused a nearly unhealable rift between them; and Hector’s desire to protect his wife from the dismal fate of being an Argive sex slave inspired him to fight Achilles to the death. Homer’s mortal women might be meek and mild, but his goddesses can kick ass with the best of them, and even occasionally best their male counterparts: Zeus is not above being manipulated by Hera, and Ares the God of War actually got whacked on the head by Athena. *Troy, Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Warner Bros. 2004.What I find most surprising about the Iliad is the amount of graphic, X-rated violence that it contains. The violence is not the biblical slaying and smiting, but something much more voyeuristically gory:“…the one Peneleos lanced beneath the brows, down to the eyes' roots and scooped an eyeball out --- the spear cut clean through the socket, out behind the nape and backward down he sat, both hands stretched wide as Peneleos, quickly drawing his whetted sword, hacked him square in the neck and lopped his head and down on the ground it tumbled, helmet and all. But the big spear's point still stuck in the eye socket ---.""I imagine that this kind of anatomically precise, brain-splattering, gut-spilling action scenes made the Iliad popular with the Romans, who routinely went to the Colosseum to watch gladiators hack each other to death, but there is only so much of it that I could take in one sitting, which is why it took me almost three months to finish it. It is not that I’m particularly sensitive to fictional death and dismemberment --- and after all, this book is a war book --- but the sheer amount of such scenes, as well as their mind-numbing repetitiveness made for tedious reading. It doesn’t help that many of these deaths happened to seemingly throwaway characters, barely introduced in three or four lines, merely to be summarily (and gorily) dispatched in another half a dozen lines on the same page. The Iliad is assumed to be the written version of a much older oral poem, and such characters might represent collective memories of real Bronze Age warriors, but by Zeus, hundreds of pages of them being hacked, cleaved and skewered to death almost did me in.Now, what is the purpose of such meticulously catalogued carnage? Was Homer trying to present War with all its attendant horrors to shock his audience into pacifism? Or was the old guy just trying to write an 8th century BCE equivalent of a blockbuster action-adventure movie with enough gore to satisfy his young male demographic? The Iliad both celebrates and laments the warrior spirit: the haughty pride and terrible thirst for vengeance and plunder that set men to distant shores, intent on razing cities and putting its inhabitants to slaughter, but also the stark, tragic consequences of such acts. I actually find the gods’ politicking and manipulations more interesting than the actual war. The Greek gods are blissfully free of any human notion of morality --- which makes the problem of theodicy much more simpler to solve than in the Judeo-Christian model. The Olympian gods do not move in mysterious ways: they are moved by caprice and petty grievances. Why did we suffer such an ignominious defeat, despite all that we had done to win Zeus’ favor? Well, it happened that just before the battle was about to begin, Hera seduced him and subsequently put him to sleep with the help of Hypnos, whom she bribed with one of the Graces. A perfectly logical and very human explanation.The story gets much more interesting in the last five books. The Olympian gods entered into the fray and the effect is sometimes like watching WWE SmackDown: “Bloody Ares lunged at it now with giant lance and Athena backed away, her powerful hand heftinga boulder off the plain, black, jagged, a ton weightthat men in the old days planted there to make off plowland ---Pallas hurled that boundary-stone at Ares, struck his neck,loosed his limbs, and down he crashed and out over seven acressprawled the enormous god and his mane dragged in the dust.”Or maybe an episode of Super Friends :“How do you have the gall, you shameless bitch,to stand and fight me here? ….But since you’d like a lesson in warfare, Artemis,just to learn, to savor how much stronger I amwhen you engage my power ---“The gods are “deathless”, so you know that there won’t be any lasting harm from their catfight, but the cost of battle to all too mortal men is heavy indeed. This was a time when war was as elemental as they come: no mercy was shown to the enemy on the battlefield, save one that pertained to a warrior’s honor, which was to be buried with full honors by his family and comrades. When mighty, “stallion-breaking” Hector finally succumbed to Achilles in a strangely anticlimactic duel, his father Priam went to Achilles’ camp and“kneeling down beside Achilles, clasped his kneesand kissed his hands, those terrible, man-killing handsthat had slaughtered Priam’s many sons in battle.”Troy’s old king begged for his son’s body, and in the magnificent, poignant last book, Homer showed us the real cost of war, both on the vanquished and the triumphant. By the will of the gods, Achilles’ death would soon follow: his destiny was ultimately no different from the rest of tragic humanity, fated to suffer and die by callous, immoral gods for causes that were entirely beyond their ken.“So the immortals spun our lives that we, we wretched menlive on to bear such torments ---“"
5084,My Life in France,Julia Child,4.16,68148,6575,Kelly,4,"I did not grow up on Julia Child. I’m too young to have watched her TV show, and my mom wasn’t the type to own any of her cookbooks (we stuck to mostly Italian recipes handed down from my dad’s mom and ranch-style cooking- or, if we were unlucky, my British nanny’s “traditional” English dishes she insisted we try). I barely knew who she was before I started cooking a few years ago. I admit that I wasn’t really interested in her until the recent movie Julie and Julia, which definitely made me want to know more. What can I say? Meryl Streep’s powers are infinite.I say this just so you’re aware that I don’t have any childhood memories that mean that this book is illuminated in a shiny, impenetrable blanket of nostalgia (not that there is anything wrong with those blankets. I have them for other things! Just not for this). Nonetheless, I really liked this book. I don’t want to overstate this. The book is what it says it is, and you should sign up for it because you would like to read about what Julia Child did in France, what came of her trip in France, the writing of French cookbooks, and how she got started as The French Chef. There is food, and a lot of it. Everything from incredibly detailed memories of menus she ate or cooked for people in France in 1950, to explanations of her experiments with translating French foods to the American market to the trials and tribulations of publishing her cookbook. So far, so expected. And, frankly, so good. She is excellent at describing a sense memory of taste so that even if you’re not quite sure what a dish is, you’re very sure that you want to eat it.The unexpected part, which I loved, was Julia’s personal transformation. I don’t necessarily mean the inspirational tale of finding happiness in going native in a foreign country that inspired a thousand imitators of the Under the Tuscan Sun variety. I meant the other side of the story, her prickly growth as a person. The way these stories are told (and it should be noted that they are written by her great-nephew, though with her approval), her very distinctive voice seems to express not only the sort of warmth and charm that drew people to her, but also the other woman hiding behind that. I really identified with that other woman that she seemed embarrassed to talk about too much. She was the girl who was smart and restless enough to long for more than the slot that life had lined up for her (housewife in unthinking Republican Pasadena), but, so it seemed, with a self-esteem low enough that she didn’t think herself as smart as the artsy, literate people that she longed to be around (like her husband). I could relate to that- I've been that girl. Forever in-between in your own mind, not good enough for what you want, but knowing you need more than what would be acceptable. It was fascinating to hear her talk about politics of the time period (and this was a surprisingly political book), whether French or American- and then stop herself with one of her patented sweet exclamations (“Phooey!”, “Whew!”)- as if she was suddenly self-conscious of talking about something that she was not an expert about and didn’t want people to think she was getting above herself or something. She was extremely self-aware about her limits, too. There was a wonderful passage from when she was about 40 or so when she was arguing with a man of conservative opinions when she realized that she had “emotions instead of opinions,” which was why she couldn’t express herself very well. She didn’t come out and say it, but it seemed implied that she was still a young girl rebelling emotionally against her Republican father- which had seemed to her sufficient opinion until that point. She immediately resolved to educate herself and read, with Paul, a wide assortment of French and American newspapers. How many people are willing to admit that kind of ignorance and take on such a deep project of self-improvement at that age? In my experience, that seems to be about the time where people start to get set in their ways and are all, “Oh well, too late not to suck at life now!” Once she had found her new passion, she also became the most amazingly hard worker. She spent months perfecting a mayonnaise recipe that no one had ever written down, and then had to find a way to translate it to an American market that has ingredients that make for a completely different chemistry. She was the first person to write down a recipe for French bread in English, and it took her over 200 pounds of flour to get it right. She wrote to scientists who worked with Hershey’s to get a demonstration of the chemical reactions of chocolate. It was the most amazing thing- like she finally found a little niche that she could make herself have enough self-confidence to succeed in, despite her doubts, and suddenly we find out that she’s probably way smarter than the people she’s been writing about in awe the entire book, whether chefs or otherwise. She eats this amazing meal when she first arrives in France that starts her on this journey towards her ultimate career as a French chef, and about halfway through the book (and twenty years later), she goes out to a restaurant and has another amazing meal- but instead of reacting in awe and worshiping the magic of the French character, she guesses, accurately, everything that is in the dish and goes home and reproduces it almost exactly, and it is just as good as the lady in her restaurant who has been making this dish since the dawn of time. The way she talks about her obsession with these details of why food works is still almost…defensive, like she had to explain it to someone a half-century later, when she's been proven right about having done it over and over again. It’s so true- once the insecure girl who is too tall, too smart, too something- always that girl, successful or not. Ultimately, you love her because she always brings things back to this place of happiness and, “oh well, the show must go on!” no matter what- but the way she told the stories and negotiated herself to that place was very realistic. This was not an unrelenting “always look on the bright side of life,” montage. There were difficult people in her life, difficult spots in her marriage, difficult moments in her career- the fact that she still remembers verbatim quotes and fights from forty years earlier is telling- and she’s clear about it when she doesn’t like something or someone and why. She doesn’t have an American sense of everything will turn out all right in the end, but rather this very French tant pis acceptance that shit happens and life is shit and oh well, wade through it like a big girl. She doesn’t try to deny anything or erase it or obsess about appearing perfect when she wasn’t- which is something I find irritating about American self-help books and TV fantasies. Her philosophy about serving your food even if it comes out bad and not apologizing for is sort of the epitome of this rejection of the hide your dirty laundry ideals of the mid-century. She’s perfectly frank about her fights with Paul Child, her problems with her co-authors on the book, her difficulties with her Republican father, her failures in the kitchen and on her TV show. It isn’t in the exhibitionist way that you see so often these days either. She’s a good girl, but she won’t let herself be walked all over- she is going to have her say and that’s just fair. I don’t know if I am doing a very good job describing this voice, but believe me when I say that it is as captivating in print as it is on television.All in all, a surprisingly down to earth book from a classy lady who was much more complicated than I thought she was. Come for the food, stay for the voice of the woman telling you about it- and don’t let her talk herself down! She’s worth the price of admission and more."
9320,Allen Carr's Easy Way for Women to Stop Smoking,Allen Carr,3.99,529,55,Peachy,4,"Yippee, I'm freeeee!!!If you are or ever have been a smoker, I’m sure by now you’ve heard of Allen Carr and his apparent ‘Easy Way’ to quit smoking. He has written several editions of his book outlining his philosophies relating to quitting the evil nicotine, and has helped thousands of smokers worldwide to quit the nasty habit for good. With his astonishing success rate in mind, and a desperate need to quit this disgusting habit that I’ve had for over seventeen years, I decided to pick up Carr’s Easy Way for Women to Stop Smoking. Carr’s basic premise is that the addiction that we have to smoking is comprised of very little outside of the brainwashing sustained at the hands of the major tobacco companies. He feels that the actual physical addiction to nicotine, what he refers to as the “little monster,” is minor, remaining no more than three or four days upon quitting. The lasting but still beatable combatant would be what he calls the “big monster,” the brainwashing by the tobacco companies, mentioned above. Carr insists that considering smoking a habit, feeling that you enjoy some cigarettes more than others (i.e. after a meal), and believing that smoking relaxes you, cures boredom or relieves stress is all part and parcel of the brainwashing ploy that we’ve fallen victim to for over a century. He believes that reversing this brainwashing and seeing the truth in all of the lies is the key to rid yourself of smoking, as opposed to the sure-to-fail willpower method that so many of us have faltered on. I must admit that the book did provide for a profound change on how I view my addiction to this filthy, cancer-causing imprisonment that I’ve been bound to for so many years. I immediately felt compelled to smoke my last cigarette and move on to a healthier, happier and free existence as a non-smoker. With nothing but good intentions I followed his plan and bid it farewell. I lasted about 18 hours, and then buckled to a half-smoked butt that my fiancé had left in our balcony ashtray. Determined not to be defeated, I did not let myself succumb to the feelings of failure that were lurking in my mind, and with a little brainwashing of my own I was appropriately convinced that everyone is entitled to a slipup. I got back on the wagon with the notion that tomorrow is a new day. It has been six days now, and aside from the first couple of days where I had a few drags to calm the “little monster,” I have eliminated smoking from my daily routine. Yippee! I will not pretend that this happened without a heavy dose of willpower on my part, because I was most definitely white-knuckling it through the first couple of days. In this respect, as well as his downplaying of the physical withdrawal symptoms experienced, I feel that Carr slightly misrepresents the ease of quitting smoking. Unless of course, I am just an unlucky person who went through an extraordinary difficulty in quitting, but I doubt that very much, especially since I was down to approximately 15 cigarettes a day when I finally cut them out. That being said, I am thankful to Carr’s book for pointing out my error in buying in to society and its brainwashing surrounding smoking, I just find it hard to believe that willpower doesn’t come into play when quitting anything that there is a physical addiction to, no matter how minor. I truly believe that I have rid myself of the mind-games that have kept me picking up a cigarette when I’m stressed-out or bored, because I now realize that the only reason smoking addresses these things is because of the underlying physical addiction that leaves me feeling insecure and in need of something. I understand that once this “little monster” is put to death I will actually be able to deal with stress and boredom better, without a craving for nicotine getting in the way. It is because of these important realizations that I am truly thankful to have read Allen Carr’s book and would recommend it to anyone that is seriously ready to save their lives and quit this disastrous habit.

(البته حتما تعداد بسیار زیادی شکست خورده هم وجود داره که طبق معمول دیده نمی شن)شیوه‌های رایج ترک سیگار مثل آدامس و برچسب نیکوتین اعتیاد به دخانیات رو نتیجه 1-عادت 2-اعتیاد جسمانی به نیکوتین می دونند و در این راستا ابتدا تلاش می کنن با ایجاد یک جایگزین برای سیگار عادت به سیگار رو از بین ببرند و بعد با کم کردن دوز نیکوتین اعتیاد فیزیکی رو. ولی واقعیت اینه که اعتیاد به نیکوتین شبیه اعتیاد به روان‌گردان ها می مونه، اعتیاد جسمی خیلی ناچیز و خفیف و اعتیاد روانی بسیار بزرگی داره. متد این کتاب به این صورت هست که اول به اعتیاد روانی (هیولای بزرگ) حمله‌ور می شه و سعی می کنه خیلی منطقی شست و شو‌های مغزی سیگار‌ی‌ها رو از بین ببره و در مرحله بعدی کار اعتیاد جسمی (هیولای کوچک) رو یک‌سره و تمام کنه. نکته مهم اینه که تقریبا اکثر سیگاری‌ها هرچقدرم که از سیگار متنفر باشن باز هم از کنار گذاشتن و نبود اون به ده‌‌ها دلیل منطقی و غیرمنطقی می ترسن، اما چون نویسنده خودش تمام این ترس‌ها رو تجربه کرده و در متن کتاب هم آورده، به این ترس سیگاری ها دامن نمی زنه و به همین دلیل خوندن و به پایان رسوندن کتاب برای کسی که اون رو بدستش گرفت کار سختی نیستپیشنهاد منچیزی تحت عنوان مصرف تفریحی سیگار وجود نداره. ما یا سیگاری نیستیم، یعنی به هیچ عنوان سیگار نمی کشیم یا سیگاری هستیم، یعنی ماهی یک نخ یا هفته‌ای یک نخ یا روزی یکی دو پاکت سیگار می کشیم. اگر با این دسته‌بندی در جرگه سیگاری‌ها قرار می‌گیرد توصیه اکید می کنم که به جای استفاده از شیوه‌ی ""قدرت اراده"" و آدامس و چسب نیکوتین و الکترواسموک، این کتاب رو بخونید. اگر هم تصمیم به ترک ندارید باز هم این کتاب رو بخونید. طرز فکر و نگاه شما رو به سیگار تغییر می ده و حداقل دیگه نه با گول زدن خود، بلکه آگاهانه سیگار می کشید"
9325,"Fullmetal Alchemist, Vol. 10 (Fullmetal Alchemist, #10)",Hiromu Arakawa,4.6,7237,116,Caroline,5,CAN I just say how much I love the little extras at the end of each volume?! They are always so funny and cute and I LOVE THEM SO MUCH! Also this volume was excellent! So many of the characters I love were in danger and it was seriously giving me heart trouble. The fight scenes were amazing and I think the art style is so awesome. I'm starting to really love Roy Mustang (it's taken a while!) because he cares so much about his team and is a badass in fights. The ending was really good as always with this manga so now I'm super excited to keep reading and find out what happens with Edward and his father.
2708,The Life of Geoffrey Chaucer: A Critical Biography,Derek Albert Pearsall,3.6,25,7,Tom,3,"Densely packed with information, there is a lot to take in on each page. I liked Pearsall's style previously, having encountered him through Langland criticism and his edition of the C text of Piers Plowman. This did not disappoint in that regard. Pearsall is remarkably knowledgeable about the period and demonstrates this. He can also be blunt and assertive, and adds small touches of humour to his analysis which makes otherwise fairly dry topics rather readable. I feel my knowledge and understanding of Chaucer's body of work as a whole has been enhanced, which is the point of a general literary biography. However, analysis of each text was disappointingly brief, and I feel this could have stood to be a little longer than it was in order to add more depth."
2709,Geoffrey Chaucer's The Pardoner's Tale,Harold Bloom,4,5,1,Britni B,5,"I recently bought the Canterbury Tales book interpreted by Frank Ernest Hill. The Pardoner's Tale is by far my favorite tale in the book. I feel Chaucer has made a way of scaring God in to people by saying sin will be the demise of man (which, we all know of anyway). It's a great story, and has some humor in the fact that while two of the character are plotting to kill a third one, the third one is plotting to kill the duo. It's ironic - but it's a great story and so far my favorite one in the book!"
2721,The No-Salt Cookbook: Reduce or Eliminate Salt Without Sacrificing Flavor,David C. Anderson,3.51,35,3,"Amy ""the book-bat""",4,"My doctor suggested that I try to reduce the amount of salt in my diet. As someone who generally doesn't use salt at the table, I know that the majority of the sodium in my diet comes from other food sources. What I like about this cookbook is that it gives plenty of suggestions for substitutions for salt within recipes and also explains why some foods that many people believe can not be made without salt actually can be. Basically, it is about retraining our taste buds to not want the salt so much. A lot of the recipes sound pretty good and seem like they would be easy to make and I plan to try some soon."
2710,Chaucer's Canterbury Tales,Geoffrey Chaucer,3.48,159734,2675,MJ Nicholls,4,"When confronted with the painful choice of whether or not to read Chaucer in the original Middle English, I agonised for precisely four seconds and decided to read Nevill Coghill’s modern translation in lovely Penguin paperback. In the same way I wouldn’t learn German to read Goethe, or unlearn English to read Dan Brown, I refuse to learn archaic forms of English for pointless swotty scholar-points, and grope instead for selfish readerly pleasure, two-fingering the purists and bunking down with Mr. Nevill for nights of sumptuous moral homily, proto-feminist romantic comedy, and high courtly drama. For Chaucer neophytes like me, this text captures the bouncy humour and devilish cleverness of the original (not that I would know!), and hopefully will turn a generation of frightened and unenlightened readers on to this master of verse. (And if you must know, my rhyming homage review was lost due to a power failure and a more tempting invitation to eat pilaf rice with Brian. Street children! Wives of Bath! Go forth and Chaucerize!)"
5206,House of Sand and Fog,Andre Dubus III,3.83,105846,3606,Jeffrey Keeten,5,"“And that's what I wanted: obliteration. Decimation. Just an instant smear of me right out of all this rising and falling and nothing changing that feels like living.” In the beginning there was Kathy Nicolo. She is an addict who has been through a drug rehabilitation program. She has been flying straight for a while. She cleans houses for a modest living. She spends most of her free time watching movies, one after the other. All is going okay until she has a dispute with the county over the house her father left her and her brother. They claim she owes back taxes. She goes down to the county offices and gets it “sorted out”, but she continues to get letters from the county office which she promptly throws away without opening. Anybody who has ever dealt with any level of bureaucracy knows that issues are not always “sorted out” the first time. The problem is that Kathy doesn’t have much experience dealing with anything. She avoids, evades, and hits the escape hatch any time anything gets too real. The next thing she knows the cops are on her doorstep explaining to her that she has an order to vacate. Her property has been seized. She meets Deputy Sheriff Lester Burdon as he is escorting her off her property. She can tell by the way he is looking at her that he is attracted to her. She is pretty, waifish, and vulnerable. He has a wife and two kids, but every time he makes love with his wife it feels like he is making out with his sister. They are best friends, comfortable with each other, and like a lot of people he interprets that to mean the spark is gone from the marriage. Kathy, as he soon finds out, is much more than a spark. She is more like a full on raging forest fire. The county sells her property quickly. This is where Colonel Massoud Behrani enters the plot. He and his family were lucky to escape Iran when the Shah is ousted. He was high enough up in the government to see his name appear on the blacklists. His wife has never really forgiven him for the circumstances that have made them immigrants in America. They did escape with some money, but much of that has been eaten up by keeping up appearances with the community of Persians in California. Behrani works two crappy jobs, one picking up trash along the highways and the other as a late night convenience clerk. Both jobs that are difficult to hire Americans to do at any price. “For our excess we lost everything.”It is no wonder to me that immigrants excel in the United States. They take chances. They work hard. They don’t expect anything for nothing. Behrani is no exception and when Kathy’s house comes up for auction he takes the last of their savings and buys the house. As it turns out he is also lucky that only two other bidders show up and he buys the house for a fraction of the value. Now I say lucky, but I always feel we make our own luck. Luck never just happens, you have to give luck a chance to reward you. In his mind he can already see the real estate empire that this first house will help finance. Kathy and Lester hit it off. ”I felt a little better as I pulled the T-shirt over my head and caught the faint scent of vomit and gun oil. Me and Lester.” They are screwing like bunnies and when they are together everything is fine, but when they are apart it becomes readily apparent that their relationship is built out of sand. He starts thinking about how easily she fell into bed with him. She starts thinking he is going to go back to his wife and kids. Kathy really hates the idea of Colonel Behrani and his family in HER house. The county admits it made a mistake, but the sales transaction with Behrani is legal. He would have to agree to sell the house back to the county for what he paid for it. His visions of a hefty profit float up into the fog. Kathy isn’t adhering to the program. ”And I knew to any of my counselors back East my life wouldn’t look very manageable; I was drinking again, and smoking; I was sleeping with a man who’d just left his family, all while I was supposed to be getting back the house I’d somehow lost. I knew they would call the drinking a slip, the smoking a crutch, the love making ‘sex as medication,’ and the house fiasco a disaster my lack of recovery had invited upon itself, and on me.” Embracing those addictions is making her unstable world spin faster while her mind spins slower. It is an unusual situation with all parties being victims of an unresolvable issue with the county. Given what we know about Behrani he isn’t who Kathy thinks he is. Kathy isn’t really who he thinks she is either. As the plot advances we also find out that Lester isn’t who anyone thinks he is either. Of course, Kathy is like nitroglycerin in his head. It always amazes me how one little mistake can lead to such complete chaos. Andre Dubus III keeps adding snakes to the plot until it is all so twisted together that only the sword of Alexander the Great will untie it. Dubus reveals all the characters, even the second tier characters, with such depth that I felt like I know these people. My mind even now is still weighing all the ramifications from everyone’s decisions as if this is an ongoing crisis that is still yet to be resolved.  Andre Dubus has done his homework on this very American novel.I enjoyed the real estate aspects of the plot. I also liked the way that Dubus has us ride along with each character giving us free access to their inner thoughts, their hopes, and desires. He also shows how many chances people get to turn their life around. The many hands that are outstretched to keep them from falling too far. Sometimes it just doesn’t matter how much help someone receives they continue to make the same bad decisions until tragedy overtakes them sometimes with equally tragic results for others. They made a movie out of this book in 2003. I’ve not seen the film. I, as usual, skipped the film until I had a chance to read the book. From what I’ve read about the movie they significantly changed the ending, leaving some very important and pivotal scenes in the book out of the plot of the movie. I’m not discouraged because I know that films are a different entity from the book that inspired them. I will report back after watching the movie.

5207,Daughter of Fortune: A Novel,Isabel Allende,3.89,97576,3182,Brina,5,"According to Isabel Allende, the timeless tale she weaves in House of the Spirits begins with the story of Eliza Sommers in Daughter of Fortune. Eliza Sommers is found in a basket as a newborn baby at the Valparaiso, Chile home of Jeremy and Rose Sommers (brother and sister). Rose is only 20 years old but resigned to spinsterhood and immediately feels compassion for the child, takes her in, and decides to raise her like a daughter, much to the admonition of her brother.We fast forward our tale 16 years. Rose has brought up Eliza to be a young lady worthy of English aristocracy. Eliza has also spent time in the presence of the Del Valle family of Chilean upper class who will play a role in the entire trilogy. Yet, she feels stifled in this life others have chosen for her, so when she encounters Joaquin Andieta for the first time, she is instantly smitten. Andieta is a bastard child with no future in Chile and succumbs to gold fever, leaving for California. He leaves Eliza pregnant, so she decides to take all the jewels meant for her trousseau and runs away from home, determined to find her lover.The second half of the novel takes place in California in Eliza's futile attempt to find Andieta. While a stowaway on a ship, she miscarries and is nursed back to health by a Chinese doctor named Tao Chi'en, who later becomes her life companion. Tao determines that Eliza should dress like a Chinese boy so as not to be discovered, thus beginning their life in America.I enjoyed the historical aspects of life during the California gold rush. Still primarily a wild west inhabited by native Americans, California attracts people from all over the world in search of fortune: Chinese, Russians, Australians, Chileans, Peruvians, Mexicans, as well as people from the eastern half of the United States. Because the majority of gold seekers were men, prostitutes struck it rich as well. Eliza posing as a male piano player joins a traveling prostitution troop while Tao makes a name for himself as a healer in Chinatown in San Francisco.While the fortune alluded to in the title could refer to gold, it could also mean the American Dream. During the 1850s, Tao faced a bleak future in China as a fourth son, yet emerges in California as a respected member of society. Eliza would have been subservient to a husband in Chile, but works as Tao's assistant and harbors a dream of opening a French patisserie. Meanwhile Paulina de la Santa Cruz nee Del Valle operates a successful steamship company transporting produce and high culture from Chile to California financially independent of her husband. Additionally, Allende briefly touches on the interracial romance of Eliza and Tao, which would not have been tolerated in their home countries, yet accepted in a melting pot society like that of 1850s California.The end of the novel leaves me looking forward to reading its sequel A Portrait in Sepia. It is supposed to bridge the gap between the lives of Eliza and Paulina with the childhood of Clara in House of the Spirits. Because the second half of the book takes place in California rather than Chile, it is devoid of magical realism. This demonstrates to me that Allende is a gifted storyteller in many genres. I am looking forward to completing the trilogy once more and witnesses how she ties all of these stories together."
1336,Plato's Phaedrus: The Philosophy of Love,Graeme Nicholson,4.25,4,2,Robin Friedman,4,"Philosophy And ErosThe Phaedrus is among Plato's deepest and most moving dialogues. It is full of myth, poetry, insight and thought. Even more than is the case with most of Plato, it is difficult to pin this work down to consider it as a treatise on a single subject matter. The dialogue form and Plato's own thinking do not allow such reduction. Broadly speaking, the dialogue deals with the nature of love with this question threaded in with a discussion of the nature of speech and writing and their respective roles in thinking about important questions (such as the nature of love.) The main body of the dialogue consists of three speeches, one a written speech by Lysias, and two oral speeches by Socrates. The speech by Lysias and the first speech of Socrates argue that it is more advantageous for a young person to be wooed by a person who does not love him. Socrates second speech, the pivotal portion of the dialogue, strongly takes issue with this in a discussion of the nature of love, passion (madness), the human soul, and the world of Platonic form.Graeme Nicholson is a professor of philosophy at the University of Toronto and a fellow of Trinity College. His book is a study of the Phaedrus prepared as part of a series of Purdue University Press' History of Philosophy Series, each volume of which is devoted to a detailed consideration of a specific philosophical text. The Phaedrus has received such consideration in other studies (by Charles Griswold, Luc Brisson, Seth Bernadette, among other scholars), but the work is inexhaustible and well deserves the extended treatment it receives here. Nicholson, properly and commendably, philosophizes with Plato. He sees the ancient character of the texts but does not stop there. He tries to show how the Phaedrus, with all its antiquity, addresses problems of modern readers in an important an elucidating way.Nicholson's focus is on the nature of love. Many readers understand Plato to argue that eros is a step on the way to a broader, rationalistic understanding of the ideas. But Nicholson argues well that the Phaedrus reverses this pattern. Plato here sees eros and passion - a commitment to study and to understanding and a fire within one -- as a precondition to any serious endeavor, philosophical or otherwise. Nicholson proceeds to show how this understanding of eros allows Plato in the Phaedrus to take a broader view of the nature of myth, poetry, rhetoric, and music as themselves contributing to and enabling the process of philosophical understanding. I find this a valuable insight into the Phaedrus.Nicholson also has challenging things to say about Plato's concept of being (or of being-beyond-being). He sees this as a spiritual and valuable concept, to simplify broadly, and as an important and, with current explanations and explications, viable antidote to much of the scientism and materialism in contemporary thought and in the assumptions of many people. This too is a valuable and thoughtful way of approaching the Phaedrus.The core of Professor Nicholson's study is Socrates's great speech on love which he presents in Part II of the book in a fresh translation. This translation is followed by a long, careful, exploration in Part III of the various themes of the book. Part I of the book gives background on Plato and on the Phaedrus's relationship to Plato's body of work. There are introductory chapters on myth, rhetoric, dialectic, and writing. All these themes are important to the Phaedrus and they are developed with good use of authority to other Platonic and Greek texts, and to the work of modern philosophers and scholars.The book suffers somewhat but ignoring Plato's own order of presentation. There is this a lack of attention to the dramatic development -- to the manner in which Plato tries to show the interrelationship of the themes of the Phaedrus -- how one leads into another. This is no small task. Thus in the early sections of the book, Professor Nicholson discusses themes that Plato reserves for the end of the dialogue -- such as the nature of dialectic and the relative merits of writing and discussion. (The story of the god Theuth and his gift of writing to the King of Egypt is discussed early in Nicholson, for example, but it appears only at the end of the Phaedrus.) The presentation thus misses some of the opportunities to discuss how Plato and the reader should view the development of the themes in the dialogue.It is good to read the Phaedrus -- or to reread it as the case may be -- in the context of reading and studying this book. I thought the book helped me understand and appreciate the Phaedrus and Plato. This great ancient philosopher has much to teach us.Robin Friedman"
1337,Enthusiasm and Divine Madness,Josef Pieper,4.48,21,3,Jennifer,5,"A brilliant reading of the Phaedrus, as well as a brilliant critique of modern thought, which is so much opposed to the Platonic ideal of divine receptivity.What interests me about Plato's conception of mania, which is complex, is how it problematizes our modern conception of autonomy. Mania, as Pieper demonstrates, is primarily a loss of command over oneself, a surrender of self-control. It is a state of passivity, of being washed over by something sublime and outside of oneself. In fact, in order to be receptive, one must surrender one's autonomy, and be open. Pieper argues, ""Plato never denied, or overlooked the fact, that both autonomy and the shattering of that autonomy are essential to the nature of man."" He writes that ""human nature is so placed within its plane of existence that it remains essentially open to the sphere of the divine. Man is so constituted that, on the one hand, he can be thrown out of the autonomous independence of his thinking by inspiration, which comes to him as a sudden, unpredictable force from outside. On the other hand, this very abandonment of critical sovereignty may bring him an abundance of insight, of light, of truth, of illumination as to the nature of reality which would otherwise remain completely out of his reach. For we are dealing not with self-governing human genius, but with something bestowed by another, a higher or divine power. Nor is this merely an abstract possibility: man's being is at times overpowered by inspiration. It is something that actually happens."" (p. 56)Pieper also traces the role that the encounter with beauty has to transform us; it too can be a kind of mania that ultimately points us to the divine. And it is firmly rooted in sensual eros. A startling and imaginative study. "
9635,The Bradbury Chronicles: The Life of Ray Bradbury,Sam Weller,4.19,341,48,Mark,4,"From his childhood in Waukegan, IL to his teen years in Hollywood, CA and beyond,the life of this extraordinary writer is wonderfully conveyed by Sam Weller. Some interesting facts about the man who often put us aboard rocketships and envisioned the future: He never learned to drive and was afraid to fly (he did eventually get on a plane when he was in his sixties, but never drove a car!). He wrote the screenplay to John Huston's film of ""Moby Dick"" (something I never knew).I read many Bradbury books when I was younger and agree with the criticism that the science in his science fiction tales is pretty weak, but his use of language is remarkable and very poetic. He evokes mood, nostalgia, and a sense of ""humanity"" as well as anyone I've ever read. His work transcends genre fiction (sci-fi, horror, etc...) putting it in the realm of the best that literature has to offer. An excellent bio. of a great writer."
9637,Something Wicked This Way Comes,Ray Bradbury,3.95,72960,4648,Paul Bryant,5,"I read this when I was an insanely romantic teenager and since then the cruel world has beaten all that nonsense out of my brain with bars of iron and wires of barb, and left me bleeding and barfing in a vile ditch, so I should probably not have plucked my old Corgi paperback of Something Wicked out from my most cobwebbed shelf and thought to wander nostalgically recapturing the wonder and enrapturement I once perceived herein. In those faroff days I wanted to be the smile on the bullet, I wanted to be the weathervane, I wanted to run the dark carnival, and above all else I wanted a calliope so I could play mad twisting melodies at three in the morning from the caboose of a train made out of dead men's bones. Instead I got a job in an office, after a few detours, none of which involved a naked living woman in a block of ice. But anyway, when I did reread this book, I could not shake off the growing realisation that none of it made the least bit of sense. Not a single bit. And the dad is a complete steal - it's Atticus Finch back from the dead. And I saw that Ray Bradbury never met a pudding he did not want to over-egg or an emotion he did not want to wring dry. I had grown old. I didn't recognise the place. I didn't know who the boy was who loved this book so much. I knew his name but I couldn't remember his face.It was a bad idea, rereading a book which so knocked me out all those years ago. I'll give it 5 stars for the love I used to have for it, but I don't really recommend it to anyone now. The world has changed and no longer has the stomach for Ray Bradbury's 1950s goldenhued renderings of his own 1920s childhood. So goodbye, then, to Dandelion Wine, another one I loved. What I learned from this book is that Memory Lane has been mined. You walk down that street at your peril."

Като чета Бредбъри никога не знам какво ме чака на завоя…то е .. и сега ще направя странното сравнение, то е като да гледаш Федерер, винаги изящно и дори топката накрая да удари мрежата си е заслужавало вниманието ти.

9629,Zen in the Art of Writing: Essays on Creativity,Ray Bradbury,4.12,10413,1032,بثينة العيسى,4,لماذا راي برادبيري؟ربّما لأنّه من القلّة التي تنظرُ إلى الكتابة بصفتها “لذة ومتعة” عوضًا عن كونها معاناة. لأنَّ تأمّلات راي برادبيري في الكتابة تحتوي طاقة تحفيزية هائلة، لأنّه يحرضنا على تحويل الكتابة إلى لعبة، إلى مدينة ملاهي عملاقة يدلفُ إليها الكاتبُ قفزًا، حيثُ الطفل في داخلك هو الكاتب في داخلك، وينبغي عليك أن تتمسَّك به.يعتبر كتاب “الزِّن في فنٍّ الكتابة” إضافة نوعية إلى المكتبة العربية، وفكرة جديدة نقترحها على الكاتب العربي، لكي يتخفّف من بعض الكليشيهات المرافقة لهويته الكتابية (البؤس والمعاناة)، وليضفي على رحلته الكتابية الكثير من الانتعاش.فخورة بهذا الكتاب، وسعيدة لأنني كنت جزءا من الفريق الذي ساهم في ترجمته. أتمنى أن يعجبكم.
9636,Early from the Dance,David     Payne,4.16,341,38,Camie,3,"This bittersweet coming of age tale told in masterful prose centers around a love triangle between Adam, Jane, and Cary three naive teenagers from North Carolina who start out as life long friends but who run into big trouble when they become mesmerized by a group of older glamorous people who arrive to run a flashy resort on the Outer Shore. Not much plot here, but plenty of angst, drug use, and sex, in this story of friendship, love , betrayal, and disillusionment . If one summer could be called ""the dance "" the characters who participate this year will find their lives forever changed when due to their own actions someone they care about deeply is to be called away early. My first read by David Payne, whose writing in the Southern tradition has been compared to Pat Conroy. I liked his writing style more here than his subject matter. 3.5 stars"
9631,Something Wicked This Way Comes & A Sound of Thunder,Ray Bradbury,4.05,523,77,aPriL does feral sometimes,4,"Dark is truly a scary monster. I cannot think of a more horrifying image than skin being covered with crawling, squirming images that seethe and move deeper under the flesh and surge out in the next moment. One spider crawling up my arm is enough to give me a fit. In movies, an illuminated man usually is pictured as a tattooed man - but that is not what Bradbury created here. This being's skin literally crawls around because of multitudes of images being alive. (Plus, Dark enslaves souls because he feeds on their suffering, and age is not a consideration - he'll take children as well as men and women.) I know I've become jaded to horrific visual special effects in movies. Under the skin crawlies or burns or bloody tears are common. But I've never seen this holographic/maggoty effect done except for where a tattoo of an eagle or other single creature pulls away from the skin and flies off. The other movie effect is some maggots or similar insect-like creatures which bump around under the flesh. But maggoty-like moving faces that seeth and crawl on the skin? It brought to mind a particular Doctor Who episode, which was also creepy, but I think Bradbury's creation was far worse.Now that I've completely freaked you out, you should know this is not a gory or excessively violent book. Perhaps sensitive people should avoid it, but it would be a great book for a father to share reading with a son, and then to discuss responsibility in taking action if someone appears to be in trouble, the social boundaries of friendship and relationships, and how seductions into evil behavior are not always so easy to resist or easy to spot. Of course, this depend on what kind of kid you've got, too. Myself, as a child, I read everything I could get my hands on, so I was precocious to a degree and far ahead of my peers AND parents in comprehension and literary pretensions. I've grown out of part of this, can you guess what I still have to a fault?In this book Bradbury's word choices sometimes run away into thick fogs or overgrown gardens, and sometimes he gets lost exploring a sound/word group of descriptions that he tries to use instead of sentences for atmospheric actions or scenes. He's not as good at this as Dr. Seuss, but then this isn't Bradbury's strength. What he is good at is writing muscular speculative stories with vivid characters who face dramatic ethically challenging situations heroically, which can be read by people of all ages.I don't believe I would like carnivals at all. Sound of Thunder was included in my audiobook of Something Wicked. ... Hello, Tyrannosaurus Rex hunt! Cool!"
9628,Long After Midnight,Ray Bradbury,4.04,1927,110,Char,3,"The October Game was my favorite story in Long After Midnight. It's one of those tales where the last line punches you right in the gut. Unfortunately, many of the rest of the stories didn't resonate with me. Perhaps I read this collection too close to The Martian Chronicles? I couldn't help but compare the two and The Chronicles always came out ahead. I'm still happy that I read this collection, as my goal is to read all of Ray Bradbury's work. I guess not all of his stories are going to knock the ball out of the park, but a mediocre Bradbury story is still better than a good one from most other authors. Recommended for fans of science fiction, dark fiction and short stories."
3082,Elizabeth Von Arnim: Eine Biographie,Karen Usborne,3.6,5,1,Suzi,5,"Elizabeth was a fascinating woman. Her early married life is much like the fictional character, ""Rosalind"" in the Elswyth Thane Williamsburg series. [surely Thane knew her, or at least of her] Elizabeth's writings are beautiful, and reading her biography, I am left still wondering where in the depths of her soul she found the worlds she created in fiction. Her life has so many layers and nuances, that I plan to re-read this book after having an opportunity to absorb the first sitting. Usborne's writing style is imminently readable, and well suited to her subject."
1140698,Elizabeth and Her German Garden,Elizabeth von Arnim,3.84,1822,261,Tadiana ✩Night Owl☽,4,"Elizabeth and her German Garden is a semi-autobiographical book written in 1898 by Elizabeth von Arnim (author of The Enchanted April) about her life and garden in the area of Nassenheide, Pomerania, where the family had their estate (her husband was minor nobility).Pomerania is an area in the northeast part of Germany and northwest part of Poland, on the south shores of the Baltic Sea. Random interesting trivia: it's also the home of Malbork Castle, the largest castle in the world:This book is written in a loose diary form and doesn't have any plot to speak of; it's more like hanging out for a year with Elizabeth and her young family: a husband, called Man of Wrath for reasons not really readily apparent from the text, and three young daughters, ages 3-5, nicknamed the April, May and June babies. Visitors--some pleasant, some vastly irritating--come and go, or sometimes come and stay, even when Elizabeth would rather they just left. Frankly, Elizabeth really would rather everyone just left her alone so she could focus on her garden . . . not that Elizabeth really knows all that much about gardening, but she is determined to learn, and she loves being surrounded by flowers.I appreciated Elizabeth's passion for nature. If you're a gardening lover, you'll probably love this. In this book you will be frequently confronted with paragraphs like this one:I wish the years would pass quickly that will bring my garden to perfection! The Persian Yellows have gone into their new quarters, and their place is occupied by the tearose Safrano; all the rose beds hare carpeted with pansies sown in July and transplanted in October, each bed having a separate colour. The purple ones are the most charming and go well with every rose, but I have white ones with Laurette Messimy, and yellow ones with Safrano, and a new red sort in the big centre bed of red roses. . . . If this sort of language brings a thrill to your heart, you really need to read this book. Personally I sort of tolerated this kind of botanical rhapsodizing because (a) the book is so short (not much over 100 pages on my Kindle), and (b) Elizabeth pretty much gives equal time to talking--and sometimes snarking--about her family, visitors, and life in general, and she can be extremely funny.These despicable but irritating [mosquitoes] don't seem to have anything to do but to sit in multitudes on the sand, waiting for any prey Providence may send them; and as soon as the carriage appears they rise up in a cloud, and rush to meet us, almost dragging us out bodily, and never leave us until we drive away again. The sudden view of the sea from the messy, pine-covered height directly above it where we picnic; the wonderful stretch of lonely shore with the forest to the water's edge; the coloured sails in the blue distance; the freshness, the brightness, the vastness—all is lost upon the picnickers, and made worse than indifferent to them, by the perpetual necessity they are under of fighting these horrid creatures. It is nice being the only person who ever goes there or shows it to anybody, but if more people went, perhaps the mosquitoes would be less lean, and hungry, and pleased to see us. It has, however, the advantage of being a suitable place to which to take refractory visitors when they have stayed too long, or left my books out in the garden all night, or otherwise made their presence a burden too grievous to be borne; then one fine hot morning when they are all looking limp, I suddenly propose a picnic on the Baltic. I have never known this proposal fail to be greeted with exclamations of surprise and delight. ""The Baltic! You never told us you were within driving distance? How heavenly to get a breath of sea air on a day like this! The very thought puts new life into one! And how delightful to see the Baltic! Oh, please take us!"" And then I take them.Elizabeth von Arnim liberally sprinkles her stories with German words and phrases that she doesn't bother translating, so I got to play German translator for our group read. Like Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I love to be of use. :) My German translations are in the comment thread to this review, for anyone who might find them helpful, along with our buddy read discussions. ETA: I've also copied these translations at the end of this review, per Hana's suggestion.Elizabeth's husband pops into the story from time to time. Occasionally he goes off into pompous lectures about the frailties and shortcomings of women. He seems to be doing it with tongue in cheek, just to tease his wife or bait the women listening to him, but I did find myself wondering just how much he really meant it, and these parts were irritating to read. So minus a star for those sections and for the parts when the gardening trivialities and minutiae made my eyes glaze over. But overall this is an enjoyable short novel about an unusual, intelligent, literate woman and her dislikes and passions, and a charming glimpse into a time long ago and far away.""I don't love things that will only bear the garden for three or four months in the year and require coaxing and petting for the rest of it. Give me a garden full of strong, healthy creatures, able to stand roughness and cold without dismally giving in and dying.

3088,A Room with a View / Howards End,E.M. Forster,4.08,2248,118,Sharone,5,"Oh, friends. There is only one word to describe my experience reading this book: delightful. But because you know I can't resist the opportunity to say more than one word, I won't stop there.A Room with a View is deeply satirical, and yet the characters manage to be real people rather than one-dimensional conduits for the author's social criticisms. Forster's voice and humor are subtle without being sly, and he draws you into the inner lives of his characters in a way that feels so natural it's hardly noticeable. Forster truly sees his characters, and he makes you feel that you see and instantly comprehend them too, in spite of their complexity. It seemed like every paragraph I read, I wanted to post part or all of it somewhere for others to share and appreciate, but I was afraid that once started, I'd be unable to stop. Even though it's short and sweet, Forster packs in fabulous scenery, murders, scandals and gossip, people getting comeuppances, characters you love and characters you hate, characters that you hate and then love, and vice versa. I warned you I'd gush over this book - I mean really. Every time I read just a little bit of it, I slip right back into that world and I'm tempted to just drop everything and read it again--and it's so short that it could easily be done. Gosh, I could go on and on, using any and all of these words: charming, insightful, effortless, fascinating, hilarious, clever, absorbing. So enjoyable that I just flew right through it. Oh, and romantic. Terribly, meltingly, giddily romantic. So go read it already. Come on, it'll take you five minutes -- at least, it will feel that way. That, to me, makes A Room with a View just the best kind of book. :)"

2844,Tuck Everlasting - Bridge to Terabithia: Curriculum Unit,Natalie Babbitt,4.08,51,5,Austin Makrides,5,"I think Tuck Everlasting is a great book and I am in the middle of reading it and I enjoy it a lot. It was coming from a deep thought of living forever. Which is pretty scary to me. In the book there is this family they live forever. After they found out they couldn't get hurt or die they were pretty amazed and confused. The book has a quote it's pretty straight forward the quote is ""don't fear death, fear the un-lived life."" This is like today everyone thinks about death no one just lives life peacefully, life is gift use it. In the book it teaches you a lesson of living life to the fullest. I would recommend this book for middle school kids and others because it sends a pretty nice message."
2848,Blueberries for the Queen,John  Paterson,3.72,101,22,Eva Leger,3,"I don't know how to rate this. We found this at the library, just looking around, and glancing through it I could see the boys imagination working overtime so I decided it was coming home with us. (Julia has a vivid imagination and we like to read stories which parallel that at times.) Anyway, there is more story than with most simple picture books so that's one plus for us. We still read plenty of simple picture books, don't get me wrong, but we're stepping it up a notch at the same time. My daughter is 5 years old and I kind of think this may work better for maybe 6-8 year olds? I truly loved the fact that this is based on a real event in history - those tend to be some of my favorite kids books and I had no idea that this was so until I reached the end of the book. (Imagine the aweome story someone had to tell others for life!) (No queens ever come to Middletown, Delaware.) :-( Julia was into it, she didn't lose interest and the illustrations are okay, nothing special to me or her. I'd maybe recommend it for boys or girls from a mature 4 to about maybe 8 with very active imaginations. A healthy interest in queens wouldn't hurt either."

2841,Bridge to Terabithia: The Official Movie Companion,David Paterson,3.95,328,45,Cindy,4,"A sweet read. I thought from the movie trailers that it was going to be like Spiderwick or Narnia and for a while was wondering why it wasn't going ""fantasy"" like I thought. Then I realized that the story is about Jess and Leslie, but mostly Jess, and not really about their secret world. It was a good story and although some may argue that the ending is too grown up for children, I would disagree. Kids have hard stuff to go through. I know of several that have had some hard lives at times and I think to know of someone else's troubles can be helpful. We shouldn't live there but a visit can do some good for those that need a little help."
2847,"Bread and Roses, Too",Katherine Paterson,3.74,1848,294,Shomeret,4,"This is a lovely story that deals with the Lawrence Massachusetts mill workers' strike in 1912 that is associated with the song ""Bread and Roses"". I've always found the song very stirring--especially as sung by Judy Collins. I was surprised to find a novel written from the perspective of two children about this event. I found the viewpoints of Jake and Rosa very believable.It's a book that isn't just about the strike. It's about the role of education, ethnic identity and the meaning of family.Some would find the ending sentimental, but I have a broad streak of sentimentality. I was touched by it."
3618,¡Ya Basta!: Ten Years of the Zapatista Uprising,Subcomandante Marcos,4.14,181,7,Rachel Jackson,3,"Subcomandante Insurgente Marcos (or Galeano, as he is known now) always seems to have a surprise up his sleeve when it comes to writing about the Zapatista movement of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN). I read his other selected writings in Our Word Is Our Weapon and loved them, and when I discovered this compilation in my local library I knew I couldn't pass it up. Parts of it were interesting and parts of it were drivel, if I'm being completely honest. It was broad, sweeping coverage of the beliefs and stories behind the EZLN, but as with OWIOW, I felt it was too heavily consisting of stories and legends rather than histories and philosophies of the movement. The more I read and learn about the Zapatistas the more interested in them I become, and I hoped to learn more about the history of the uprising and its planning and where it will go from here. There was a great deal more information about that in this book than there was in any previous writings of Marcos that I've read, but not nearly enough. I want an account of January 1, 1994. I want to know about the preparation of that fateful day; I want to know more about the uprising operations; I want to know more about the immediate aftermath and the people's viewpoints and opinions following that day. Ya Basta! did contain more information on that subject than any other book I've read on it, but it still wasn't close to enough. Marcos is infinitely quotable, that's for sure, and there are plenty of inspiring things in the book to make you think about political movements and especially those that ignite rebellion nation-wide as the Zapatistas have done in Mexico. By far my favorite part of the book was the very end, all of the declarations from the Lacandon Jungle that the EZLN issued over the course of their uprising. There it was so interesting to read the motivations for their military action and planned resistance in the future. Reading about the EZLN always makes me angry about the conditions they have been given by the Mexican government, but it also fills me with hope and inspiration knowing that there can be a future to push for, a world in which all worlds can fit."

9827,"King Rat (Asian Saga, #4)",James Clavell,4.1,27668,680,Agnieszka,4," Changi was set like a pearl on the eastern tip of Singapore Island, iridescent under the bowl of tropical skies. It stood on a slight rise and around it was a belt of green, and farther off the green gave way to the blue-green seas and the seas to infinity of horizon.  This beautiful opening line is like a promise of fantastic adventure, exotic trip, it evokes some delightful place, a mystery island you always dreamt about but it is anything but it. Changi was the inhuman Japanese camp for the war prisoners, for people whom the only sin was that they lost their war and didn't die. I had read some camp stories already but mostly European, and though my knowledge of the war on the Pacific is only basic this one felt very reliable to me. Not only because it is based on facts from Clavell’s life who himself was a prisoner of Changi camp in Singapore and thanks to it the whole story, being still the work of fiction, gained air of realism and credibility; not only because it is a gripping, well paced reading, also because it reads as an excellent study of characters and morality in extreme situations. And is pretty damn well written.The two main characters of the novel are the men representing totally different approach to life: pragmatic and smart, self-made American named the King and Peter Marlowe, somewhat uptight English guy, well-educated and brought up in the family with military traditions. Both in readers and other prisoners the King arouses mixed feelings. Disgust, sympathy, antipathy, open hostility and then again admiration. For his cleverness, business sense and good fortune he’s the object of jealousy and hatred but the King is not a thief. He just has a flair for organizing his life easier and seize any opportunity to gain some money and money will give him the rest. The food, medicaments, cigarettes and something less tangible: sense of power. Though set in particular time and place it's a fictional account but I think Clavell did fine work here not only showing animosities between ordinary soldiers and officers, confrontation between the King and other prisoners, especially rivetingly is shown conflict with provost marshall Grey, but also indicating different attitudes and class differences of three main national groups of prisoners: British, Australians and Americans. King Rat is a clash of personalities, a display of cynicism, lack of scruples and ability to adjust to any situation in the camp. But also an extraordinary courage, solidarity and commitment. It's about a price you are willing to pay to survive and principles you could sacrifice to make it. There is no easy explicitness here, no distinct line between that what you can accept and not feel irretrievably corrupted. It teaches you that to outlast the camp, like on the outside in fact, you need to be a part at least a small group, that the camp is not a place for a lone wolf. But it’s also about a fear what life would be alike after Changi since no one escaped the camp unchanged, that place made them, then reshaped and destroyed, and how one can forget about atrocities prisoners were subjected to. King Rat  has a whole bunch finely drawn figures but it’s the King and Marlowe that have our interest. I liked the dynamics between them, the way their relationship developed, what they went through and lessons they learnt from themselves. And though I’d like to see them leaving Changi and arm in arm going towards setting sun I somewhat felt the ending, sad as it was, to be more true.And if someone prefers more concise review, please, here it is. Of rats and men."
8514,Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: An American Controversy,Annette Gordon-Reed,3.92,309,45,Elena,5,"The Hemingses of Monticello by Annette Gordon-Reed is an historical epic about Thomas Jefferson and the enslaved family who served him. Anyone who has ever done research based on the letters, memoirs and records of a family will know how difficult it can be to piece the information into a coherent narrative. For this reason, Dr. Gordon-Reed's work is truly awe-inspiring, in that she pulls together scraps of information about the Hemingses from the writings by and about the Jeffersons in order to craft a moving and insightful chronicle of slave life in America. Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of Independence and our third President, was quite outspoken about the rights of the man, rejoicing in the French Revolution and the overthrow of monarchy. Jefferson, however, excerized more power over his slaves than did any absolute monarch over their subjects. Jefferson chose to govern his slaves with a certain benevolent paternalism, letting the Hemings brothers James and Robert come and go pretty much as they pleased as long as they came when he called. Neverthless, the fact that his entire existence was entwined with an unjust institution from which he never sought to extricate himself is one of the great ironies of American history.The book delves into the origins of slavery in Virginia, and how the ""peculiar institution"" became deeply engrained in the culture of that time and place, not going away when free Virginians won their independence from Great Britain. Dr. Gordon-Reed relates how John Wayles, Jefferson's father-in-law, made his fortune as a lawyer who oversaw the buying and selling of slaves. Through his wife Martha Wayles, Jefferson inherited the Hemings family, many of whom were the children of John Wayles and his slave mistress, Elizabeth Hemings. Therefore, many of the enslaved servants of the Jefferson family were close relatives. When Jefferson made the teenage Sally Hemings his mistress, after Martha died, the situation became even more complicated. Even if Sally had not been enslaved, Jefferson could not have married her because under Virginia law it was illegal to marry the sibling of one's spouse. Jefferson kept a promise which he had made to Sally in Paris, where their liaison began, that he would free each of her children when they came of age, and it was a promise he kept. Most of the other Hemings and the Jefferson family slaves remained in slavery and were sold at auction after Jefferson's death to cover his enormous debts.One aspect of the book which I found distracting was the author's propensity to remind the reader every few pages that various injustices were the result of the ""doctrine of white supremacy."" With such impeccable research presented in a flowing and compelling manner, it was unnecessary to be constantly preaching to the reader about the evils of such a ""doctrine."" It would have been better to let the injustices speak for themselves. Furthermore, there were others besides enslaved Africans who suffered from exploitation in the early days of our country, including white indentured servants, although they, unlike the African slaves, could at least look forward to freedom. In the cemetery of the parish church in Maryland where I went as a child there is a mass grave of Irish workers who died of cholera while constructing the C&O Canal and B&O Railroad during the epidemics of 1822 and 1832. The Irish immigrants rather than the African slaves were sent to do certain dangerous jobs because the slaves cost money and the Irish cost nothing. This form of servitude still does not compare to chattel slavery, since the Irish could not (usually) be sold.The power of Dr. Gordon-Reed's book lies in exposing once again the sad and tragic fact that many white Americans were convinced that Africans were subhuman. Examples are given in the book of Jefferson's conviction that Africans were biologically inferior to whites. That those who framed our system of government had such an approach to other human beings is a jarring commentary. It has always been a mystery how leaders like Thomas Jefferson could cry so loud for liberty and then live off the labor of those in chattel bondage. After reading The Hemingses of Monticello my understanding of the enigmatic Jefferson has been expanded as well as my compassion for those whom he held as slaves."

9784,"Women in Love (Brangwen Family, #2)",D.H. Lawrence,3.66,25206,849,Cecily,4,"*I can review this only in relation to its precursor, The Rainbow (review here). My JourneyI went straight from the flames of floral, rural passion in The Rainbow, to this often brittle discussion of the abstract, set in a more mechanical age, where animals - metaphorical and literal - are key, and death’s shadow hovers hungrily. It's beautiful, entrancing, but also opaque and frustrating.I travelled with Ursula from her teenage years in the balmy countryside, where people act on their desires, to her earnest twenties: first in a grimy northern mining town, then in the frigid, glistening ice of the Tyrollean Alps. It’s not such a linear narrative as The Rainbow; more a series of episodes (chapter lengths vary hugely - between 3 and 50 pages).It seems to ask:•	Must the rainbow hues leach out of life (Gudrun’s ever-colourful stocking notwithstanding)?•	Must passion end in death (not necessarily the little one)?This is a novel of ideas, but I often felt unequal to them. There was so much to wrestle with, I was stripped bare by the dizzying mix of themes, language, passions, lives - and deaths. I had to submit to the experience, though in a rather different way to The Rainbow.My status on finishing was a single word, “Eviscerated”. Ruminating further, a conversation towards the end is pertinent. One character tells their partner “It’s over”, and the reply is “But it isn’t finished… There must be finality”. In writing this, I think I have found finality. (I will return to Lawrence, though!)Lawrence wrote this after Wilde, during a war (WW1), and before Waugh. It has the self-consciously clever dialogue of the first and last, in the context of warring relationships: all conflicted between love and hate, artifice and instinct, life and death - murderous desire, even.The intellectual sparring matches have a theatrical quality, as if the protagonists are speaking for posterity. Then the audience departs, the mask falls, and naturalistic passion, action and imagery blossoms, such as the blissful release for Birkin, rolling naked in the primroses. “He wanted to touch them all… to saturate himself with the touch of them all… It was such a fine, cool, subtle touch all over him, he seemed to saturate himself with their contact.” The rarer physical assaults (lapis, wrestling, and in the snow) have greater visceral power as a result.It seems to say that whatever persona we try to present, however much we try to assert our will (a recurring theme), we’re all animals underneath. AnimalsWhat a carnal carnival of animals this is. People are likened to, amongst other things: smiling wolf, hermit crab, pouncing hound, octopus, restless bird, “slithering sea-lion”, “funeral bird, feeding on the miseries of the people”, small cat, dog, cockerel, bird of paradise, rabbit, wild animal, shrew, stallion, “hopping flea”, fish, weasel, voice like a gull, water-spiders, horses, python, “eyes as keen as a hawk”, water-rat, “elegant beetle”, seal, “eyes blazed like a tiger’s”, bat, amphibious beast, eagle, “humble maggot”, wearing “startling colours, like a macaw”, eels, various insects, and “strange moths”!Gudrun’s art typically features animals and birds, her friendship with Loerke is kindled by a picture of his statue of a naked girl on a horse, and there are actual animals at key points in the story: •	Ursula and Gudrun watch Gerald violently beat his horse to submission, when it is terrified by a train.•	Gudrun confronts an alarming herd of cattle, but finds inner strength (and euythmics).•	A chapter is devoted to Birkin’s cat - given to him by Hermione, and still part of the power she wields over him.•	Another chapter is about a vicious pet rabbit (called Bismarck) that draws blood from Gerald and Gudrun.PlotThere are four main characters: Ursula Brangwen and her sister Gudrun, only a year younger. They are very close, but it’s also fiery relationship. Both teach at the grammar school: Ursula as a general teacher and Gudrun just art (she is really a sculptor, has travelled abroad, and lived in Bohemian London). They become involved with Rupert Birkin, a school inspector, and Gerald Crich, eldest son of a wealthy colliery owner. Birkin and Gerald have a deep and conflicted relationship with each other. Women in Love - or Men in Love? The Crich family is large, the mother mentally unstable, and the father physically declining. We know nothing of Birkin’s family. The four go to Innsbruck, where Loerke, a German artist, is added to the increasingly toxic mix of relationships.Ursula and Gudrun are fiercely independent women, in thought and deed, including their relationships. They are not afraid of what other people think. The problem is that that often can’t decide what they think and so cannot decide what they should do and not do: “His licentiousness was repulsively attractive” and “she was far, far from being at ease with him”. And yet…The men’s attitudes to women are not as positive or equal. At times, they’re exploitative, at other times, women are considered second best, albeit decorative and convenient. Towards the end, I feared Lawrence was going to quash all that and have them either settle for conventionality, or suffer for not doing so... Recurring ThemesIs it better to look at things as a whole, or take them to pieces? “I really don’t want to be forced into all this criticism and analysis of life. I really do want to see things in their entirety, with their beauty left in them.” In this review, I've opted for the former.It is set in age of change: mechanisation, social mobility, equality, and philanthropy. To the father, “in Christ, he was one with his workmen”, but to his son, they “were his instruments” and “What mattered was the great social productive machine.”Primarily though, this is about relationships:The types of love, relationships, and marriage considered and entered into is very broad-minded for the time, such as “a mutual union in separateness”. It also explores how/if sex and friendship relate. “She had had lovers, she had known passion. But this was neither love nor passion. It was the daughters of men coming back to the sons of God, the strange inhuman sons of God.”Homosexuality, bisexuality, and non-monogamous relationships suffuse the story. It’s not just the famous naked wrestling: is far less ambiguous than I expected. “I believe in the additional perfect relationship between a man and a man.” Later, ""You are enough for me, as far as a woman is concerned. You are all women to me. But I wanted a man friend, as eternal as you and I are eternal... to make it complete, really happy, I wanted eternal union with a man too: another kind of love.""Conflict and duality are present in all the main relationships (love, hate, and whose will will triumph), violence and coercion too. “Always it was this eternal see-saw, one destroyed that the other might exist, one ratified because the other was nulled.” Ultimately, “One of them must triumph over the other”.There is no escape, “It was a fight to the death between them - or to new life: though in what the conflict lay, no one could say” and ""She felt an approaching release, a new fountain of life rising up in her... Yet underneath was death itself."" Quotes•	“A strange enmity… very near to love.”•	“I hate subtleties. I always think they are a sign of weakness.”•	“The lake lay all grey and visionary, stretching into the moist, translucent vista of trees and meadow.”•	“It was rather delicious to feel her drawing his self-revelation from him… And her dark eyes seemed to be looking through into his naked organism… She wanted the secret of him, the experience of his male being.”•	“She seemed to become soft, subtly to infuse herself into his bones, as if she were passing into him in a black, electric flow. Her being suffused into his veins like a magnetic darkness.”•	“They always kept a gap, a distance between them, they wanted always to be free of each other. Yet there was a curious heart-straining towards each other.”•	“She seemed to grip the hours by the throat, to force her life from them.”•	“It was a sunny, soft morning in early summer, when life ran in the world subtly like a reminiscence.”•	“The heavy gold glamour of approaching sunset lay over all the colliery district, and the ugliness overlaid with beauty was like a narcotic to the senses… over all the amorphous squalor a kind of magic was cast.”•	“The broad dialect was curiously caressing to the blood… In their voices she could hear the voluptuous resonance of darkness, the strong, dangerous underworld, mindless, inhuman. They sounded also like strange machines heavily oiled.”•	“Why should you always be doing?” Often, I wanted the characters to do more doing (and less talking).•	“He saw her face strangely enkindled, as if suffused from within by a powerful sweet fire. His soul was arrested in wonder. She was enkindled in her own living fire. Arrested in wonder and in pure, perfect attraction, he moved towards her.”•	“On the water, lanterns were coming alight, faint ghosts of warm flame floating in the pallor of the first twilight. The earth was spread with darkness, like lacquer, overhead was a pale sky, all primrose, and the lake was pale as milk in one part. Away at the landing stage, tiniest points of coloured rays were stringing themselves in the dusk... All round, shadow was gathering from the trees.”•	Pain “gradually absorbed hi life. Gradually it drew away all his potentiality, it bled him into the dark, it weaned him of life.”•	“The men were satisfied to belong to the great and wonderful machine, even whilst it destroyed them...Their hearts died within them, but their souls were satisfied.”•	“I want you to drop your assertive will… I want you to trust yourself so implicitly, that you can let yourself go.”•	“He kissed her softly… like dew falling.”•	“Her father was not a coherent human being, he was a roomful of old echoes.”•	Wrestling, “They became accustomed to each other, to each other's rhythm, they got a kind of mutual physical understanding...as if they would break into a oneness… working into a tighter closer oneness of struggle, with a strange, octopus-like knotting and flashing of limbs in the subdued light of the room… the strange sound of flesh escaping under flesh. Often, in the white interlaced knot of violent living being that swayed silently, there was no head to be seen, only the swift, tight limbs, the solid white backs, the physical junction of two bodies clinched into oneness… The earth seemed to tilt and sway, and a complete darkness was coming over his mind. He did not know what happened.” •	“The talk went on like a rattle of small artillery... the continual splatter of verbal jest, designed to give a tone of flippancy to a stream of conversation that was all critical and general, a canal of conversation rather than a stream. The attitude was mental and very wearying.”•	H's face: “There was something of the stupidity and the unenlightened self-esteem of a horse in it.”•	“Her pity for him was as cold as stone, its deepest motive was hate of him, and fear of his power over her, which she must always counterfoil.”•	“She was like a flower just opened in the rain, the heart of the blossom just newly visible, seeming to emit a warmth of retained sunshine.”•	“And now, behold, from the smitten rock of the man's body, from the strange marvellous flanks and thighs, deeper, further in mystery than the phallic source, came the floods of ineffable darkness and ineffable riches.”•	“She had her desire of him, she touched, she received the maximum of unspeakable communication in touch, dark, subtle, positively silent, a magnificent gift and give again, a perfect acceptance and yielding, a mystery... the immemorial magnificence of mystic, palpable, real otherness.”•	“He seemed to be gathering her into himself, her warmth, her softness, her adorable weight, drinking in the suffusion of her physical being, avidly. He lifted her, and seemed to pour her into himself, like wine into a cup… So she relaxed, and seemed to melt, to flow into him, as if she were some infinitely warm and precious suffusion filling into his veins, like an intoxicant.•	“She reached up, like Eve reaching to the apples on the tree of knowledge… touching his face with her infinitely delicate, encroaching wondering fingers… Her soul thrilled with complete knowledge. This was the glistening, forbidden apple, this face of a man.”•	“To know him, to gather him in by touch... She wanted to touch him and touch him and touch him.”•	“It was a rather stiff, sad meeting, more like a verification of separateness than a reunion.”•	“There they sat down, folded together, folded round with the same rug, creeping in nearer and ever nearer to one another, till it seemed they had crept right into each other, and become one substance.”•	“His heart went up like a flame of ice.”•	They “found themselves in a vague, unsubstantial outdoors of dim snow and ghosts of an upper-world, that made strange shadows before the stars... It seemed conscious, malevolent, purposive in its intense murderous coldness.”•	“The first days passed in an ecstasy of physical motion, sleighing, skiing, skating, moving in an intensity of speed and white light that surpassed life itself, and carried the souls of the human beings beyond into an inhuman abstraction of velocity and weight and eternal, frozen snow.”•	“It was a fight to the death, she knew it now.”•	“Either the heart would break, or cease to care.”MoonyOne of my favourite passages, from the chapter titled ""Moony"":Throwing stones at the moon’s reflection: “Darts of bright light shot asunder, darkness swept over the centre. There was no moon, only a battlefield of broken lights and shadows, running close together. Shadows, dark and heavy, struck again and again across the place where the heart of the moon had been, obliterating it altogether. The white fragments pulsed up and down, and could not find where to go, apart and brilliant on the water like the petals of a rose that a wind has blown far and wide… He saw the moon regathering itself insidiously, saw the heart of the rose intertwining vigorously and blindly, calling back the scattered fragments, winning home the fragments, in a pulse and in effort of return.” Throw another stone: “Flakes of light appeared here and there, glittering tormented among the shadows, far off, in strange places; among the dripping shadow of the willow on the island.”Amusing Bafflement•	Chapter VI has three references to “inchoate eyes”, whatever that means.•	“He rocked on the water perfectly, like the rocking of phosphorescence.” Yes, he’s in a boat, but even so…•	“Her soul was destroyed with the exquisite shock of his invisible fluid lightning… Ah much, much, many days harvesting for her large, yet perfectly subtle and intelligent hands upon the field of his living, radio-active body.” Ugh - or LOL?*Picture sourcesCarpet of primroses: https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/...Brinsley colliery: http://www.healeyhero.co.uk/rescue/ea...Alpine peak: http://il1.picdn.net/shutterstock/vid..."
3896,"Betty Crocker's Picture Cookbook, Facsimile Edition",Betty Crocker,4.35,2490,64,Edgar,5,"I've been trying to make gluten free cakes and have had little success until recently when we came across these really old recipes online that seemed to work well with rice flour. The recipes were from the old Betty Crocker's 1950 edition cookbook before they changed all of the recipes to make them ""healthy."" I would suggest to anyone that likes to really cook to get this reproduction of the 1950 edition of the Betty Crocker's cookbook. Have you ever wondered why the current recipes in the newest edition don't taste anywhere near as good as the ones in the boxes at the store? It is likely a marketing ploy. Betty Crocker and other companies likely make more money off people buying their boxed cakes than off their recipe books. I would suggest going back to making the original cakes and recipes they taste like cake. Also if you like cooking from scratch instead of from canned food and are tired of using the microwave, then this cookbook is for you."
9782,The Life of D.H. Lawrence: An Illustrated Biography,Keith M. Sagar,3.43,7,1,Liliana,3,"A fun, illustrated biography of D.H. Lawrence. The text left a lot to be desired, but the original quotes by D.H. Lawrence and people close to him, plus many photos made up for it. Good book to loan from the library. Made me want to check out his book of paintings, which were amazingly tender, sensual, warm, and modern, even though he didn't have any training in painting and started rather late. An amazing life cut way too short...44!!! He really was ahead of his time, and didn't live to see the amazing success and longevity of is works."
5882,"The Sword of Cortés (Pirates of the Caribbean: Jack Sparrow, #4)",Rob Kidd,3.97,605,15,Michael Gerald,1,"I found this book at a Booksale branch and, since I liked the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movie series, bought it. (It was also cheap). But...The plot is so fast and flimsy, with not enough development of character. I know this is the fourth of a series, but it would have helped those who haven't read the others to know more about the characters and the circumstances. Maybe it's because it's a book written for children.And a major factual error: Cortes was no saint, but the Aztec civilization was not a model for good behavior either. The Aztecs waged wars in order to expand their territory and capture prisoners for their blood-soaked ritual sacrifices. It was just their misfortune that they found in Cortes and the conquistadors a more violent opponent with better weapons."

Gioco di specchi potrebbe stargli meglio: e probabilmente romanzo accademico anche di più.Ma suppongo che Coetzee, come la maggior parte degli artisti, preferirebbe non essere etichettato, circoscritto, catalogato.Ha poca importanza l’argomento, la vita degli animali, i loro diritti, il nostro rapprocciarci a loro, capirli o meno, sentirlo o meno, condividerli o meno, la sofferenza che noi animali umani infliggiamo agli animali non umani. Ha di certo poca importanza per me che avrei goduto leggendo un libro così anche se avesse discusso del sesso degli angeli, di lana caprina, del peso dell’anima, dell’angoscia del portiere prima del calcio di rigore o della perplessità degli artisti sotto la tenda del circo.Conosco la personale opinione di Coetzee sul tema in questione, eppure è così abile a destreggiarsi che riesce a enunciarla senza sbilanciarsi, senza favoritismi, lasciando che venga contraddetta con argomenti altrettanto credibili e solidi, al punto che si può perfino dubitare sul suo pensiero e sentimento autentico.Le varie posizioni sono esposte da personaggi che sono tutti accademici, docenti universitari e ricercatori, i quali danno la garanzia di essere ben documentati: etologia, ecologia, poesia, filosofia, religione… Al punto che alla fine possiamo chiederci se Coetzee abbia davvero parlato degli animali e non invece ‘solo’ del valore della letteratura."

As a self-appointed Captain Jack Sparrow expert and enthusiast, I'm rather picky about folks getting him right. Rob Kidd does an admirable job here, capturing Captain Jack's voice and mannerisms so well that I actually pictured a 21 Jump Street-era Johnny Depp acting them out. The book is very clearly part of a series, and while it could stand alone, there's no reason you'd want it to. It has its own arc and ties in with a larger storyline as well. The book ""sets up"" familiar characters from the movies, including both Tia Dalma and Davy Jones. Jack's desire early on seems to be to rid the world of pirates, or so he tells his crew, and I'm interested to see if the other books explain his apparent distaste for his future profession."

Our actions (both good and evil) come from what lies in our heart. How do we change our heart?

One of the obvious problems is that he lived a long time ago, and many of the cultural referents have changed. You're constantly having to think ""Well, nowadays what he's saying would correspond to THAT"".

It's notorious that readers most often give up somewhere in the third book. I started wondering if there was any modern-day author one could identify with Dante, and if that might help us connect to his concerns. And in fact, I do have a suggestion that some people will no doubt condemn out of hand as completely heretical: Richard Dawkins. Now of course, I am aware that Dante was deeply immersed in the Christian world-view, and Dawkins is famous for being the world's most outspoken atheist. But it's not quite as crazy as it first may seem. Dante was a Christian to the core of his being, but he was furious with the way the Church was being run; he put several of its leaders, notably Pope Boniface VIII, in Hell. On the other side, I challenge anyone to read ""The Ancestor's Tale"" to the end, and not, at least for a moment, entertain the idea that Dawkins is in actual fact a deeply religious man. He admits as much himself: as he puts it, it's often not so much that he disagrees with conventionally religious people, more that ""they are saying it wrong"". Amen to that.As noted, both Dante and Dawkins are extremely unhappy with the way mainstream religion is being organized. The other characteristic that unites them for me is this passionate love for science. One has to remember that, for Dante, Ptolomaic astronomy was state of the art stuff, and the details of the angelic hierarchy were a topic of vital importance; of course he cross-examines the hosts of the blessed to find out more. These days, I imagine he would be trying to get inside information on what happened during the Big Bang before spontaneous symmetry breaking occurred, whether or not the Higgs particle really exists, and how evolution produced human intelligence. For Dante, there didn't seem to be any opposition between religious faith and science - they were part of the same thing. I do wonder what he would have thought if he had been able to learn that many leading religious figures, even in the early 21st century, reject a large part of science as being somehow unreligious. It's wrong to spend your life dispassionately trying to understand God's Universe? I can see him getting quite angry about this, and deciding to rearrange the seating a little down in Hell.I keep thinking that there's a book someone ought to write called ""Five Atheists You'll Meet in Heaven"".

Obviously we wouldn't have the old geocentric model of the Universe - it would be bang up to date.

For example, when we get to the Heaven of the Galaxy, I imagine him using this wonderful fact that all the heavy elements are made in supernova explosions. ""We are all stardust"", as some people like to put it. Then when we get to the Heaven of the Cosmos, we find that the light from the ""Let there be light"" moment at the beginning of Creation is still around - it's just cooled to 2.7 degrees K, and appears as the cosmic background radiation. But it's not completely uniform, as the quantum fluctuations left over from the period when the Universe was the size of an atomic nucleus are the beginnings of the galaxies created on the second day. Finally, we reach the Heaven of the Multiverse, and find that we are just one of many different universes. It was necessary to create all of them, so that random processes could make sure that a very small number would end up being able to support life. How impious to assume that God would only be able to create one Universe, and have to tweak all the constants Himself!"

5574,"Empty Cradle, Broken Heart: Surviving the Death of Your Baby",Deborah L. Davis,4.21,294,56,Margaret Houston,5,"This is the first book I read since my son died that really got it.A few small bits are somewhat dated - for example, there are now online support groups and forums that weren't around in the early 90's, and, thankfully, people are more aware of the real losses that occur in miscarriage, stillbirth, and infant death, and so are more sensitive. Doctors, family members, etc., are less likely these days to dismiss the loss, and hospitals are better at giving parents choices on whether to hold their child, dress them, etc. These aren't criticisms so much as a plea for an updated version, because the book is wonderfully helpful and healing.The book is realistic and accessible. It doesn't tell you that you can heal quickly, or provide you with a set of one-size-fits-all steps. It doesn't give false promises. The author has worked extensively with bereaved parents, and quotes from interviews are included in each chapter without commentary. Each chapter also includes a helpful ""points to remember"" list at the end.The book addresses the topic with breadth - everything from physical healing, ways to affirm your baby's existence, support networks, dealing with how the loss affects your extended family, the emotions involved in being pregnant and parenting after a loss, and more. I will be passing this book on to my baby's grandparents, since they may also find it helpful, and coming back to it as I continue finding my way through the grief process. This isn't just a one-time read - it's a handbook, a lifeline, and a source of reassurance that you are NOT crazy, you are NOT stuck, you are NOT lost, and you CAN, with time and effort, heal the wound without forgetting or dismissing your baby."
5575,Cradle and All,James Patterson,3.87,27531,879,Lola  Reviewer,3,"Well that was a cruel, devilish ending. Pun oh so intended.I needed to read a James Patterson book, and I finally did. I can’t say I chose right as my first read by him – maybe I should have started with ''Maximum Ride'' – but one can certainly admit that he takes the reader to unexpected, uncharted places.How could I have resisted the premise? Two girls, both pregnant, yet both virgin, also. The son of God is growing inside one, and the son of Lucifer inside the other. But who is the lucky one?I find it peculiar that this book is categorized as a YA novel. Sure, two of the main characters are teenagers, but the rest are adults – family members, a detective, popes and other religious people – and it’s not as if it explores teen-related themes, like first love*, first time, first kiss, first heartbreak, etc. Not really, anyway.So I’m torn over whether it’s for adults or teenagers. For now, I’m just going to say it’s for mature readers, as the themes – religion, sex, belief – are pretty heavy. It’s not a humorous story, unlike I first expected. Look at that cover and title and blurb. Come on, who really thinks this will be serious all the way?But it is. Which is not a problem, but it did take me by surprise. James Patterson’s writing style functions well with this type of story – a mystery – but it isn’t lyrical at all. Ever. It does feel a bit dry, if I dare say so, but the story was interesting enough for me not to care about that too much. This isn’t the kind of book that will make you connect to the characters on an intense level, but you will still feel compassion for them and care for their futures. Anne, the only character who had a first person point of view, was my favourite, which is not surprising since it’s easier to warm up to a character who gives us complete access to their thoughts than to one who shares the bare minimum.I’m curious about James Patterson’s many other novels and series. This will certainly not be my last book by him. * Yes, but the character in question is an adult.Blog | Youtube | Twitter | Instagram | Google+ | Bloglovin’"
4284,Nature Heals: Natura sanat non medicus: Psychological Essays,Paul Goodman,3.8,5,3,Jeff,5,"Here is how Goodreads is introjecting Paul Goodman: Paul Goodman (9/9/11–8/2/72) was an American sociologist, poet, writer, anarchist, public intellectual & gay-rights activist.Note that almost every part of this is wrong; parts of it are, in fact, inaccurate. Yes, Goodman was a public intellectual, and a poet. Trained at the University of Chicago in Aristotle and literary criticism, his sociology was strictly amateur. Why a poet should need a separate designation as a ""writer"" is anyone's guess. Goodman was an anarchist, though his anarchism was of a sexual kind that in our period would get described the way the Rolling Stones were in his -- ""those Charming Deviationists!"" I defy any Paul Goodman scholar to show me how Goodman's social behavior fit within what is described as a ""gay-rights,"" or post-Stonewall activism. In short, the above biography lacks a quality Goodman highly values in this volume: ""contact."" This book came out five years after Goodman's death. Goodman's publication record was spotty: he published a lot, but only in the last twelve years of his life was it with a major publisher -- much of his book-publication before Growing Up Absurd (1960) was with small publishers. Yet periodical publication was a constant of his life, and much of it remained uncollected at his death. His literary executor, (the Hawthorne scholar-poet) Taylor Stoehr, collected his published psychological essays, on Freud, on Reich, on racism, on ""being queer"" (Goodman was a straight white male but with a penchant for black young men), and on writing, in Nature Heals, the title a credo borrowed from the hero of Goodman's novel, Empire City. There are finds: the first essay, ""The Father of the Psychoanalytic Movement,"" is a stunning hybrid-type essay, with Goodman reading, parabolically, six years after Freud's death, as Adam Phillips will, later, the life psychoanalytically. In ""Eros, or the Drawing of the Bow,"" Goodman translates a poem from a follower of Anacreon, that retells the tale from the point of view of one smitten by Eros' wet bow. The passage seems related, for Goodman, to Odyssey xxi. The whole thing seems a highly coded parable on penis envy and homosexuality.A third essay, ""The Political Meaning of Some Recent Revisions of Freud,"" from 1945, places Goodman as central to the cultural left in the pastoral period of anarchism after the War. I know this judgment will disappoint those who, cowed by the critique of it laid on by that most corrupt of thinkers, George Orwell, in his ""Politics and the English Language,"" used Goodman to piss on scholarly efforts to summarize a point of view before attacking it; a scruple to which Orwell himself, as he readily admits, will not stoop. Goodman writes about Reich here in the context of a consensus ""revision"" of Freud reflected in Karen Horney and Erich Fromm. In the section Orwell quotes, Goodman summarizes especially Fromm. As Orwell remarks, if you read the essay it would make sense, but why should that matter to Orwell? Exactly. Goodman's essay, meantime, identifies the Freudian countercultural seam the Left Freudians, like Reich, ""carry into social action"" through their readings of Freud. The consensus psychoanalysts like Horney and Fromm misrepresent ""the original instinct theory,"" by failing to perceive ""the beautiful intuitive centrality among the sciences"" in which Freud places the organism. ""The energy of anxiety is the energy of repressed sexuality"" (italics in the original), an early position of Freud's he later revised, such that children build a ""character armor"" around their sexuality. The insight is on behalf of Fleiss' premise of universal bi-sexuality."
4442,The Road Less Traveled and Beyond: Spiritual Growth in an Age of Anxiety,M. Scott Peck,4.13,3118,89,Matthew D,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I feel like it was one of the best books in terms of usefulness and ability to enlighten. I think the book can be summed up by the idea if we want to be a productive member of society we have to open ourselves to the pain of living, to overcome the pain we must discipline ourselves, we also cannot be loving without this discipline. Key Quotes:“Life is difficult. This is a great truth, one of the greatest truths. It is a great truth because once we truly see this truth, we transcend it. Once we truly know that life is difficult-once we truly understand and accept it-then life is no longer difficult. Because once it is accepted, the fact that life is difficult no longer matters.” “Love is the will to extend one's self for the purpose of nurturing one's own or another's spiritual growth... Love is as love does. Love is an act of will -- namely, both an intention and an action. Will also implies choice. We do not have to love. We choose to love.” “Until you value yourself, you won't value your time. Until you value your time, you will not do anything with it. ” "
4281,Der Medicus. Sonderausgabe.,Noah Gordon,4.35,26491,1399,"Jeanette  ""Astute Crabbist""",5,"This is one of the most satisfying novels I've read in a long time. One of my rare six-star selections. There's a consistency of quality from cover to cover, owing to the perfect marriage of fine writing and graceful editing. Rob J. Cole is a man who feels called to be a healer. He stays true to that calling, even when surrounded by other physicians who are motivated by greed and glory. He risks and sacrifices all for the chance to study in Persia with Ibn Sina, the greatest physician of the 11th century. The story is especially fulfilling because it comes full circle. Rob returns to London after many years in foreign lands. Through comparison with those who have never left home, he realizes how he has grown in compassion, tolerance, and critical thinking. He's so far ahead of the doctors around him that he doesn't fit in, but he does finally find a place where he can put down roots and be surrounded by a loving family and community. This is a sweet relief for him after having been an orphan and an outsider since the age of nine. I read the final paragraph of the book three times in a row with tears in my eyes. There are no spoilers in it, so here is that paragraph: ""As the seasons slipped by, only one thing was constant. The extra sense, the healer's sensitivity, never abandoned him. Whether he was called lonely in the night to a bedside or hurried of a morning into the crowded dispensary, he could always feel their pain. Hastening to struggle with it, he never failed to know--as he had known from the first day in the maristan--a rush of wondering gratitude that he was chosen, that it was he whom God's hand had reached out and touched, and that such an opportunity to minister and serve should have been given to Barber's boy."" That sense of duty, of being one chosen to ease suffering, has completely disappeared from the practice of modern medicine. That is a tragedy beyond reckoning."

Downie does a decent job at bringing her world to life, but the plot and various plot threads are fairly predictable.Inevitably, I've also got to compare Medicus to Lindsay Davis's very fun and entertaining Falco series, also a detective series set in ancient Rome. I do feel that Downie has a better feel for writing from the male perspective, but Davis's Rome is more finely wrought, her plots better developed. Both series have a nice element of humor, although readers who prefer to smile rather than laugh out loud with their mysteries might be more comfortable with Downie's more character-driven style."

4285,Middlesex,Jeffrey Eugenides,3.98,511977,21023,Trina,5,"I got off the bus from Bumbershoot around 1 AM, exhausted. Convinced that even the cars speeding past my window couldn’t keep me from this night’s rest, I opened the door to a stench of exceptional vileness. Not a dead stench, or a spoiled food stench. This was the stench of sewage. From a spot in the center of the living room I surveyed the apartment and discovered the source: the commode and the area around it were covered in yuck. I dialed up the landlord. The exchange went something like this: “There’s shit on my floor.” Why mince words?“What do you want me to do about it?” “I want you to fix my toilet, so there won’t be shit on my floor.”“Have you tried a plunger?” “What do you think?” “And that didn’t work?” After 20 minutes of this verbal badminton, I realized the man wasn’t going to get out of bed without a signed act of congress. He told me there was an all night Denny’s down the street should I need a toilet during the night. So it was that at 2 AM, after multiple rounds of cleaning and yakking, I found myself seated in the kitchen on a kibble-filled bucket, a can of beer in one hand and Middlesex in the other.“There was a place halfway between consciousness and unconsciousness where Tessie did her best thinking.”I’d had two weeks to kill awaiting the arrival of all my worldly possessions. Plenty of time to determine that the kibble bucket was ergonomically preferable to the floor or my sleeping bag. With my front door situated not five feet from a four-lane road and one block from a strip bar whose patrons seemed to enjoy loitering in front of my building, the noise was like steel wool on my nerves, which were already shot from a marathon cross country drive with three cats, a dog, and a friend who was hitching a ride to her father’s funeral in St. Louis all crammed into my car. With no job, no friends, no furniture and now, apparently, no plumbing, this move was beginning to look like a profound error in judgment. The story of a 5-Alpha-Reductase Pseudohermaphrodite proved a likely escape.	“When you travel like I did, vague about destination and with an open-ended itinerary, a holy-seeming openness takes over your character.”I’d only brought one book on my trip west. Considerable thought went into the choice—it had to be an author with a proven ability to hold my interest. It had to be long enough to cover the duration of the journey. And it would need to stand up to multiple readings in the event of the delay of the moving truck or my inability to obtain a library card. As a creative writing major, I’d read The Virgin Suicides and marveled at the rotating first person narrative, the subtlety of the prose, and the fine edge between humor and poignance. Middlesex seemed a safe bet.The book was my constant companion. After a day of fruitless job interviews, I could go home to Callie Stephanides and her family, safe in the knowledge that there were over 200 pages to go before I’d need to find a new distraction. But the new distraction had already found me. I hadn’t written anything longer than a grocery list in 8 years. With all the time in the world and a good book as your muse, aspirations can get pretty lofty.	“Even back then, the Great Books were working on me, silently urging me to pursue the most futile human dream of all, the dream of writing a book worthy of joining their number…”I won’t say that Middlesex turned me into a writer or anything lofty like that. The first time I saw Singin’ in the Rain, I nearly concussed myself trying run up a wall. When I reached the last word, I closed the book. Waited five minutes. Began again:“I was born twice: first, as a baby girl, on a remarkably smogless Detroit day in January of 1960; and then again, as a teenage boy, in an emergency room near Petoskey, Michigan, in August of 1974.”"

7720,Metamorphosis and Identity,Caroline Walker Bynum,4.22,41,6,Ruth Feiertag,3,"I read Caroline Walker Bynum's *Metamorphosis and Identity* as part of my research for a paper I'm about to give on identity in the medieval poem *Sir Orfeo*, so I read it with double perspective: first, for its usefulness for my research (yes, I'm willing to use a book and then just set it aside), and second, for its enjoyability. *M&I* was a joy on both counts. Bynum's discussions of identity and werewolves (*Buffy the Vampire Slayer* even gets a mention) provided me with new insights and approaches to take regarding my topic and even gave me the inspiration I needed for my title. Bynum manages a style that is both erudite and easy to read, and her scholarship is of course phenomenal. Over the course of the text, Bynum uses werewolf tales to show how Medieval culture perceived the issue of identity, that identity was considered to persist through changes (such as becoming a werewolf) from hybridity and metamorphosis. She calls on Dante, Ovid, Marie de France, and Gerald of Wales to illustrate her argument, and concludes that ""Our concern with how we can change yet be the same thing — our fascination with the question of identity in all its varieties — is inherited from traditions. The identity we carry with us questions — and by questioning conforms — itself. In this sense, we are all Narcissus, as we are all also the werewolf, a constantly new thing that is nonetheless the same"" (p. 189). What surprized me about the book is that it comprises four lectures Bynum gave on various occasions and that those lectures are presented with no attempt to blend them into more cohesive book chapters. I'm not sure whether this omission matters, but it did recall for me an on-going discussion about expectations in the humanities about how books ought to be presented and whether the requirements for dissertations should be changed to allow collections of essays to make it more possible for students to complete their doctoral degrees."
7718,The Metamorphosis,Peter Kuper,3.78,2557,259,Anna Gutierrez,4,"A man wakes up one day to find he has been changed into a large insect. The story follows his efforts to deal with this, and his family's reaction to the change. But it's not just a story about a man turning into a insect, it's a clever way of writing about how a family would deal with the main breadwinner in the house becoming unable to work, the way a family reacts to someone who is disabled. It could also be an analogy for how a family treats a member of the family who is now old and needs to be cared for. The man who is now a insect, is forced to live in his room, shut away from the world, for fear that he will frighten anyone who enters the house. The man who once provided for the family, and thought of them above himself, has now become a burden on them, as they are now short of money, and have to find employment. The once able and hard-working man, transformed into a insect, is now rejected, and his family blame him for their financial situation and the fact that they cannot move to a smaller house, because they need to have a room to keep him in. The descriptive quality of the writing is excellent, and although it is a sad and gruesome tale, it is also very funny in parts; I couldn't help laughing out loud a couple of times."
7725,The Metamorphosis of Baubo: Myths of Woman's Sexual Energy,Winifred Milius Lubell,4.44,16,3,Adrienne Kiser,5,"What a wonderful book! My only previous encounter with the figure of Baubo was quite a few years back ago when I first read ""Women Who Run With the Wolves"", in which Baubo is briefly mentioned. In that book, Baubo is referenced as the ""belly goddess"" who deals in laughter and embodies the idea of embracing our sexual nature with joy and good humor. Unfortunately, I learned from the same book that very little is known about Baubo.Imagine my surprise when I discovered Lubell's well-written and informative book! The stories and artwork surrounding Baubo, as well as the explanations of how her figure has been oft maligned by the patriarchal society of years past, are presented in an incredibly accessible manner. I was engaged in the information throughout.It is not uncommon for books on the mythology of women to fall into the unfortunate trap of man-bashing. Yes, much of our recorded history takes place in patriarchal societies that relegated women to a lower class. Yes, as a result there has been a downplay in the importance of female mythological figures throughout time. Is that the fault of men we encounter in society today? Absolutely not. There are legitimate concerns with how women are treated in modern times, but the guy in line next to you at the grocery store is hardly responsible for the repression of art by an archaeologist in the 1700s.Fortunately, Lubell's book skillfully avoids doing this - the faults of the past are treated with an objective eye and without judgment. She keeps the focus on Baubo herself and her book is all the better for it. This is an absolutely fascinating read for anyone interested in the history of women in religious mythology."
7724,The Metamorphosis and Other Stories,Franz Kafka,4.01,40127,1291,Matthias,4," The Metaphormosis - a tiny taleThe field lay sparkling in the sun. The cold night had covered it with a white blanket which the grass was now reluctant to shed. The distant sun did not mind the ground’s slumber. It gazed benevolently down to the field and saw shimmers of its big bright self reflected in the small flakes that had bundled together into an untouched canvas of astonishing whiteness. Everything was still. Birds flew over in silence, forest creatures stayed under the trees and dared not approach the beauty that presently lay beyond the shadowy safety offered by the canopy. The canvas would not be written upon, not today, for nature itself was too proud of what it had created overnight. The sun sent its rays down to the snow, not to make it melt, but to let it dance in sunshine. Everything was still, everything was beautiful. Evening came and the dance grew less abundant, slowly fading to a twinkling that would last through the night and form a perfect pair with the starry sky. The next morning she woke up with a startle. A coldness was touching her back and was making a sound that seemed very alien to her. In fact, the waking up itself felt very strange. She didn’t remember doing that before. All she knew was that she was magnificent. She turned around and found a man lying beside her, snoring. His breath was cold, his features blank. She didn’t recognize him, but she was unafraid. Curious in fact. Gently, she nudged him awake and when he opened his eyes she saw a bright sparkle that made her fall in love instantly. It was a strange feeling, even stranger than waking up had been. It filled her with warmth and all the questions she felt but didn’t know the words for evaporated into nothingness. She understood everything there was to understand and smiled down at the beautiful eyes gazing up at her.He didn’t know where he was. He had been dreaming, but could not remember what about exactly. He had been moving, there were melodious sounds, and a lot of light. A dream of dancing, he guessed, even though he had no idea what that was. All that dreamily moving about did make him feel sore and stiff upon waking up and he found himself unable to move. He definitely would have liked to move. There was a beautiful woman in his bed, looking with warm and loving eyes into his face. The only thing he could do however was look back in wonder and hope the stiffness would melt away.Doubts began to creep up on her. Why didn’t the man with those loving eyes do something? Why was he just lying there? Why did he feel so cold? She frowned, at least she thought that’s what she was doing, and decided to get up and get some distance from the cold presence. A resplendent flicker of light caught her eye. It came from a surface right next to the bed and as she approached it the light emanating from it became brighter. It wasn’t until she was standing right in front of this mysterious manifestation that she saw and felt how magnificent it was. A light, an energy, full of warmth and full of life. He saw her move out of bed, towards something that looked like a lake. The surface, framed in finely carved wood, was reflecting the woman in all her glory. Only, the lake stood vertically, which was rather unusual for lakes, and for some reason the fluid quality of the water had gone, making it stay completely fixed within its frame . A frozen lake then, only without the misty haze that normally came with frost. While his thoughts ran wild on the nature of what he was looking at, he remained motionless, continuously amazed. The woman felt the cold stare between her shoulder blades. As she had been basking in warmth she found herself all the more shocked when she turned around to see that the man was still just lying there, eyes cold. Why didn’t he return the warmth she was so generously giving? Why didn’t he come alive at the touch of her gentle fingers? Why was the only thing that he could do just look? Yes, there was that sparkle. That beautiful twinkle in his eyes whenever she looked at him. But surely she deserved more than that? Surely her body deserved more than to be treated with an icy touch and a cold breath? A hot fury rose from deep within her. She wouldn’t let this man vanquish her, make her doubt herself, make her lose her radiant energy! She would give him more than he deserved, showing him and herself what she is capable of. She would shake him, shake him awake, shake him into giving her what she deserved. She approached the bed, intent on loving without remorse, and made the room explode with light.The man, transfixed, lay still, saw the bright shape approach, felt anger in its warmth and grew more terrified with every step she took. He could not run, nor hide, so he did the only thing he was capable of. He closed his eyes, hoping it would all be over soon. Another day came and the blanket of white was gone. Where there was dancing only two days ago, there was now black mud. Where there was a blue sky, clouds shrouded the sun in mourning and isolation. Birds landed and picked away at the field, seeds were swallowed and worms were too slow to escape the hungry beaks. The forest animals came out and played around in the grayness of morning. They trampled little mounds of earth and scared away the gluttonous birds. Within all that movement there lay a couple of seeds in waiting. Waiting for this day’s glum spectacle to be over. Waiting to be met by the sun’s nourishing gaze. Waiting to once again be the flowery patch of colors and smells they were before the blanket came. Their time would come, and it would come soon. They knew it would, as the animals returned to their forest, the birds flew back to the sky and the clouds receded to make way for a night full of stars and promises. "

9372,Skinny Legs & All,Tom Robbins,4.03,36700,1292,Greg,5,"I can't think of any other book I've read very recently that left my mind as thoroughly blown as Skinny Legs and All. I'd only read one other Tom Robbins book -- Still Life With Woodpecker -- so I was prepared for his playfulness, humor, intricate (but goofy) language, and overall trippy feel that all come with just about everything he rights.But I was not prepared for Skinny Legs. This book is so dense with literary magnificence that you could chew it like you had a whole mouth full of sticky bubble gum. I dog-eared more pages and marked more passages in this book than any other I've ever read by a long shot.Skinny Legs deals with so many topics, many of which are classical in nature: love, sex, family, art, compassion, work, religion. But it all revolves around a more specific point of the conflicts in the Middle East, primarily between Jews and Arabs. There's lots of history, spirituality, and ridiculousness all spun together -- about the Middle East especially but also about everything else surrounding it (both geographically and more abstractly). Were I a teacher of Middle East studies or any subject that dealt with the Judaism/Islam conflict specifically, this book would be required reading if for no other reason than to lighten the tension -- but hopefully also to open some minds and spark a more creative and intelligent dialogue built not on dogma but on critical thinking and compassion.The book says great things about all the topics it touches on, but to the topic of the Middle East specifically it is blazingly relevant and even prophetic in its own right. Even now, with the book being 18 years old, it hasn't lost a lick of power or shown its age. Nothing in the writing itself ever gave me the impression that the book was written any earlier than yesterday.Anyway, I'm mostly just spitting out tidbits -- let me try to formulate something more concrete. It was very, very good. Long and complex, but good. Robbins is a master of language and imagery. He gives the impression of writing with very reckless abandon. It's like he scribbled down every single thing that came to his mind while writing the story, omitting nothing and not even considering apologizing for such craziness. And yet, it works. The madness all comes together without ever seeming structured hardly at all. As if there's not a method to the madness, but that the method IS the madness.In fact I wish my review of the book could be half as perfectly cohesive as the novel itself managed to be in the end. I could rant and ramble about this fantastic book for hours on end (and probably will to my poor unfortunate friends and acquaintances), but I'll just start wrapping up and say that this one is indeed highly recommended. It's not the quickest read in the world because you have to use your brain, sense of humor, and imagination rather extensively and mostly constantly -- but it's very, very worth it.I'm not normally quite this scatterbrained in my reviewing of a book, but it really was that good!"
2227,Questions and Answers on Death and Dying: A Companion Volume to On Death and Dying,Elisabeth Kübler-Ross,4.1,183,11,Christian Engler,5,"Questions & Answers on Death and Dying is an extremely helpful resource to those who are bereaved or are on the cusp of being so. It is also a good introductory book, as was its predecessor-On Death and Dying-to the area of counseling psychology, specifically thanatology, the study of death and dying, for there are many issues in the dying process that are addressed: nonverbal symbolic language, prolongation of life, sudden death, suicide and terminal illness, fear, faith and hope to old age and just plain coping. Encompassed in the very latter, coping-wise, is not simply the patient and family but also the medical staff. The dynamics of dying have a process and to witness a loved one going through that process is obviously painful; it is the agonizing but inevitable hurt that no one wants to go through. But it can and will make the living stronger. This work in particular is helpful in many respects, because it is not necessarily a ""how-to"" guide on how to grieve or cope; it simply tries to answer the most fundamental and frequently asked questions that people have in respects to death and dying, i.e. emotional and physical pain, loneliness, anger against God and healthy people and finding some caliber of meaningfulness in their life while simultaneously being in the throes of the dying process. The questions asked are sincere, moving and eloquent. The dam of curiosity is opened, and Elizabeth Kubler-Ross eloquently answers all questions, even ones we would not even think of asking. Her insightful and kindhearted responses go to the core of what we're all essentially curious about; she herself admits that in doing this work, it has created a religious belief system that she believed was nonexistent, as one question illustrates: ""In all your research on death, what is your personal belief of what happens after death?"" ""Before I started working with dying patients, I did not believe in a life after death. I now do believe in a life after death, beyond a shadow of a doubt."" What is so nice about this book is that it is a gap filler to the first book. What Elizabeth Kubler-Ross started with in On Death and Dying, the general public-the living and the dying (by their questions)-completed with Questions & Answers on Death and Dying; it went full circle, and it reads as such. This is a valuable work to have. Many, many topics are addressed, and there is no compassionate condescension or nihilistic overtones, just truth, information and loving understanding."
2226,On Death and Dying,Elisabeth Kübler-Ross,4.15,19901,370,Dolors,4,"This book is a sample of three seminars about life, death and the transition between both delivered by Dr. Kübler-Ross, an eminence in Near-death studies and a pioneer in researching the five stages of grief. Ross’ work mingles spirituality with rigorous science and has helped hundreds of dying people of all ages, particularly children, and their families to make peace with death and to accept it as a door to another sort of existence.According to Dr. Ross’ observations, right after death, the body becomes an empty chrysalis and some sort of spiritual energy that was retained in life is set free; using Dr.Ross' simile, like a worm which has undergone a transformation and become a butterfly that all of a sudden has wings to fly. This ethereal entity knows all, loves all and lives on eternally.I am not courageous enough to declare myself an atheist, I feel more comfortable with the term agnostic, but I am not certainly religious in the classical sense of the word, so I approached this book with caution and even a certain degree of skepticism.Nevertheless, if you manage to suspend judgment and put your little ego aside along with all the fears and flimsy arguments that you repeat to yourself like a mantra to explain the inexplicable, you might find Dr. Kübler-Ross’ experiences worthy of reading, and who knows, even as an alternative possibility to consider. Regardless of your intellectual reaction to Ross’ theories, I think this woman’s biggest feat is the kind of love she professed, the selfless involvement with the moribund patients that she treated for more than twenty-five years and the all-abiding humanity that exudes from her words.Even if I might not be ready to fully believe that there is life after death, I can apply many of Dr. Kübler-Ross’ reflections to make the most of my earthly life by loving it, loving the people who share it with me and by making the most of my short time here with a positive attitude, regardless of the challenges ahead. So Kudos, and thank you, Mrs. Kübler-Ross."
6313,"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (Charlie Bucket, #1)",Roald Dahl,4.11,499118,8650,Patrick,5,"Tonight I just finished reading Charlie and the Chocolate factory with my son. This is the first chapter book I've read all the way through with him. And it was a ton of fun. First off, I'll admit that I love the movie. I grew up with it. (I'm talking about the Gene Wilder version, of course.)I'll even admit to liking the movie better than the book. Which is something that doesn't happen very often with me. That said, the book is really, really good. It held my four-year old's attention. It's silly, and it's fun. And it's DARK. For those of you who haven't read the book, let me underline this fact for you. Dahl takes pains to really detail the fact that Charlie and his family aren't just hungry and poor. They're destitute. Charlie sleeps on a mattress on the floor. In the winter they are cold, and they're starving to death. And if you think I'm exaggerating on that last point, I'm not. One of the chapters is titled: The Family Begins to Starve. But you know what? I like this book better because of that. It's not sanitized pablum written by committee to be inoffensive. It's the story of a little boy who is in a fucking awful situation, but he is still good and kind and polite and then something really nice happens to him. That's a trope I can get behind. Its it a good book to read with your kids? Absolutely. That said, allow me to tangent off and share my thoughts as a total bastard:If Willie Wonka actually hired workers and paid them a living wage, maybe Charlie Bucket wouldn't be starving to death in the first place. Follow me here. Wonka is effectively running a company where everyone is paid in scrip. The Oompa Loompas are paid, quite literally, in beans. Beans that I'm guessing he has the Oompa Loompas themselves growing in some huge underground cavern. Let's not even get into the ethical tarpit of the fact that Wonka uproots an entire indigenous culture and enslaves them. Let's just look at this from a raw numbers point of view. Pure economics. The Oompa Loompas work in the factory. They are not paid. They never leave the factory. That means they don't pay rent. They don't buy groceries. They don't go to the movies, or take taxis ,or buy clothes. But *everyone* buys Wonka's chocolate. That means that money goes into the factory, but it doesn't come back out into the town. As a result, the local economy is crap. And it's because of this that Charlie's dad can't get a decent job. What's more, it's because of this that his dad *loses* his shitty job, and his family is starving to death. Willie Wonka isn't a childlike magic maker. He's a billionaire corporate fuckwit. He's the candy equivalent of Monsanto. There's no government oversight there. Osha would never have approved that bullshit boiled sweet boat and chocolate river. No. Dude is untouchable. And don't tell me he isn't. That shit that goes on with the other kids? Nobody even *thinks* of suing him. None of the parents even *hint* at it. He probably owns half the judges in the state, and a handful of senators, too. He's a fucking supervillian. And I would paid serious money to see a story where Batman kicks his ass. *End Rant* In closing, let me share something that Oot said while I was reading him this book: ""Dad, Willie Wonka is just a regular human, but he *is* a little bit of a wizard like you.""

4519,A Framework for Understanding Poverty,Ruby K. Payne,3.88,3590,509,Riku Sayuj,4," Building High-Achieving SchoolsThe book is primarily directed at building a model for combating poverty by tackling them at the earliest level of perpetuation - in schools.Schools, Payne advocates, should be our first line of defense against encroaching poverty and also our most effective weapon to beat it back. Unlike most economic tools, schools can be fine-tuned and  deployed according to strict frameworks.The thrust is thus primarily on how to deal with poverty in schools and how to equip the students with tools and education to fight their way out of it.For this teachers have to understand what poverty is and the disadvantages that characterize poverty — these are usually classed as inherent problems of the students, instead they have to be reframed as disadvantages that are the duty of the teachers to correct in any decent school environment.The ‘Framework’ in the title is then a Framework for the Teachers.A Framework For TeachersPayne uses what he calls an ‘Additive Model’, implicit throughout this book, as a vital tool for better understanding and addressing poverty, as well as the underlying factors that perpetuate it.Some of the most important aspect of the Model are:1. Identifies the mindsets and patterns that individuals use to survive different economic environments-and provides a vocabulary to talk about it.2. Identifies strengths and resources already found in the individual, family, school, and community-and adds new information and a new perspective for creating and growing resources.3. Offers economic diversity as a prism through which individuals and schools can analyze and respond to their issues.4. Identifies skills, theories of change, program designs, partnerships, and ways of building schools where students achieve.5. Encourages the development of strategies to respond to all causes of poverty.Poverty & Its BaggagesAn individual brings with him/her the hidden rules of the class in which he/she was raised. Even though the income of the individual may rise significantly, many of the patterns of thought, social interaction, cognitive strategies, etc., remain with the individual.Schools and businesses operate from middle-class norms and use the hidden rules of middle class. These norms and hidden rules are not directly taught in schools or in businesses.For our students to be successful, we must understand their hidden rules and teach them the rules that will make them successful at school and at work. We can neither excuse students nor scold them for not knowing; as educators we must teach them and provide support, insistence, and expectations.Out of Poverty: A Resource-KitTo move from poverty to middle class or middle class to wealth, an individual must give up relationships for achievement (at least for some period of time). Two things that help one move out of poverty are:a. Education andb. Relationships.Leaving poverty could indeed be a conscious exercise. Four reasons one chooses to leave poverty are:1. It’s too painful to stay,2. A vision or goal,3. A key relationship, or4. A special talent or skill.Typically, poverty is thought of in terms of financial resources only. However, the reality is that financial resources, while extremely important, do not explain the differences in the success with which individuals leave poverty nor the reasons that many stay in poverty. The ability to leave poverty is more dependent upon other resources than it is upon financial resources. Each of these resources plays a vital role in the success of an individual:1. FINANCIAL: Having the money to purchase goods and services.2. EMOTIONAL: Being able to choose and control emotional responses, particularly to negative situations, without engaging in self-destructive behavior. This is an internal resource and shows itself through stamina, perseverance, and choices.3. MENTAL: Having the mental abilities and acquired skills (reading, writing, computing) to deal with daily life.4. SPIRITUAL: Believing in divine purpose and guidance.5. PHYSICAL: Having physical health and mobility.6. SUPPORT SYSTEMS: Having friends, family, and backup resources available to access in times of need. These are external resources.7. RELATIONSHIPS/ROLE MODELS: Having frequent access to adult(s) who are appropriate, who are nurturing to the child, and who do not engage in self-destructive behavior.8. KNOWLEDGE OF HIDDEN RULES: Knowing the unspoken cues and habits of a group.The education system should be able to equip the students with these vital resources.Knowledge Of Hidden RulesThis aspect might sound a bit esoteric and bears illumination with a couple of examples:1. The importance of Socially Accepted Language:All the state testsSAT, ACT, etc. are require an understanding of formal language (called ‘the formal register’). It is further complicated by the fact that to get a well-paying job, it is expected that one will be able to use formal register. Ability to use formal register is a hidden rule of the middle class. The inability to use it will knock one out of an interview in two or three minutes. The use of formal register, on the other hand, allows one to score well on tests and do well in school and higher education.This use of formal register is further complicated by the fact that these students do not have the vocabulary or the knowledge of sentence structure and syntax to use formal register. When student conversations in the casual register are observed, much of the meaning comes not from the word choices, but from the non-verbal assists. To be asked to communicate in writing without the non-verbal assists is an overwhelming and formidable task, which most of them try to avoid. It has very little meaning for them.Another aspect:Another version of this is noticeable in educated people from the lower segments of society: They often they turn out too formal in their language. And thus cant function so well in intimate/casual social settings, which are also essential for career progression.In a school setting this means that:• Formal register needs to be directly taught.• Casual register needs to be recognized as the primary discourse for many students.• Students need to be told how much the formal register affects their ability to get a well-paying job.• Students need to be told the importance of being adaptive in their registers.2. The importance of learning to Manage Money:One of the biggest difficulties in getting out of poverty is managing money and just the general information base around money. How can you manage something you've never had? Money is seen in poverty as an expression of personality and is used for entertainment and relationships. The notion of using money for security is truly grounded in the middle and wealthy classes.The above are only a couple of simple examples, the reality is much more complex and requires much greater effort from the educational system.Being in poverty is rarely about a lack of intelligence or ability. Many individuals stay in poverty because they don't know there is a choice-and if they do know that, have no one to teach them hidden rules or provide resources. Schools are virtually the only places where students can learn the choices and rules of the middle class.Teachers must recognize a larger role: as Motivators + Educators + Enablers, so must the school system and the governments.It is time we mobilized this important weapon in the fight against poverty."
6582,Nathaniel,John Saul,3.84,4802,124,Dirk Grobbelaar,4,"”I saw something that night.”John Saul is a very deceptive writer. The characters that people his stories are ordinary everyday folk doing ordinary everyday things. Even the horror elements are hardly apocalyptic or grotesque (or perhaps I haven’t read enough of his books yet). Instead, it creeps and crawls and worms its way into the reader’s consciousness. If there isn’t overmuch character development, it’s because the characters come fully formed. These are the kind of people we all know, which makes it so much more disturbing when strange things start happening. We can relate.”I saw something out there.”In Saul’s stories, it’s the little things that kill. Nathaniel is no exception; it’s an insidious novel. There are multiple shades of grey here, and my allegiance kept swinging from one set of possibilities to the next. It’s never very clear what exactly is going on (until, obviously, at the very end), and just when you think you finally have the truth of it some new information is revealed to set you back a step or two. This book requires a bit of “reading between the lines”, so come prepared.That said, it all seems to work in the book’s favour, since reader frustration with character beliefs and perceptions often form an integral part of what makes this a “horror” story. It’s sometimes scary just because you don’t want it to happen.[He], too, sensed the change in the atmosphere, and suddenly felt his skin begin to crawl.Even though it’s a slow-burner and the body count isn’t exactly sky high it does read pretty quickly. Things do pick up at around the halfway mark. And In fact, on more than one occasion I found myself literally forgetting to breathe. Needless to say, it gets pretty tense, especially given Saul’s penchant for distressing endings; you never quite know what to expect. [She] felt a sickness in her stomach as she realized what had gone on in her house so many years ago.Although this isn’t the most horrific novel by today's standards (it lacks hordes of action scenes and buckets of gore to qualify), it still makes for some darn uneasy reading. The subject matter deals with themes like babies being stillborn, creepy family secrets, paranoia, and such, and there is just enough of a supernatural angle to keep your teeth on edge. I enjoyed it a lot; it packs a psychological punch and it kept me guessing. Also, the prairie was an interesting setting.“You don’t believe me, do you?” he said quietly. “You don’t think I saw anything.” "
4517,The Ruby in Her Navel,Barry Unsworth,3.31,595,98,Algernon,4,"“Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.”Reading Barry Unsworth's account of life in 12th century Sicily brings forcefuly in focus the famous George Santayana quote I used as an epigraph.What makes 12 century Sicily so special and so relevant today? It was, for a very short span of time, a viable multi-cultural, interfaith society, where Normans, Saracens, Byzantines, Jews and Papists lived together in almost harmony. It will be brought to ruin by greed, vanity and intolerance (view spoiler)[ most of it coming form the Catholics and their 'divine right' to rule the lesser races. The novel describes the forced expropriations of Muslims, the hatred and mistrust in the aftermath of the crushing defeat of Christian armies in the Second Crusade, and the narrow mindedness of monks ( These Moslems are allowed to live and breed among us, their blood is corrupted, they will corrupt the blood of Holy Church, our blood. ).  (hide spoiler)]The main character, whose name (Thurstan Beauchamp) is a clear indication of his mixed Norman and French blood, is a young clerk working in a ministry (Diwan) dominated by Muslims. He is an idealist, who seems ill suited for the actual job he is doing : a spy for the king, with a cover job as a purveyor of pleasures (hiring dancers, singers and acrobats for the king's entertainment). His naivety is endearing in the beginning of the story, when he expresses his admiration for the job the king is doing keeping the peace between the different ethnicities on the island, his respect for his Arab boss and his belief in the rule of law : ... I was swept by a familiar love for this city of Palermo, where I had spent most of my years, for the diversity these sounds expressed, the different faiths that lived together here, the different races that jostled in the markets and laboured on the buildings that were rising everywhere, praying apart and having their cases tried in their own tongues, but all held together in unity by our great King. The best example Thurstan can give us about what the city of Palermo has to offer is in the description of the Royal Chapel, a key setting of the novel, ""where Saracens had carved the wood of the ceiling, Latins made the marble inlays, Greeks set the stones of the mosaics, all working together to make a church where our Norman King could hear the mass."" As a first person narrator, Thurstan can be somewhat excused for trying to paint himself in a positive light, but his later actions speak louder about his envious and vain nature, his ambition to become a knight, his gullibility and the shallowness of his fine principles when confronted with life and death situations (view spoiler)[ I thought he was particularly clueless about the plot to destroy his Muslim patron and mentor, and that he gave in much too easily to blackmail  (hide spoiler)] . Overall, his human weakness is what will probably reconcile the reader with the wrong decisions Thurstan makes and his youth might excuse his lack of subtlety in the cloak & dagger business and in the romantic dillema between the two women in his life : the elegant and sophisticated Lady Alicia, and the exotic (Yazidi) belly dancer Nesrin. She could not have so deceived me if I had not deceived myself; she could not have played me false if I had not aided her in it. I had fashioned her in the form of my desires, I had made her shining, lustrous from our childhood and the time of my hope, bright with the future when she would make that hope come true, a creature of light, not her own, bestowed on her. She had no light of her own ... All in all, this was an informative, multi-layered historical adventure, more serious than its unfortunately chosen title might suggest, that manages to recreate one of the most exciting moments in early Middle Age history, touching on still relevant issues regarding a multi-cultural society, coupled with a dramatic coming of age story of a young man who learns to see the rust, the dirt and the blood hiding under the shiny armours of the knights and under the immaculate robes of the monks. This disillusionment with both government and religion is another factor that remains relevant in the present day, when young men and women must find the strength and the moral guidance they need in other institutions or creeds.  [I have learned that] ... there had never been a silver barge to keep afloat, that this King to whom I had woved my service, was a man with a face like other faces I had seen, the face of one who lived with us in the dark water, among the other creatures feasting and fighting there. Barry Unsworth captivated me previously with ""The Songs of Kings"" and with ""Morality Play"", and confirmed his status as one of the best in the field with the present historical novel. Next on my radar is ""Sacred Hunger"", dealing with another thorny subject - slavery."

Siempre que leo a este excelente autor, no solo entro en su historia, sino que también la siento. Yo caminaba por la lúgubre Barcelona de 1979, junto con los dos entrañables protagonistas, Oscar y Marina. Podía ver cómo la niebla de esa ciudad encantada nos besaba la piel y los oscuros caminos que se presentaban ante nosotros nos susurraban un secreto inaudible. Recuerdo con inquietud que nos acercamos para tratar de comprender qué nos decían, hasta que la negrura nos consumió. Ya era demasiado tarde para volver. La única manera de escapar de esa telaraña de mentiras y confidencias era liberar a los fantasmas de una Barcelona que se rehusaba a iluminarse, a mostrarnos su cara más vergonzosa.Y como una canción que se escucha desde lejos, almas en vela, cuerpos con un pasado efervescente empezaron a cantar. Barcelona comenzó a vibrar, el engranaje oxidado se movió de nuevo. El soñador se volvió insomne y las nubes, testigos de un horror que sobrepasaba lo fantástico. La verdad limpió la suciedad de lo que reposaba hace años. Y lo que siempre estuvo debajo de nosotros empezó a gritar: las alcantarillas exigían el obsequio de la curiosidad. Y el peligro aumentaba. Lo que era un juego de niños pasó a ser un limbo entre la vida y la muerte. Los secretos que tanto añorábamos conocer nos traicionaron. Mi corazón danzaba en mi pecho, tratando de escapar de su cárcel de huesos. Mis compañeros, Oscar y la bella Marina, se concedían una mirada que lo decía todo.Algo pasaba a mi alrededor, justo al lado mío, como un burbuja flotando en el aire: siempre estuvo ahí, pero si no mirás con atención, será difícil que la notes. Un aura suave y diáfana rodeaba a mis amigos. Oscar y Marina eran algo más. Eran algo hermoso, que estaba fuera de mi percepción. Sus sonrisas eran más que sonrisas, sus roces encerraban una calma efímera y a la vez infinita. Pero sentía un desasosiego corrosivo en mi interior. Era como estar en una habitación llena de gente hablando al mismo tiempo, y que, a lo lejos, arañando esa cacofonía, una voz quebrada y pudorosa esté musitando en solitario. No lograba identificar qué era. Espero descubrirlo pronto. Y que los secretos por fin sean desvelados.O quizá sean imaginaciones mías, quién sabe.

4820,"Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community, and War",Nathaniel Philbrick,3.86,27922,2172,Candi,3,"I have to admit, I am one of those naïve Americans that has walked around in a bit of a fantasy land when it comes to the history of Plymouth and the Pilgrims. From grade school, I knew they desired freedom to worship their religion without persecution. In order to do so, they faced a difficult journey aboard the Mayflower prior to landing on the shores of New England. There’s a giant rock on which they must have set foot after disembarking from the ship. I know the Pilgrims struggled to survive and the Native Americans came to their rescue. They celebrated the First Thanksgiving with the Native Americans, a holiday which we now sit down to every November in order to indulge and give thanks. Well, that’s it in a nutshell, right? Or so I believed! Nathaniel Philbrick, however, has set me straight and enlightened me way more than I could ever have imagined! Mayflower is extremely well researched and undeniably well-written. However, it is quite dense with very detailed information regarding much more than the voyage of the Mayflower and the original settlement of Plymouth colony. Philbrick takes us beyond those years through the next couple of generations and presents a factual account of the violent and bloody wars fought between the New Englanders and the Native Americans. The first Thanksgiving most certainly did not end in a ‘happily ever after’ situation. There were numerous conflicts, various alliances between the New Englanders and Native Americans, and treachery. I was often quite shocked to learn of the behavior exhibited by some of the Pilgrims’ descendants. It wasn’t very pretty and not something I feel proud to claim as part of my American heritage. Speaking of heritage, Philbrick tells us that ""In 2002 it was estimated that there were approximately 35 million descendants of the Mayflower passengers in the United States, which represents roughly 10 percent of the total U.S. population."" Philbrick, however, does tell us the good with the bad and we also learn of some of the more upstanding descendants. Little tidbits of facts like this were what I enjoyed most about the book. It helped me slog through some of the more textbook-like sections when I knew I might find a little nugget of information I could perhaps read aloud to my husband – or maybe even share with the family at our Thanksgiving gathering in a couple of weeks from now. I may hesitate to share this view though - ""Fifty-six years after the sailing of the Mayflower, the Pilgrims’ children had not only defeated the Pokanokets in a devastating war, they had taken conscious, methodical measures to purge the land of its people."" Perhaps we will have to seriously indulge a bit before smashing the myth all to bits! My favorite little chronicle was one which involved Captain Benjamin Church, principal aide to Plymouth’s governor, Josiah Winslow. During one of the final skirmishes of King Philip’s War, several Native Americans were taken as captives. When Church asked one of the older captives his name, he was answered with ‘Conscience’. Philbrick tells us that Church replied, ""Conscience, then the war is over, for that was what they were searching for, it being much wanting."" Indeed! I found this to be a worthwhile read, although a bit dry throughout the middle to last sections of the book. Last year I read Philbrick’s In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex and found it to be immensely entertaining and quite effortless. It read much like fiction, and so I expected much of the same with Mayflower. However, in my opinion, this was more like the sort of non-fiction book from which I previously steered away – one which presents copious facts and dates to the extent that I feel like I am back in school. Some readers that enjoy a myriad of detail will quite enjoy this. History buffs should have no complaints since Philbrick has done his job well here. Since I did enjoy parts of this book and am grateful to be considerably more educated on the topic of the Pilgrims and King Philip’s War, I have rated Mayflower 3.5 stars. "
4823,On The Mayflower,Kate Waters,3.76,87,10,Ebookwormy1,5,"A fitting addition to Kate Waters' series on Plimouth Plantation, ""On the Mayflower"" takes a slightly different approach.The subtitle: Voyage of a Ship's Apprentice & a Passenger Girl provides a brief glimpse into this alternate view of the Pilgrims. William Small, the Ship's Apprentice, who serves as narrator is a fictional character. The Passenger Girl, Ellen Moore, age 8 (but played by a 10 year old) was on the ship, though there is no record of her in the colony, indicating she probably died on ship or during the long, hard, winter.As such, this book is more a biography of the Mayflower itself than the individual people. Since so little is known the voyage, the text focus' on the duties of William Small as Ship's Apprentice, the construction of the Mayflower, the duties of Ellen as Passenger Girl, the horrible autumn storm that pushed them off course, and the fictional friendship between the two young people.End notes include a brief history of the Mayflower, a rendering of what she may have looked like (with labeling of her decks, sails, etc), as well as an overview of the Mayflower II which is part of the Plimouth Plantation museum. A brief explanation of why the voyage was so difficult, and the storm patterns of the Atlantic is followed by brief biographies of the Mayflower's Master (Christopher Jones), the construction of William Small, Ellen Moore and the actors who interpreted William and Ellen for the publication.I love the straight forward summary of the Pilgrim's experience from a child's perspective, both the good and the bad, that forms this excellent series. It is cherished in our home school. I highly recommend it."
3178,The Phaedrus Of Plato,Plato,3.91,5235,210,Riku Sayuj,5,"     “Every heart sings a song, incomplete, until another heart whispers back. Those who wish to sing always find a song. At the touch of a lover, everyone becomes a poet.” ~ Plato
  

  THE SCHOOL OF LOVE
Phaedrus is commonly paired on the one hand with Gorgias and on the other with Symposium - with all three combining and leading towards Republic. It is compared with Gorgias in sharing its principal theme, the nature and limitations of rhetoric, and with Symposium in being devoted to the nature and value of erotic love. The connection with Republic is more tenuous, though it contributes to the criticism of the arts of Rhetoric. Also, the psychology illustrated here by the image of the charioteer and the two horses is fully compatible with the tripartite psychology of Republic and even clarifies an important ambiguity in it.The SettingSocrates and Phaedrus walks out from Athens along the river Ilisus. The conversation that takes place between Phaedrus and Socrates is both interrupted and motivated by three speeches - one by Lysias, and then two extemporized by Socrates himself in response, inspired to employ his knowledge of philosophy in crafting two speeches on the subject of erotic love, to show how paltry is the best effort on the same subject of the best orator in Athens, Lysias, who knows no philosophy.
  The Three Speeches
The First Speech:The first speech (purportedly by Lysias), is a shallow, badly constructed piece–a ‘clever’ piece of sophistry designed to establish the implausible thesis that the pursued (loved) should gratify someone who is not feeling love (""non-lover"") rather than a true erastēs (lover).The Second Speech:Not surprisingly, since in this speech Socrates undertakes to improve on the form at least as much as the content of Lysias’ speech, there is considerable overlap of theme. Ethically, however, Socrates appears to have more genuine concern for the good of the ‘loved’ than Lysias did.But most interestingly, Socrates takes the dichotomy of Lysias’ speech - of Non-Lover Vs Lover - and inverts the whole argument by subsuming both categories into Lust. It is left unsaid till the Third Speech, but Socrates has now effectively made the argument into Lust Vs Love (Non-Lover also included into Lust). Ever heard of the expression “Platonic Love”? It is far more interesting than its popular meaning!
  “These are the points you should bear in mind, my boy. You should know that the friendship of a lover arises without any good will at all. No, like food, its purpose is to sate hunger. ‘Do wolves love lambs? That’s how lovers befriend the loved!’”

  The Third Speech (The Palinode):
Lysias’ speech had argued that a lover is to be avoided in favor of a non-lover, and in Socrates’ first speech he seeks merely to improve upon this thesis of Lysias, but in the second he entirely repudiates the content of the first, and he calls this second speech a recantation, or palinode.The straight-forward opposition of pleasure and the good in the Second Speech, though reminiscent of early dialogues such as Gorgias, is thus undermined in the palinode, where we see that the impulse towards pleasure is an essential part of a person’s motivation, and that if his/her rational part is in control, this impulse can be channelled towards the good.The Palinode thus gives a less one-sided view of love - a view in which love and reason can go hand in hand, in which love is not entirely selfish but can be associated with educational and moral values, and in which, at the same time, passion and desire find their proper place. In order fully to praise love, Plato felt that he had to explain its place in the metaphysical life of a human being - through a myth, as usual.The overall movement of the central part of the palinode is that it begins with a vision of the soul’s purpose and ends with an analysis of the human condition of love.The suggestion is that we won’t understand human experience unless it is put into a much larger context, and that the experience of love is essential for a human being to fulfill his/her highest potential.After these three speeches, the conversation turns to the value of rhetoric in general, and what could be done to make it a true branch of expertise or knowledge.On Rhetoric: An AsideA dialogue earlier than Phaedrus, Gorgias, is devoted to rhetoric and to the contrast between the rival ways of life philosophy and rhetoric promote. In Phaedrus, the question of the value of rhetoric is raised immediately after the palinode, and signals an abrupt change of direction for the dialogue: as to what constitutes good and bad rhetoric, and Socrates suggests that knowledge of truth is the criterion: persuasion without knowledge is denigrated: without a grasp of truth, rhetoric will remain ‘an unsystematic knack’.Now, this too is a reference to Gorgias, where rhetoric was defined in just these terms. Plato does not really seem have changed his mind about it since Gorgias.There are two main overt topics in the dialogue––rhetoric and love. Rhetoric is meant to persuade, and a lover will try to persuade his/her beloved to gratify their desires (the Greek word for ‘persuade’ also means ‘seduce’). The lover’s search for the right kind of beloved to persuade is a specific case of the general principle that the true rhetorician must choose a suitable kind of soul with the help of dialectical insight. The lovers are said to try to persuade their beloveds to follow a divine pattern - this is the highest educational aspect of love.Thus the dialogue is about love and rhetoric, as it seems to be, but they are connected because both are forms of ""soul-leading"" - both are educational.So for this reviewer, the question of which to focus on - of Rhetoric 
  or
 Love - is redundant. A focus on either should serve the purpose, and the focus for the rest of this review will be on Love. Rhetoric got its space 
  in the Gorgias review.

  Love: The Guiding Light of Philosophers
The first two speeches raise the question whether or not love is a good thing, and the rest of the dialogue answers the question in the affirmative. Love is good because it enables one to draw near to another person whose soul is of the same type as one’s own, but is capable of becoming more perfectly so. This educational potential will be fulfilled provided the pair channel their energies into mutual education; this is the proper context of the praise lavished on the combination of philosophy and love.Platonic Love: A ClarificationBefore we go further, we need to address the standard criticism on “Platonic Love”: that it is about non-sexual love. More importantly, the even more educated criticism has to be addressed: that it is about Homoerotic love.For this, we need to take a look at the Athenian society of the time:First, the Athenians rarely married for love: a wife was for bearing children, while slave-girls were used for extra sex. Love, then, was more likely to be met outside marriage––and it might be a younger man who aroused it. And this goes not just for love, but even for the shared interests that underpin love: the educational potential of a love-affair, always one of the main things that interested Plato, was unlikely to be fulfilled in one’s marriage, since an Athenian male had few shared interests with his wife and would not expect her to be interested in education. Second, with women being seen more or less entirely as sex-objects, Plato clearly felt that it was all too easy to get caught by the physical side of a heterosexual relationship. However, since Athenian society did place a slight stigma on the sexual side of a homoerotic relationship, a lover might well hesitate before consummating the relationship in this way––and such hesitation, vividly portrayed in Phaedrus, meant that there was at least the opportunity for the sexual energy to be channelled towards higher, spiritual or educational purposes.Moreover, the older man was expected to cultivate the boy’s mind – to be an intellectual companion. It was, in effect, a form of education. Greek education was pitiful: restricted to upper-class boys, and taught no more than the three Rs, sport, Homer and the lyric poets, and the ability to play a musical instrument. In a peculiar way, the Athenian institution of homoerotic affairs filled a gap by providing a boy with a more realistic grasp of local culture and worldly wisdom.Thus, we can see why homoeroticism is the context - only because it was normal then and not because it was regarded as worthy of special attention against a standard of heterosexuality as ‘normal’.Transposed on to present society, we can see that the whole enterprise should logically apply now to ‘normal’ or heterosexual relations as well - and is quite in character for the modern times - some would even say that it is the ideal!Thus, glossing over homoeroticism as a relic of the Athenian society, we need to read instead from our own society’s standpoint. Hence, in this review you will find that the ‘love’ spoken of is directed not at a ‘boy’ as in the Platonic dialogue/society but at the ‘loved’ (as substituted by the reviewer), without discrimination. This is also the most useful (and logical) POV for this reviewer to adopt to understand the dialogue best. Also, please assume the he/she or his/her connotation if the reviewer has omitted it at places.
  The Myth: Love as The Window to the Universe
It is often said that Symposium, Republic and Phaedrus should be read together. This is particularly true when it comes to the interconnected Myths that populate these three dialogues.Poetic and inspiring myths portray the soul’s vision of reality and love in The Symposium as well as in Phaedrus:In his myth in The Symposium, Plato has Aristophanes present the famous story about soul mates:The myth in Phaedrus, altering this, is a description of the entire cycle of what can happen to a soul: we hear of the tripartite nature of souls and how it is essential to a winged soul to rise up attempt to see the plain of truth which lies beyond. In the Myth, we are incarnated as humans if the attempt was not fully successful, doomed for thousands of years.A philosophically-inclined-lover, however, can use his/her memory of Forms, to regrow their wings and ascend again. This Memory is triggered by the glimpse of Beauty in his/her beloved - if his love of truth is enough to leave him with a lingering dissatisfaction with every day life. Beauty alone has this privilege, to be the most clearly visible and the most loved - and thus the trigger for the Quest for meaning.Love & Memory: Mutual AssistantsReaders and admirers of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance would find this section particularly identifiable. Love as remembrance should also find ready acceptance among Proust readers. In fact, the image of the loved triggering a vision of beauty that unlocks the memory of life’s true purpose is just about as Proustian as it gets. ‘Loved’ then need not be a person at all - it just needs to be a store of memory, personally beautiful enough to trigger the vision of the ‘beyond’ of everyday life, but this is a digression.In the palinode, love and memory are critically connected: love is our reaction to the half-remembered Form of Beauty (and of Truth). The starting-point is the perception of beauty on earth, and the consequent recollection of Beauty seen before. The beloved’s face acts, as it were, as a window on to the Form.In short, love prompts recollection, recollection is the precondition for knowledge, and knowledge is the precondition for the right handling of words. In this way, all the major themes of the dialogue tie together.
  The Chariot of Life: The Rider & The Horses
The Soul is divided in three at the beginning of the Myth - two parts in the form of horses and the third in that of a charioteer. One of the horses is good, the other not; one white, noble and the aide of Reason, the other unruly, Black and crazed with desire. The difference between the two is that the bad horse’s reasoning is limited to short-term goals (just as Lysias’ non-lover was too), whereas the charioteer aims for and considers the overall goodness of a person’s life as a whole.This is, in fact, very reminiscent of 
  The Bhagavad Gita
 with the Senses as the Horses and Reason as the Charioteer.
  
    Philosophy, Love & Lust - An Inventory of Usefulness
  
Plato chose the term erōs from the range of possibilities because of its frankly passionate connotations. In Phaedrus he gives an astonishing analysis of what, in his view, is really happening beneath the surface of a love-affair, and focuses particularly on its ecstatic aspects - the ability of love to get us to transcend our normal bounds. Notice, then, how far removed this conception of love is from what we generally understand by the phrase ‘platonic love’, which is defined by my dictionary as ‘love between soul and soul, without sensual desire’. On the contrary, ‘sensual desire’ has to be present, because it is the energizing force.The Two Horses symbolize Love and Lust, in a fashion:The Black Horse/Lust/Sensual Desire is crucial to the process: It is the one that gets us close enough to the beloved/soulmate in the first place!Thus, the non-intellectual elements of the soul were necessary sources of motivational energy and that the passions, and the actions inspired by them, are intrinsically valuable components of the best human life. The intensity of the experience of philosophical love, as Plato sees it, is precisely the intensity of the simultaneous presence in the lover of passion.To return to the course of the myth, we are told in the second part about the development of a human love-affair. The nature of the love-affair depends entirely, we hear, on how removed the philosopher-partner is from the world (how ascetic he is, in a sense): if he is fully mired in his body, all he will want is sex with the beautiful beloved who arouses his love, but if he is a philosopher the vision of worldly beauty will remind him of heavenly Beauty, and his soul will grow wings and aspire to return to the region beyond heaven where he first caught sight of true Beauty. But Plato stresses that the philosophic lover will not want this just for himself: being attracted to someone like himself––that is, to a potential philosopher––he wants to bring out this potential in his partner. Thus, not only does the philosophical lover educate his partner, but he also educates himself: he ascends the ladder only by pulling someone else up on to the rung he has vacated. The educational aspect of philosophy is here properly fulfilled.The implication is that the kind of lover you are on earth depends, to a large extent, on how philosophic you are, how receptive you are to the vision of Beauty. It depends entirely on you if Love opens the window to Philosophy.
  The Academy of Life: Love
Erōs is the Greek word for ‘passionate love’, and in the context of relations between human beings it means primarily ‘sexual desire’, or even ‘lust’. Because erōs in this sense invariably has a sharply delineated object - it is not just a vacuous feeling of warmth or affection - it suits Plato’s purposes, since his major enquiry is to ask what the true object of love is.Is it no more than it appears to be, or is it something deeper? In Symposium he answers that love is a universal force that energizes and motivates us in whatever we do, because its object is something we perceive as good for ourselves. Its object, self-evidently (at least, for Plato and his fellow Greeks), is beauty.The ultimate, deepest aim of Love, Plato says, is immortality - self-procreation in a beautiful environment. The highest manifestation of this is not the physical procreation of offspring, but the perpetuation of ideas in an educational environment in which the lover takes on the education of the beloved. This is the position taken for granted in Phaedrus.There is also a more prosaic and non-mythical way to approach the message in Phaedrus: As Plato makes plain elsewhere, when he says that someone desires something, he means that he lacks something. So when he says that love is lack, we also need to see what it is that a lover’s soul lacks, and it turns out to be the perfection of itself as a human soul - knowledge or self-knowledge. Someone in love has an inkling of his own imperfection, and is impelled to try to remedy the defect.Though couched in terms of his own metaphysics and psychology, Plato’s description of passionate love will strike an immediate chord with any lover. Love can make philosophers of any of us. Love is important because beauty* is the most accessible Form here on earth and is the primary object of love.* Note that it is always a very personal conception of ‘Beauty’ being referred to - which only the beloved can see - the whole ‘eye of the beholder thing’, if you please. Everyone chooses their love after their own fashion from among those who are beautiful to them, and then treats the loved like his/her very own god, building him/her up and adorning him/her as an image to honor and worship.Hence, Love is the best school possible - a place of mutual, continuous, most interested, interesting and truly involved education that one can ever find. There is nowhere else that you can learn more about the human condition. Enroll in the school of love if you would be philosophers, if you would know the meaning of life. Know Thyself, through Love.
  “You may believe this or not as you like. But, seriously, the cause of love is as I have said, and this is how lovers really feel.”

4821,If You Sailed On The Mayflower,Ann McGovern,3.9,425,45,Heather,5,"This gets an ""amazing"" because my kids were on the edge of the couch listening to this. They spent three nights in a row talking to their dad about it at dinner and it still comes up every now and then. Even the 5-yr-old enjoyed it and has been able to talk about it.This is just a brief overview of the Pilgrims. It covers a bit while in England/Holland then more on the Mayflower itself and then the New World. It took us 3 days to read it. It covers ""all the basics"" you'd need to know. It doesn't hide the fact that it was hard, that people got sick and that they died. But it also doesn't dwell on it. Using actual names and a brief tidbit about them here and there made it seem much more personal.The illustrations are lovely. I thought the question/answer format would irritate me, but it worked well here. This would be all you'd need for the younger grades, but around 3rd grade or so you would want to add a few other books for depth.I don't know if my boys will ever forget the Billington boys who lit a piece of rope while standing by the gunpowder kegs on board the ship. Or the punishment of tying someone's head to their feet (they actually want us to try that one!). And they're looking forward to their Pilgrim meal with real eels - or as one of them suggested, a cake made to look like an eel."
3467,"The People of Sparks (Book of Ember, #2)",Jeanne DuPrau,3.65,43796,3080,Angela,5,"If I could give this book 6 stars, I would. I enjoyed City of Ember as a fun, quick YA read, but this sequel is just as entertaining, while also being profoundly thought-provoking and insightful.I loved that the main characters - Lina and Doon - are honest and warm, with realistic struggles: Doon is still working on controlling his temper, and Lina's curiosity and impulsiveness still tend to cause trouble. However, they are both guided by good advice and a strong conscience, paving the way for growth.Incidentally, I was very surprised to see so many mediocre reviews on this book! I agree that the writing is fairly simplistic, but I actually felt that this contributed to the story, rather than being detrimental (I felt the same about City of Ember). Also, the message never seemed pushy or preachy to me. It's still definitely YA literature, but I highly recommend it for its great plot, wonderful characters, and quiet inspiration."
7881,Little Plum,Rumer Godden,4.2,317,18,Gale,3,"LITTLE GIRLS AT WAR OVER JAPANESE DOLLSRumer Godden specializes in creating a gentle fantasy world where dolls have Lives--or in this case, Thoughts--of their own. Nona and Belinda Fell treasure their three Japanese dolls: Miss Happiness, Miss Flower and Little Peach. These special ""persons"" enjoy their own Japanese dollhouse and clothes, beds, foods (green paint water tea) and celebrate many traditional customs. While the dolls converse privately, the sisters (who are unaware of theri dolls' commuications) plan and dream of a new friendship. They themselves are very different: nine-year-old Nona is neat, polite and very talentd with her creative fingers. While eight-year-old Belinda is a fearless tomboy, a reckless daredevil who defies parental authority, common sense and even the laws of gravity, to satisfy her whims. But things get really interesting when a rich family buys and improves the big House Next Door. What delicious opportunities to observe the doings and possessions as they move it--and there is a daughter too! Gem proves to be a ""motherless"" only child, waited on by her personal nanny and a large household staff--all supervised by an authoritarian aunt. The kindly father is often away on business, but after one trip he brings his daughter a Japanese doll of her own. Poor Little Plum--as the spying girls name her and discover--is neglected by her lonely mistress. Belinda decides to teach the proper care of Japanese dolls to the sulking snob next door, but soon the teasing and critical notes escalate into a non-verbal war between the headstrong young ladies. Will that ""rough child"" ever be allowed in the front door of the wealthy but isolated Tiffany-Jones' mansion? And will Gem ever accept cultural tutelage from mere middle-class English children? This is a delightful read-aloud story for Girls Under Ten. And all women who fondly remember the dolls of their girlhood.  (June 16, 2011. I welcome dialogue with teachers.)"
3266,Majestic Molokai: A Nature Lover's Guide,Cameron Kepler,4,5,1,P.J. Wetzel,5,"This is a coffee table book in the guise of an ordinary trade paperback. It is full of color photos on every page and text written by scientists who have spent a great deal of time doing wildlife surveys on Molokai and other Pacific Islands. They cover the Island end to end, with heavy emphasis on nature, though the culture and people are also featured. It's a fine insider's look at this most Hawaiian of the Hawaiian Islands.I have spent nearly two weeks on Molokai on two separate trips twenty years apart, and bought this book on the first of these trips. My first hand experience dovetails with the experiences portrayed by the authors in pictures and text. Although the book is dated (nearly a quarter century old now), and therefore does not discuss some of the more recent issues such as the Molokai Ranch water rights and wind farm issues. But as a guide to the island's enduring culture and natural beauty, it's pretty much timeless. If you're thinking of visiting 'The Friendly Isle', especially if you're going to do some exploring, I'd recommend you pick up this book to help with your planning."
7216,Feel Like Going Home: Portraits in Blues & Rock 'n' Roll,Peter Guralnick,4.19,339,16,Tim Niland,4,"When this book came out in 1971, it was widely heralded and one of the first of its kind. Guralnick begins by writing a deeply personal history of his engagement with rock and roll which is interesting, since he was in it from the beginning, hearing Little Richard and Elvis as a child and then witnessing its whitewashing as corporate America tried to replace Chuck Berry with Pat Boone (as if.) He wanders through the wilderness of folk and jazz, reads Mailer's self-conscious essay ""The White Negro"" with much hand-wringing before the Beatles and Rolling Stones burst on the scene and the author discovers the blues. Being a true snob at first it is only acoustic folk blues that matter (more authentic, you know.) Dylan was a mystery, but James Brown was a revelation. After this Guralnick moves even more deeply into the blues of all kinds, first with a chapter that tries to place the music into a historical context beginning with a brief discussion of the format and pre-history before settling on Charlie Patton, one of the major figures of the pre-war blues. He is able to secure interviews with men who played with Patton at country parties who talked about what a natural entertainer he was compared to another legendary contemporary, the more taciturn Son House. House had a much longer career, though recording in the 1930' and 40's and then participating in the folk revival of the 1960's. This in turn leads him to another legend - Robert Johnson. He relates what little is known of Johnson, thankfully leaving out the devil at the crossroads nonsense. What comes through is a loner, who worked at his craft, particularly slide guitar that could almost ""talk"" to you and repertoire filled with original and imaginative songs. The book shifts gears now and goes into biographical articles, beginning with an entry on Muddy Waters who was recovering from a serious automobile accident when Guralnick interviewed him in 1970. He relays Muddy's history, moving from Rolling Fork, Mississippi to Chicago connecting with the Chess Record Company and having a strong of hits from the late 1940's to the mid-1950's. At the time of the interview, Muddy hadn't had a hit in a while, though he was still a regular concert draw, especially in Europe and on college campuses, but times had changed. Chess is stumped on how to market him, trying all types of gimmicks that might appeal to a rock/funk audience, and even the once prosperous neighborhood he lives in is starting to crumble. Guralnick is really hitting his stride with these slice of life interviews, and his next one was with the immensely talented but often overlooked guitarist and singer Johnny Shines. He is a direct link to the near-mythical Johnson, having travelled with him in the 30's and retaining quite a bit of his repertoire. He scuffled after Johnson died but then made it to Chicago after the war, recording for JOB and Chess, but things got so hard that he dropped out of music all together in the late fifties and early 1960's. There's a very interesting section of the book where Shines is part of a Chicago Blues package tour and they travel city to city and he becomes increasingly annoyed about having to answer the same Johnson related questions instead of being able to talk about his own music, and he was making some great records in this period. The ""rediscovery"" of Skip James by musicologists in the 1960's was unexpected, and he presents a problem for the author because you get the sense that Guralnick felt that James was a bit of a buffoon because he includes large blocks of James stilted speech and reiterates that James felt himself to be a self-proclaimed genius. On the contrary, he has great affection for Louisiana bluesman Robert Pete Williams, who had shot a man in self-defense and wound up in the notorious Angola prison farm. Finally securing release years later, Williams writes no-holds barred lyrics about life in prison and he is trying to renew himself by learning bottleneck slide to add to his arsenal. The force of nature that was Howlin' Wolf had begun to diminish by the time the author interviewed him, back in the hospital for an infection. He'd had a heart attack but refused to stop working, performing against doctors orders. He tells Wolf fascinating story, learning the harmonica from Sonny Boy Williamson II (Rice Miller) and little guitar, before leaving the farming life to get a radio show and cut some records with Sun in Memphis and then moving on to Chess Records in Chicago. When Wolf was well, the show he could put on was overpowering - Guralnick relates one of his last ones here. Wolf is a distrustful skeptical man, probably rightfully so, but when the spirit moved him there were none like him. The book shifts gears again, moving back to rock and roll and a riotous interview with Jerry Lee Lewis. Lewis smugly claims to have been uniquely formed and influenced by no one, and at this point was riding high in the country charts after dynamiting his rock and roll career by marrying his thirteen year old cousin in 1958. There is a very interesting chapter on Chess Records after the label had been sold to the GRT tape corporation, and after the death of Leonard Chess. The surviving brother Phil Chess and his nephew Marshall run the day to day operations, but the family atmosphere of the 1950's heyday are long gone. The generation gap between Phil and Marshall is clear as is the gap between the new employees and the legendary holdovers like Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf who don't stop by as much as they used to. Guralnick gives a nice thumbnail history of the label, which grew out of a nightclub and a few off the books nod & wink transactions. They got Muddy and Wolf, but missed signing James Brown, but watched as Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley changed the face of music. The book ends with men talking about the old days with a wary eye on the future. Those interested in the history of American vernacular music should definitely check this book out, the interviews in particular make for fascinating reading as the subjects let their guard down for the most part and speak honestly about what their lives in music has been like."
6794,Cloud Atlas,David Mitchell,4.01,174208,17160,B0nnie,5," This book proves David Mitchell can be any writer he chooses. The six novellas that comprise Cloud Atlas are forgeries - and they are original. Each adopts the voice of a distinct author. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts, but all of the parts are superb. It is a sextet, like the one found within the novel, with piano, clarinet, cello, flute, oboe, and violin - every individual instrument pleasing, but when played altogether becomes something different and brilliant - the Cloud Atlas Sextet.Each novella is broken, torn in two, or interrupted, and later continued after the sixth, which is the only one completed in one section. Then the previous five stories are concluded in descending order. 1. THE PACIFIC JOURNAL OF ADAM EWINGWritten as a journal. The first story is a delightful combination of Melville, Defoe, and James Fenimore Cooper. It has the serious tone and charm of 18th and 19th century literature, but goes a bit too far, just short of mockery. It is not parody, nor disrespectful. Somehow it has a layer of - what? invisible mirth? The acknowledgments notes Michael King’s definitive work on the Moriori,  A Land Apart: The Chatham Islands Of New Zealand which provided Mitchell with a factual account of Chatham Islands history. This part of the story is interesting, and adds historical details essential to the plot in the way  Moby Dick  does with whaling information.Moriori, 1877, survivors of the 1835 Maori invasion2. LETTERS FROM ZEDELGHEMLetters, one way. Robert Frobisher, writes amusing accounts of his escapades in Belgium to his lover Rufus Sixsmith while he works for a famous composer as an amanuensis. I pictured Frobisher to be like a young Hugh Laurie. There is something of Waugh, or Nancy Mitford in style and humour. He finds the Adam Ewing journal. The acknowledgments notes ""certain scenes in Robert Frobisher’s letters owe debts of inspiration to

3. HALF-LIVES, THE FIRST LUISA REY MYSTERY It's terrible! in a good way. A classic thriller/mystery/crime novel. Cheesy style and plot: spunky girl reporter, whose father (Lester Rey, now dead) had been a cop fighting corruption. Several highly improbable escapes from certain death. All the clichés of this genre are here and brilliantly strung together. Rufus Sixsmith, the addressee in the previous episode, is a key character and his letters from Zedelghem are discovered after he is murdered.

""Valleysmen only had one god an’ her name it was Sonmi"".Zachry sees a recording of Sonmi's Q & A interview, because there is a small group of advanced survivors, ""Prescients,"" and one arrives on a great ship to live on the island, to learn the ways of these primitive people.

When it turns up as ""a curious dismembered volume"" in the second, damn! I swallowed hard and justified such an appearance as quite possible. Then it is merely mentioned in a manuscript - the third novella - which is being read in the fourth. Got that? making it entirely illogical to continue my belief. And worse: Frobisher says, ""Something shifty about the journal’s authenticity—seems too structured for a genuine diary, and its language doesn’t ring quite true—but who would bother forging such a journal, and why?"" So I'm forced into using doublethink of the highest order. The fact is, you want each of these narratives to be the real one. They are that good. The structure weakens the reader's fantasy that this is ""real"". It becomes very awkward, like explaining a time travel paradox. Still...never underestimate the power of doublethink. Autua, Adam Ewing, Robert Frobisher, Rufus Sixsmith, Timothy Cavendish, Sonmi, Zachry, Meronym, all remain with me... *Sob*."
1145,A Weekend with Warren Buffett: And Other Shareholder Meeting Adventures,Randy Cepuch,3.68,44,8,Andrew Mutch,4,A fairly quick and entertaining read of what goes on at the annual shareholders meeting of publicly traded corporations. The antics of activist shareholders and the efforts of CEOs and corporations to avoid too much scrutiny get equal billing as the author goes from the meetings of some of the largest corporations in the world to some of the smallest. Warren Buffet gets plenty of praise while some other CEOs come off as looking less than honorable. This would mostly appeal to someone with an interest in finance or how corporations are run.
3897,The Healthy College Cookbook: Quick. Cheap. Easy.,Alexandra Nimetz,3.72,50,6,leena_abate,4,"This was my first cookbook and kept me from starving (or ODing on Mac n Cheese) during grad school and my first few months of post-grad life. After that, I got kind of sick of it, to be honest. There are better cookbooks out there and this one doesn't have a ton of recipes, so I made most of the ones that sounded good to me.This book is terrific for those who are new to cooking and don't have a fully stocked pantry already (emphasis on that last bit...the authors of this cookbook are good at keeping the ingredient count down, so you can gradually acquire pantry ingredients instead of having to buy them all at once and go broke).If you're already a semi decent cook, keep looking, though..."
2425,"Compelling Evidence (Paul Madriani, #1)",Steve Martini,3.89,4435,164,Cathy DuPont,4,"First time read for a Paul Madriani book and I really enjoyed the plot and character, Paul Madriani, and especially the courtroom scenes which were a good portion of the book. Great secondary characters too, well described and vivid. Believe I might be a ‘frustrated wannabe lawyer.’ Always, always enjoy these genre of books. It's one of the reasons I loved The Lincoln Lawyer so much. I've read a lot of lawyer/courtroom books; more two hands worth, I'm sure. Great storyline, too, and the ending, well, usually I don't get the 'whodunit' but this one, it was a total, complete surprise to me and was uncovered only in the last five pages or so. What a surprise, a total surprise.Goodreads friend Jim said Martini got somewhat old to him, but now I'm anxious to read another. Not now, but in the near future so he'll be added to the vast collection of series that I'm reading. No worries though. What's another series when I like the character so much, in part, just because he's a lawyer. My only gripe, why doesn't he fire his incompetent secretary? She gives women a bad name because of her lack of brains. Not that she has to be smart, just smart enough to be in the real world and function like she has something 'upstairs.' Only thing that rings now is S-T-U-P-I-D. OK, there I go trying to re-write portions of the book which I really hate for reviewers to do, including myself; but folks, I hate stupid and she just takes the cake. Paul (and Martini) please, just fire her fancy, dancy ass, no one would miss her. "
4307,Aschermittwoch,Ethan Hawke,3.28,2222,211,K.D. Absolutely,3,"Tell me, how many Hollywood actors can write novels? Especially ones who are still active in movies? Especially if there is no co-writer beside his/her name?Ethan Hawke (born 1970) has written two decent novels: The Hottest State (1996) and this book, Ash Wednesday (2002). When these books came out, I was not yet into heavy reading so these did not interest me. But a couple of years back, a member in our Filipinos group here in Goodreads favorably commented on these books so when I saw them in my favorite second-hand bookshop, I bought them right away. Then I realized that it will be Ash Wednesday tomorrow, March 9, 2011 so I finally opened and started reading this book open last Sunday night. I am not really a Hawke’s fan. However, I liked him in Robin Williams-starrer Dead Poets Society (1989) where he played as one of the students and the first to stand up on the desk in the ending scene. Who can forget how he and the beautiful Julie Delphy talked endlessly but intelligently inside the train in Before Sunrise (1995) and again in Before Sunset (2004)? I also enjoyed watching him in the science-thriller Gattaca (1997) faking his inclusion in that training school where only people of superior genes live. However, what really caught my attention was when he sensitively read Fable of the Mermaid and the Drunks, one of Pablo Neruda’s featured poems in the movie soundtrack of Il Postino (The Postman) (1994). The young man has beautiful mind inside his equally beautiful head so it did not really come as a surprise when I saw that he has also authored two novels.Ash Wednesday is a gritty love story between an AWOL soldier,  Jimmy Heartsock and his girlfriend Christy. With his angst, Jimmy is half-Cauldfeld and with his Catholic beliefs, half-preacher. I thought I would like this character because it seems to be multi-dimensional but when I finally closed the book, it just did not make any imprint in my mind especially with the contrived ending where Jimmy decides to stay in the middle between the two obvious choices. The character of Christy makes more sense not only because she knows what she wants but once she makes a decision she goes for it no matter what the odds are. She does not vacillate unlike Jimmy who, despite being a military man, keeps on changing his mind, refuses to give up drugs, and goes fucking girls left and right. However, Hawke’s storytelling has a distinct style: straightforward, cocky yet sincere. It does leave you with a feeling that you are taken for another ride just like after closing and finishing a Nicholas Sparks book. It is not at all mushy like how love stories normally are. Some lines are with sprinklers of Hawke’s own brand of philosophical musings that proves his sensitivity and self-awareness as a person. Good thing that those musings do not go overboard so as to give his readers the chance to have a little room for interpretation and draw out conclusions. Had it gone overboard, I would put a comment here that Hawke has that fondness to state the obvious. An example of this is that the book’s ending is set on an Ash Wednesday (time for reflection and prayers) which ends the Mardi Gras (time for merriment, booze, drugs) in New Orleans. Jimmy got incarcerated the eve of Ash Wednesday and got freed the following day which means that he is a new man and ready to face his responsibility as soon-to-be father and husband to Christy.Despite those weak points, this is still a good read if you are looking for a fresher approach in telling a truthful kick-ass love story. I also had an easy time imagining the characters. I thought of Ethan Hawke as Jimmy and Uma Thurman (to whom he dedicated this novel) as Christy and any of those road-trip American movies and I can say that the book is movie-perfect. Too sad that the movie adaptation of his first novel, The Hottest State did not fly and Hawke is now 41 years old (too old to play Jimmy). Still, the novelist Ethan Hawke can hold a candle for Nicholas Sparks, that one I can assure you."
4309,Ash Wednesday,Ethan Hawke,3.28,2222,211,K.D. Absolutely,3,"Tell me, how many Hollywood actors can write novels? Especially ones who are still active in movies? Especially if there is no co-writer beside his/her name?Ethan Hawke (born 1970) has written two decent novels: The Hottest State (1996) and this book, Ash Wednesday (2002). When these books came out, I was not yet into heavy reading so these did not interest me. But a couple of years back, a member in our Filipinos group here in Goodreads favorably commented on these books so when I saw them in my favorite second-hand bookshop, I bought them right away. Then I realized that it will be Ash Wednesday tomorrow, March 9, 2011 so I finally opened and started reading this book open last Sunday night. I am not really a Hawke’s fan. However, I liked him in Robin Williams-starrer Dead Poets Society (1989) where he played as one of the students and the first to stand up on the desk in the ending scene. Who can forget how he and the beautiful Julie Delphy talked endlessly but intelligently inside the train in Before Sunrise (1995) and again in Before Sunset (2004)? I also enjoyed watching him in the science-thriller Gattaca (1997) faking his inclusion in that training school where only people of superior genes live. However, what really caught my attention was when he sensitively read Fable of the Mermaid and the Drunks, one of Pablo Neruda’s featured poems in the movie soundtrack of Il Postino (The Postman) (1994). The young man has beautiful mind inside his equally beautiful head so it did not really come as a surprise when I saw that he has also authored two novels.Ash Wednesday is a gritty love story between an AWOL soldier,  Jimmy Heartsock and his girlfriend Christy. With his angst, Jimmy is half-Cauldfeld and with his Catholic beliefs, half-preacher. I thought I would like this character because it seems to be multi-dimensional but when I finally closed the book, it just did not make any imprint in my mind especially with the contrived ending where Jimmy decides to stay in the middle between the two obvious choices. The character of Christy makes more sense not only because she knows what she wants but once she makes a decision she goes for it no matter what the odds are. She does not vacillate unlike Jimmy who, despite being a military man, keeps on changing his mind, refuses to give up drugs, and goes fucking girls left and right. However, Hawke’s storytelling has a distinct style: straightforward, cocky yet sincere. It does leave you with a feeling that you are taken for another ride just like after closing and finishing a Nicholas Sparks book. It is not at all mushy like how love stories normally are. Some lines are with sprinklers of Hawke’s own brand of philosophical musings that proves his sensitivity and self-awareness as a person.

4327,Dreamland,Todd Schorr,4.56,45,2,Eisnein,5,"Eisnein's No.33 Favorite Artist/Artbook. Check Out No.34 Right HERE. Go Back to No.1 HERE.'Real men paint with oils' -- or so says the revered underground commix pioneer-turned-gallery artist and prime mover of Pop Surrealism -- Robert Williams. All due respect to 'Mr. Bitchin', but he needs to shut the fuck up. Setting aside the macho idiocy and implied chauvinism of this statement, Williams' assertion is that real artists embrace the difficult qualities and aesthetic rewards of oils, rejecting the quicker, easier, but more limited medium of acrylics. I tend to prefer artists who work with oils, watercolors and inks, due in part to the long and prestigious history stretching back to the Renaissance, to the genius of Campin, Jan Van Eyck & Rogier Van Der Weyden; Durer, Bosch & Bruegel; Giovanni Bellini, Titian & Caravaggio. But in the case of Todd Schorr, acrylic paint is really the perfect choice. It's a newer medium for painters that first gained popularity in the mid-20th century amongst illustrators working on strict deadlines. Oil takes much longer to dry, which has many benefits... unless you're doing a painting that has to be sompleted in 2 days. Since Todd Schorr's work is concerned entirely with the magnificent kitsch of 20th Century America -- classic horror and science fiction films from Grade A - Grade F, made-in-Taiwan mechanical toys, pre-code E.C.comic-books like 'Tales From the Crypt' and 'Weird Science', and the cartoons that are so much a part of childhood in the US -- Acrylics are the only choice. For his brand of epic pop-cultural surrealism - unpretentious, divorced from the historical tradition of oil painting -- the medium truly is the message. That said, Schorr famously manages levels of detail and realism with Acrylics that very few artists could match with oils.Todd Schorr is one the most influential and respected practitioners of Pop Surrealism (or 'HiLo', or 'Lowbrow', a name I hate). Only Williams and Mark Ryden have acheived similar levels of critical, popular & financial success. As one of many young painters who work primarily with acrylics, Schorr has provided a powerful argument for the possibilities of acrylics. 'Dreamland', one of the most stunningly gorgeous monograph's to be published by Last Gasp, a company with a long history of beautifully designed artbooks, includes many of his largest and most intricate canvases, a series of works in which each is dedicated to a specific pop cultural theme: Horror, Science Fiction, Cartoons, Comics... again, the complexity of his compositions and the level of detail he achieves is unmatched in contemporary art, demonstrating the intrinsic value and possibilities afforded by acrylic paint.At 11"" x 11"", 140 pages, this is a generous format that utilizes space as efficiently as possible. After a brief and interesting introduction, it's all about the art; on one page, the finished painting, on the facing page, Schorr provides sketches and preliminary paintings, sometimes with accompanying stories based on each work. The cover is a wraparound detail of one of his large homages, in this case the 'Cartoon Gods'. The front and back covers have no text at all; instead, the titles are stamped onto the translucent plastic slipcase, an extravagant touch that makes this monograph one of the best designs I've seen at this price-range. The fact that it features some of the most essential art produced in the last 20 years makes it a must-buy for artbook aficionados.Eisnein's No.33 Favorite Artist/Artbook. Check Out No.34 Right HERE.

6179,Auschwitz Report,Primo Levi,3.95,190,24,Praxedes,3,"I saw this book on a shelf and was immediately drawn to the subject. It contains a medical report on conditions in Auschwitz by a doctor and former inmate --clinical, objective, and to the point.It was interesting to read this death camp described in a calm and methodical manner, without the usual emphasis on the horrors and abuses. Although I welcomed this fresh perspective, I couldn't help but feel an eerie undercurrent as I read the work, treating this subject as a detached lab report divided by categories and timelines. One could say it was almost 'Nazi-esque'.Clearly not a definitive work on internment in German/Polish concentration camps, this title fills an interesting niche and should be a part of the ""Holocaust Canon""."
6178,If This Is a Man & The Truce,Primo Levi,4.54,10184,522,Paul Bryant,5,"“However this war may end, we have won the war against you. None of you will be left to bear witness, but even if someone were to survive, the world would not believe him. There will be perhaps suspicions, discussions, research by historians, but there will be no certainties, because we will destroy the evidence together with you. And even if some proof should remain and some of you survive, people will say that the events you describe are too monstrous to be believed – they will say they are the exaggerations of Allied propaganda and will believe us, who will deny everything, and not you.”This is such a stunning statement. Levi puts it into the mouth of a contemptuous SS officer speaking to a Jewish kapo some time in 1943. Reading it in the 1980s I was thinking well, at least Primo Levi and all the other great writers and historians have made sure that this greatest of horror stories has been documented and believed. Reading the same speech 20 years later, I'm not so sure. Now we have many people telling us well, you know, the Holocaust was just one amongst many - they happen all the time. Which is not so, and misunderstands, even from well-meaning motives. And tragically the Holocaust is inextricably bound into the DNA of the creation of the state of Israel, so that Israel is accused of using the Holocaust to prop up its own ultra-defensiveness and expansionism. (Remember the ""Eleventh Commandment"" : ""Thou shalt not grant Hitler any posthumous victories."")And so this infests the whole pro-Palestinian rhetoric which has a vile tendency to shade over towards Holocaust denial (our current but by no means only example being Ahmedinejad).Just another grand example of the hideous knots us human beings love to tie whilst living on a beautiful little planet on the edge of a galaxy, itself one of millions of others, spinning in the glistering vastness of this universe."
6176,The Drowned and the Saved,Primo Levi,4.37,3954,213,orsodimondo,5,"CAMPO DI ANNIENTAMENTO A prima vista la Shoa appare materia senza grigio, senza sfumature: il bianco delle vittime, il nero dei carnefici.Ma è anche materia delicata come un castello di carte, perché, come dimostra Primo Levi in questa breve magnifica ulteriore riflessione sull’argomento, la zona grigia esiste eccome: è quella piega ambigua dello sterminio, si annida in quella schiera di persone che ha subito l’ulteriore oltraggio di essere sporcata dal proprio aguzzino.È una zona grigia, dai contorni mal definiti, che insieme separa e congiunge i due campi dei padroni e dei servi.La vita nei Lager comportava una regressione, riconduceva a comportamenti selvaggi, trasformava anche la vittima in un essere primordiale, svincolato da ogni legame di solidarietà con i suoi simili. Una vischiosa ambiguità.Sono rimasto particolarmente colpito da quest’opera scritta da una vittima famosa del Lager: semplice, sintetica, lucida, profonda, acuminata, senza aggressività, senza odio… quasi come se Levi fosse uomo di fede.Ma non lo era, affatto.Come Jean Améry, sostiene che i credenti nel Lager vivevano meglio, erano accomunati dalla forza salvifica della loro fede, il loro universo era più vasto del nostro, più esteso nello spazio e nel tempo, soprattutto più comprensibile.Ma né Levi né Améry abbracciarono fede religiosa o politica.Una voce sobria nel tono e fatta di poche parole chiare, che si alza molto alta.Levi non si accontentò dei pur notevoli risultati della sua opera letteraria: questo libro, dopo quaranta anni di distanza da quegli avvenimenti, rimane a testimoniare il suo irriducibile tentativo di capire e di spiegare.Aggiunge aspetti importanti a un tema immenso.Sembra un sassolino, invece è un macigno.Sembra un testo di passaggio, invece è basilare, imprescindibile.Mi colpisce quanto Levi sia consapevole che l’Orrore possa ripetersi, quanto sia lucido sul fatto che per quanto fuori portata, la sua vicenda si rispecchia in vicende simili che lui stesso indica (la Cambogia è citata più volte).Ciò che è stato possibile perpetrare ieri, potrà essere nuovamente tentato domani, potrà coinvolgere noi stessi o i nostri figli. È avvenuto, quindi può accadere di nuovo.Era un uomo, ed è rimasto un uomo.Anche là dove molti si sono trasformati, o persi.I salvati, i superstiti, non sono i testimoni veri. Noi sopravvissuti siamo una minoranza anomala oltre che esigua: siamo quelli che, per loro prevaricazione o abilità o fortuna, non hanno toccato il fondo. Chi lo ha fatto, chi ha visto la Gorgone, non è tornato per raccontare, o è tornato muto; ma sono loro, i sommersi, i testimoni integrali, coloro la cui deposizione avrebbe avuto un significato generale. Loro sona la regola, noi l’eccezione. Primo Levi."
6174,Survival in Auschwitz,Primo Levi,4.28,33330,1227,João Pinto Coelho,5,"Levi ensinou-me que as histórias do Holocausto terminam sempre com perguntas. E, sim, é bárbaro escrever Poesia depois de Auschwitz; mas vejam: é possível! Costumo pegar neste excerto e dizer ao mundo o quanto gostava de ter sido eu a escrevê-lo:“E veio a noite, e foi uma noite tal, que se sabe que olhos humanos não deveriam assistir e sobreviver. Todos sentiram isso: nenhum dos guardas, quer italianos, quer alemães, teve a coragem de vir ver que coisas fazem os homens quando sabem que vão morrer. Cada um se despediu da vida da maneira que melhor sabia. Alguns rezaram, outros beberam além da conta, outros inebriaram-se numa nefasta e última paixão. Mas as mães mantiveram-se acordadas e prepararam, com cuidado amoroso, o alimento para a viagem, lavaram os seus meninos e prepararam as bagagens; ao raiar do dia, o arame farpado estava cheio de roupas de criança estendidas ao vento, a secar; e não esqueceram as fraldas, e os brinquedos, e os travesseiros, e centenas de outras pequenas coisas das quais as crianças sempre necessitam. Não fariam também vocês a mesma coisa? Se fossem morrer amanhã com os vossos filhos, não lhes dariam hoje de comer?”"
6173,The Periodic Table,Primo Levi,4.2,7390,592,Petra Eggs,5,"In an interweaving between the elements and stories, Primo Levi tells his life. But he chooses episodes to relate carefully and never discusses his children. At the end he tells us, that his writing was only """"partial and symbolic"". The man who wrote so much and so tellingly of Auschwitz in If This Is a Man remains a mystery.The greatest mystery of all, to me, was his death. At 67 he fell over the balustrade of the stairs down from the 3rd floor of the house he'd lived in all his life (except when he was imprisoned in Auschwitz). How do you fall over a stair rail? Was it suicide? Was he the last victim of the concentration camps?"
2908,"Bleach (""Si Shen"") (Volume 1)",Tite Kubo,4.21,122822,933,Laurel,5,"This manga series is absolutely amazing! Anyone considering whether or not to read this manga, read it now! And for those of you currently reading the series but not yet finished with all the books, you will be blown away by Tite Kubo's advancement in skill! The beginning of bleach has amazing artwork, and at the end there's such an incredible improvement in the way he draws the characters... Even when I thought (after reading the first book) there was no room for Tite Kubo to improve, since he was already such an amazing mangaka. The storyline is truly amazing (and still ongoing, might I add) and blew me away! And, even though I don't usually dwell on things like clothes, the clothes are absolutely amazing! All the different designs he's thought up... In all previous mangas I've read, the mangaka will stick to a few sets of outfits for his characters to wear, but Tite Kubo goes all out! Especially in the filler sketches... I feel as if I am rambling, but the point is, this is a truly amazing manga, and that it should be read right away!"
6066,Robinson Crusoe,Daniel Defoe,3.66,199272,4727,Melissa,1,"This is one of those books that really serves to remind a modern audience of why we should kill whitey. Robinson Crusoe is the story of a young man with atrociously bad luck who, unfortunately for any shipmates he ever has, suffers from an extreme case of wanderlust. Every ship he gets onto sinks, but he just keeps getting onto them. Even after he's got a nice, successful plantation of his own, he decides he's just GOT to get on ANOTHER ship to -- get this -- procure himself some slaves. It crashes of course, and he gets stranded alone on an island. Not to worry, though -- he's got a bible, and he successfully becomes a religious zealot while alone with nothing better to do. It's too bad that his only book couldn't have been a copy of Don Quixote or something because maybe then he'd have become a more interesting storyteller. But no, like so many people who have terrible luck, he turns to ""god"" and starts counting his ""blessings,"" more-or-less out of a lack of anything better to do. Then, after he's been alone for 24 years, he sees a footprint in the sand, and he totally freaks, and he becomes convinced it must belong to the devil. Ummm, ok. So I'm sitting there thinking, ""Maybe it's your own footprint."" But it takes this genius a whole day of scaring himself before he comes up with that explanation. Anyway, it turns out not to be his footprint at all, it actually belongs to the ""savages"" (Carribean Indians) who apparently visit the island sometimes in order to cook and eat their prisoners, which, for the record, was not actually a common practice among Indians in the Americas. And here's the part where you really hate white people. He then saves one of the prisoners from being eaten and makes him into his slave, who he renames ""Friday,"" teaches English, and converts to Christianity. Friday, instead of kicking this pompous jerk's posterior from here to next Friday after repaying whatever debt he owed Robinson for saving his life, is a faithful slave in every way for the remainder of the book. Friday speaks in a pidgin English, which is probably realistic enough for a man who learned English late in life from one solitary individual, but Robinson has an offensive habit of translating easy-enough-to-understand things that Friday says to us, the idiot readers (""At which he smiled, and said - 'Yes, yes, we always fight the better;' that is, he meant always get the better in fight""). Also, during Friday's religious education, he asks Robinson why god doesn't just kill the devil and end evil, and because there is actually no good answer to such a question for a religious person, Robinson simply pretends not to hear him and wanders away. What a jack*ss! Luckily, Robinson Crusoe's religious conversion doesn't last forever. As soon as he's back in civilization and making money hand over fist, he pretty much gives it up. Speaking of which, what was with the end of this book? He gets rescued, he goes home, but there's no emotional payoff, and instead he goes on about his European adventures with Friday. We don't care about the wolves and dancing bear! We want to know, did you learn anything from your years away? Do you feel like you missed out? Was anyone happy to see you? Did they have a funeral for you while you were missing? What did your mother do when she saw you again? Robinson Crusoe is a man without any of the human characteristics that make people interesting to read about when they get into difficult situations. He has no regrets, no personal longings, and he never reflects on his life before he was on the island during his decades on the island. I understand that this is just an ""adventure novel"" but people actually still read this tripe and consider it a classic!"
4764,Soul of the Sword : An Illustrated History of Weaponry and Warfare from Prehistory to the Present,Robert L. O'Connell,4.14,36,5,Miloș Dumbraci,5,"Both the title ”Soul of the sword” and the subtitle ”Illustrated history of weaponry and warfare” are misleading; there is very little about swords, a history of weaponry it is not so much (many famous ones are missing and the technological view is underused), illustrated - almost not at all. But a history of warfare it is, and an excellent one, explaining the mechanisms by which war appeared and evolved, and especially the societal ”why?”s for every era.Even better, the book finds the golden spot between too much and too little science, offering the perfect amount of history, sociology and psychology to be both captivating and educational.Highly recommended (for readers well aquainted with history)."
5140,The Devil Wears Prada,Lauren Weisberger,3.7,686303,8072,Darth J ,3,"3.5 starsIn Defense of Miranda PriestlyThe premise of this novel as most know it is OMG, my boss is a total dragon lady!!!, but I think that is both an unfair assumption and oversimplification. Little background is given of the title character other than she grew up in a lower class family, changed her name, and worked her way up the corporate ladder to her current position as editor-in-chief. The audience isn’t given much more than that to round out her character, though Meryl Streep gives her depth in the movie adaptation—which isn’t saying much since Streep could star in the biography of a paper bag and still win an Oscar. #QueenInstead, we see Anna Wintour Miranda Priestly through the doe eyes of Andrea “Andy” Sachs, who doesn’t realize that perhaps she is the real antagonist of the novel. Through her own confession she has no clue about the company nor her potential boss when she takes on the role of Miranda’s 2nd assistant, nor does she seem to really care. While her coworkers at Runway are said to be vapid and stuck up, they have a much better work ethic than the lazy Andy who complains about every part of her job (except all the perks, of which there are plenty). She is ungrateful for the experience and the contacts she gains while doing Miranda’s errands, instead she focuses on moaning about having to actually earn her dues. I see her as an unreliable narrator since nearly all of her commentary comes from the place of entitlement.Priestly is cast as the villain because she is difficult and demands efficiency, though one could argue that this book wouldn’t be given nearly the mileage or popularity if the accusations hurled against her were by a male main character instead of speshul snowflake Andy. There is a trope in modern culture that women in leadership positions have to fight double standards for acting the same way as their male counterparts, and this is never touched upon in the novel. Can Miranda be cold and condescending at times? Yes, however it is important to understand how much she has accomplished, her worth to the magazine and the fashion world, and the respect she has garnered in the industry. She wouldn’t have gotten where she was if she didn’t have talent and gumption.If there’s an unlikeable character here, it’s unappreciative Andy who doesn’t like that she has to live outside the bubble she grew up in. While she keeps being reminded that hers is a job that “a million girls would die for” and that working for Miranda for a year would save her 3-5 years of experience elsewhere, she decides to blow up at her boss in the 11th hour. While the author was probably looking for the audience to cheer at the childish outburst of “Fuck you, Miranda. Fuck you.” (p. 342) and the resulting flouncing from Paris, I found this tantrum to be déclassé and further proof of Andy’s wanton unprofessionalism."

5148,A Separate Peace,John Knowles,3.56,163652,5658,Jeffrey Keeten,5,"""And the rays of the sun were shooting past them, millions of rays shooting past them like--like golden machine-gun fire.""Gene is a boy from the South attending an exclusive New Hampshire prep school. He becomes best friends with a New Englander from Boston named Phineas. Let me amend that, Phineas chooses Gene as his friend and any thoughts that Gene has of being friends with anyone else are quickly dispersed as he is pulled into the shimmering chimeric world creating and constantly maintained by Phineas.""The winter loves me,"" he retorted, and then, disliking the whimsical sound of that, added, ""I mean as much as you can say a season can love> What I mean is, I love winter, and when you really love something, then it loves you back, in whatever way it has to love."" I didn't think that this was true, my seventeen years of experience had shown this to be much more false than true, but it was like every other thought and belief of Finny's: it should have been true. So I didn't argue.Gene, maybe because he is going to school with boys from New England who have the advantage of generations of proper schooling drilled into their DNA, feels the insecurity of his origins acutely and feels the pressure to apply himself to his studies. In fact he is in contention for the top of class until Phineas's antics start to distract him too much from his academic endeavors. Phineas is a prophet, a boy so convinced in his own convictions that he can persuade anyone to not only do anything, but also believe in why they are doing it. One such inspired creation was to convince his friends to follow him onto a slender tree limb and use it as a springboard into the lake. He forms a society around the event. To join, one must take the plunge. Phineas is a fine athlete and as Gene starts to weigh their relationship he starts to believe that Finny is intentionally pulling him away from his study to keep the scales of friendship out of balance. He feels his academic record compensates for Phineas's awards for athleticism. He wants to feel equal. He wants to deserve the friendship. When Phineas pulls him away from his French studies to attend a now ritualized lake baptism, Gene goes, but his mind is in a dark place. The results are a turning point in the book. Gene is so worried about his own insecurities he mistakes Phineas's confidence for worldly assurance. In reality, Phineas is the most naive of them all. In the enclosed environment of Devon School he can bend the world to fit his own kaleidoscopic. For a while he can even convince himself that the ongoing war is a hoax. ""That's what this whole war story is. A medicinal drug...the whole world is on a Funny Farm now. But it's only the fat old men who get the joke. And Phineas of course.Betrayal begets more betrayal and Gene and Phineas both discover they are not who they perceive themselves to be. They become straw versions of themselves, so shattered and shaken that they can barely remember joys experienced mere months before. A lifetime friendship is reduced to a fraction of it's intended span. This book stands on the shoulders of Phineas. He is simply an amazing character who lifts a wallflower of a plot to the level of a masterpiece. I wanted to be his friend. I wanted to help him maintain his delusions. I wanted to breath life into the way he wanted the world to be.

There is a trope in modern culture that women in leadership positions have to fight double standards for acting the same way as their male counterparts, and this is never touched upon in the novel. Can Miranda be cold and condescending at times? Yes, however it is important to understand how much she has accomplished, her worth to the magazine and the fashion world, and the respect she has garnered in the industry. She wouldn’t have gotten where she was if she didn’t have talent and gumption.If there’s an unlikeable character here, it’s unappreciative Andy who doesn’t like that she has to live outside the bubble she grew up in. While she keeps being reminded that hers is a job that “a million girls would die for” and that working for Miranda for a year would save her 3-5 years of experience elsewhere, she decides to blow up at her boss in the 11th hour. While the author was probably looking for the audience to cheer at the childish outburst of “Fuck you, Miranda. Fuck you.” (p. 342) and the resulting flouncing from Paris, I found this tantrum to be déclassé and further proof of Andy’s wanton unprofessionalism."

9493,"A Time to Embrace: Same-Gender Relationships in Religion, Law, and Politics",William Stacy Johnson,4.2,59,12,Robert D. Cornwall,5,"There has been a plethora of great books written of late on the question of same-gender relationships -- both in society and the church. Some like those of Jeff Chu and Justin Lee are wonderfully written conversations that speak from experience. William Stacy Johnson's book, now in its second edition, is perhaps the most helpful book of all. He writes of theology, scripture, and the law. He shares with us the spectrum of views and offers an alternative -- consecration -- that I believe holds the key to the future of the church's understanding of marriage, sexuality, and covenant relationship. To top all of this off, he adds in his legal interpretation based on his own legal training. It's a deep book -- not a fast read. It covers a lot of ground. But how I wish I'd read the 1st edition when it came to me years ago and the second edition when it arrived about a year ago. In any case -- this is a powerful book and a must read for all who desire to live out the gospel in this age!"
9494,The Divine Embrace: Recovering the Passionate Spiritual Life,Robert E. Webber,4.33,82,8,Paul,5,"This book describes very well the form of spirituality that I want to live out in my life. Easier said than done. The first part of the book describes the history of the Christian Church and its loss of the spiritual vitality that characterized it in its early stages. This loss is still evident today in our cultural surroundings and in the way nearly all churches function in varying ways and degrees. Spirituality has tended to become self-focused, instead of God-focused, making God the object of human knowledge and experience.	The second half of the book outlines a reorientation of Christian Spirituality for the future that is faithful to ancient Christian scriptural teaching and practice. It's an outline that few churches today fill in with substantive detail, but one that I think is vital to the distinctive work and witness of Christianity in the world. Robert Webber's vision is being carried out after his death by the Ancient-Future Faith Network. It's my fervent hope that it grows tremendously."
1575,Four Major Plays: Lysistrata/The Birds/The Clouds/The Acharnians,Aristophanes,3.68,19,1,V,4,"Lysistrata: In this Greek comedy, Aristophanes's timeless wit displays the ingenuity of women and men's dependence on women.The Birds: This next comedy from Aristophanes in the publication laughs at the (successful) attempt of two men to set up a city of birds in the air. As they present their scheme to the birds, they are almost torn to pieces, but the flighty birds quickly change their impressions of the men. Then, once the city in the air has been constructed, one of the men is quickly crowned king and must deal with a number of human and godly visitors to his city. His response to the humans is to beat them, while his response to the gods is to make demands of them. Overall, this is an absurd and enjoyable play, although making a mockery of what it takes to run a kingdom.The Clouds: Aristophanes's contempt for Socrates and his philosophy is evident in this play where he makes a mockery of higher thought. An interesting companion to Socratic philosophy, this text gives insight to its contemporary opponents."
9492,Sunset Embrace,Sandra Brown,3.95,3329,130,Duchess Nicole,1,"DNF-ing at about 65%.POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!! Don't read on unless you want the details.I read this book in the past and remember liking it, although I do recall that the hero was a standout jerk at first. Upon this reread, I confirmed my earlier thoughts but honestly, he went way beyond jerk territory into complete asshole. The premise is already an uncomfortable one at the beginning. In the opening scene, Lydia is giving birth to a stillborn baby conceived through rape via her stepbrother. She's ready to die and okay with the fact that the baby is dead. A couple of boys from a passing wagon train stumble upon her and the baby, and their ma and pa take her in. Coincidentally, Ross Coleman's wife dies in labor a few days later and Lydia is needed as a milk cow to keep the baby alive. Ross is an unbelievable ass. I understand that he is grieving, but the way he treats others says so much about him. Lydia is dealing with a horrific past and a shaky, scary present, and yet she maintains her dignity and poise. Ross just turns into a mean, nasty person. He loves calling her a whore, treating her like a second class citizen, making her feel like a burden to him, and constantly letting her know how she could never measure up to his dead wife. The cherry on the top of his degradation of Lydia is when he rapes her...literally holds her down, bruises her wrists, fucks her raw, and does this while she's screaming and crying out in pain, begging him to stop. There's no forced seduction here, nothing titillating or pleasing about this encounter. And yet somehow, when Lydia...who has never known sex to be anything but rape...thinks about this encounter the next day with tenderness and longing. What the actual fuck? This is the point where I lose interest in the story, because no matter what happens from here on out, I can't get past the rape, and I can't imagine a woman who is brutalized that way romanticizing it the very next day. I know sometimes I enjoy stories with forced seduction and scenes that ride fine line between that and rape. I have no excuses except that often there are subtleties that influence my opinion, and I don't feel the need to make excuses for my preferences. They are what they are Seeing as how I'm a romance reader and let's face it...romance is often predictable...I'm fairly certain I know how the book will play out. But I'm listening to the audiobook, and still have something like four or five hours to go before the end. I'm just not interested in investing that much more time in it."

4404,American Gods,Neil Gaiman,4.11,534178,28579,Stacey,5,"In 2003, I walked away from my childhood religion – a high control (some would say abusive) group with a tiny little worldview and a severe superiority complex. This was my reality:I believed with all my being that the things depicted above were real, and were just over the event horizon. Leaving meant losing almost every friend I had ever made since childhood, it created a rift with my still devout family, and quite possibly saved my life. Is it any wonder that fiction – alternate realities, fantasy, and mental escape – helped me make that decision, helped me move on, and helped deprogram my cult-think? One fiction supplanted the other, only this time I already knew I was working with stories. Some of this fiction I had read many times, not understanding why the stories resonated so strongly within me, just knowing that I was compelled to return to those worlds, over and over. Others were stories I read during the time surrounding my breakaway, and shortly thereafter.*American Gods made me observe and think differently. It gave me a new context for the mythologies I had accepted for most of my life. It was bigger than the story of Shadow, or the girl Sam, or Czernabog. For me, it was about how we allow our Old Gods to define our present worldview, and how we allow our New Gods to steal our awareness. Our mythologies set the boundaries of our culture, and paradoxically, as our culture changes, our gods sacrifice their immortality.  ""Religions are, by definition, metaphors, after all: God is a dream, a hope, a woman, an ironist, a father, a city, a house of many rooms, a watchmaker who left his prize chronometer in the desert, someone who loves you--even, perhaps, against all evidence, a celestial being whose only interest is to make sure your football team, army, business, or marriage thrives, prospers, and triumphs over all opposition.""The part of the story that affected me the most profoundly was the story of Hinzelmann and Lakeside. The mixing of good and evil, the blurring of lines, townspeople looking the other way – to such a degree that it never occurs to them to see what is happening right under their noses. Dead men's bones. Deaths of legends. It affected me to my core. During the time I was reading American Gods, it was this which rocked me – I was doing the same thing – choosing and keeping and killing my own Gods, my own mythologies. It was tremendously painful, made a little easier by having the opportunity to process it within the bounds of somebody else's story.*The rest of the list:DuneChapterhouse DuneFahrenheit 451Animal Farm1984SandmanCrisis of ConscienceUnder the Banner of HeavenSeductive Poison"

4464,My Dear Watson: Being the Annals of Sherlock Holmes,David L. Hammer,3.5,4,1,Nadine,3,"If you don't mind the premise that Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are one and the same, that Holmes is a Canadian and lived in Germany (though to be fair all of those points don't feature in the stories at all) and if you also like very short stories you will enjoy this book.I would have given it two stars but the very last story was rather good and the stories are all very well written.

4405,"American Gospel: God, the Founding Fathers, and the Making of a Nation",Jon Meacham,3.77,1709,242,Matt,4,"""In God We Trust"", the official motto of the United States of America, emblazoned on places as important as the Supreme Court and as basic as an off-colour Lincoln penny. That simple, but powerful, sentiment fuels Meacham's exploration of the basis of religion in America, offset by the Founding Fathers' constitutionally entrenched separation of Church and State. By no means was this division as longstanding as the presence of people in the original colonies, for the early residents had fled England because of religious persecution and organised their settlements with a strong set of Christian beliefs. Meacham tackles discussions by those who attended the Constitutional Conventions, where early ideas of religion and faith within the new America proved somewhat divisive. Some wanted to entrench Christianity in their new country, as it was imbued in all laws and proved to be largely practiced throughout the Thirteen Colonies. However, Thomas Jefferson argued strongly that the country should be a more inclusive and less entrenched nation, possibly tied to his less than stalwart views on a Higher Being. The Founding Fathers knew that the country they sought to create would be one built on tolerance and, while not ridding the state of Christianity, ensured religious openness with the Bill of Rights and the First Amendment. Meacham explores how Washington steered the state through its early years, balancing on this precarious thread, which proved successful. Other presidents handled the religious debate with less aplomb, outwardly espousing the Christian God to save them in their time of need. Of greatest interest is Meacham's exploration of the three presidents who saw America through the tumultuous war years. Lincoln, whose various speeches sought to steer away from seeking God's blessing and sought instead to place his trust that the 'right' answer would come to pass. Woodrow Wilson and FDR took a more preacher-cum-president approach, seeking Americans to pray for success over their foes and vilifying those who did not fall into line or spoke out against these pleas to the Christian God. One might extrapolate this and look to Bush 43, whose fabrication of facts and declaration of a War on Terror bred xenophobia and a degree of Islamaphobia that still simmers to this day. The American State also had periods where public sentiment clashed with the inherent beliefs of some religious groups, namely acceptance of abortion and the ongoing debate over capital punishment. Meacham effectively argues that America weathered this storm and its leaders, while sometimes left to grit their teeth, never lashed out against all that was going on. These personal beliefs did not bring the country to its knees, nor did it create chaos amongst the masses, some of whom would not have worshiped the same God as their leaders. Meacham looks to the latter part of his book to explore public religion, which differs greatly from the personal tenets that Americans held in their hearts. Acknowledgement of religious holidays (Christmas and Easter), as well as the Judeo-Christian set of legal beliefs are two strong examples of this. These public ideals remove the neutrality that would be required for a complete separation between Church and State, though it does not adversely affect the citizenry, at least to the point of any violation of certain beliefs. This might seem like a minor point, but Meacham makes it nonetheless, wishing to keep all discussions aboveboard. Worthy of a brief mention, Meacham does touch on the judicial branch, which acted as a shepherd in guiding the state through some of its more trying times, ensuing that the First Amendment's freedoms were never curtailed, but that there was a balance to ensure the greatest cross-section of the population could live free from intrusion. While religion and the state remains a highly divisive issue and one that can spark many concerns, Meacham come to the conclusion that America's personal gospel is one of acceptance and openness, even when its leaders may seek to push the envelop and subtly turn the country into an 'us' versus 'them' battle. This is by no means a simple topic to digest, though Meacham has done a brilliant job in educating the masses. Having recently completed a book that explored the depths of the First Amendment, I thought it a good idea to take some time to explore this topic. Meacham does a fabulous job in laying out his arguments clearly, with strong examples pulled from history, documents, and documented reports. He takes the entirety of the American political experience and focusses the Church versus State argument through the various political eras without weighing things down with too much information. Meacham's primary argument or freedom and acceptance flows throughout, while offsetting this with an equally compelling belief that one would have to live under a rock not to see the long-standing Christian values that shine through all laws and speeches made by political leaders. With two hundred and forty years of experience, America's views have held firm, though history has tossed enough tests into its path to force a few course corrections. But, as with any belief system, a reevaluation is always useful to match the flavour of the times.Kudos, Mr. Meacham for another stellar political analysis. I wish I could do your work justice with my review. You take on so much and yet make it seem so effortless.Like/hate the review?

9103,Mandela: The Authorized Portrait,Mac Maharaj,4.27,118,10,Melissa Westbrook,4,"I am currently visiting South Africa and after booking a day tour to Soweto and the Apartheid museum I picked up the updated version of this (following his 90th birthday a few years ago) along with ""Long Walk to Freedom"". This book was excellent for orienting myself in preparation for the places mentioned in it that I was to visit the next day. I was infinitely more knowledgable about all the events outlined on the tour as a result, such as the significance of Mandela's home in Soweto (which I then visited), his tribal heritage, the complicated relationship he had with his second wife Winnie, who still lives in Soweto (we were shown her house). Mac Maharaj had a close relationship with Mandela from his time in prison and the updated version has really quite definitive accounts of the interpersonal relationships people who knew him had over the years, from his law firm secretaries as a young lawyer and activist to those from much later in his life such as Bono from U2. An all-encompassing, politely honest but unexposing and non-scandalous grounding of the significance of Nelson Mandela in African and indeed international politics."
9102,The Crimson Portrait,Jody Shields,2.75,388,81,Beverly,4,"It's 1915 and Catherine finds herself like one of many women, a young widow. Heartbroken and lost, she decides to honor her late husbands wishes to allow the troops to use their beautiful, sprawling mansion as a make-shift hospital. Little does she know how much her decision will change the rest of her life. As she watches her home become an absence of her former life, she slowly finds herself grasping for comfort in the dream of her dead husband. As she begins to take part in helping at the hospital that was formerly her home, she sees a chance at literally being able to recreate her dead husband's image in a soldier who must undergo surgeries to restore his face. She finds herself torn between making the choice that will forever change not only her life, but the life of Julian, a young soldier who is having his face reconstructed after losing it in battle. Will she make the right choice? And will she be able to live with the choice she's made? Deep and intricate webs of deception begin to be woven as not only Catherine deals with her decision to betray the young man his right to recreating his own face again but as Anna, the artist who creates drawings of the soldiers, feels a sense of loneliness as her own husband is off in battle. Will Anna allow her feelings for a foreign doctor take her over or will she continue to try to ignore her feelings? Secrets kept amongst themselves, the doctors all seem to have something to hide that creates an inner turmoil within each of them. As they triumph in huge leaps in the area of reconstructive surgery, an area formerly left untouched by 'modern medicine', they suffer huge setbacks as their minds are dealt with images of horror every day as they repair young soldiers from the front. Shields creates characters of such depth that you realize you may never complete unpeeling their layers as you find more and more out about them throughout the novel. As your heart aches for all involved, you will find yourself questioning how strong you could be in a situation similar and learn to love each and every one of the characters, despite their flaws. An excellent story line that reads so easily you will find you've finished reading long before you're ready to close the book. With characters of such depth and reality you will continue to wonder where they went with their lives even after you close the pages. Absolutely awesome! You will want more!"
9106,"Portrait in Death (In Death, #16)",J.D. Robb,4.37,27101,637,Phrynne,5,"J.D. Robb at her best!There are so many totally emotional scenes between Roarke, who is definitely not at his perfect best, and Eve, who steps up to be the best wife she can. Tissues anyone?Then there are all the in jokes like hidden chocolate bars and Eve's twitchy eye whenever Peabody puts the words sex and McNab into the same sentence.Of course there is the usual banter. Peabody and Eve get most of the good lines in this one, although everyone is a comedian from time to time. And don't forget the drama. Trueheart plays an important role towards the end as the book rushes to a stressful conclusion.Finally a special commendation to Galahad who plays one of his biggest roles even though it has serious consequences for Summerset.So good:)"

1989,Great Expectations,Charles Dickens,3.75,513841,12479,Michael Kneeland,5,"My students (and some of my friends) can't ever figure out why I love this novel so much. I explain how the characters are thoroughly original and yet timeless, how the symbolism is rich and tasty, and how the narrative itself is juicy and chock-full of complexity, but they just shake their heads at me in utter amazement and say, ""What's wrong with you, dude?""What's wrong, indeed.I give them ten or fifteen years. Perhaps they'll have to read it again in college, or maybe they'll just try reading it again as an adult to see if they can try to figure out why it's such a ""classic,"" but after some time has passed from their initial encounter with the novel, they will find that I am not so crazy after all and that the book is in fact one of the best examples--if not the best example--of the novel. This happens to me all the time: I will re-read something I was forced to read in middle school and high school, remembering how much I hated it then, and will find that I actually love it now, as an adult. Sure, those ""classics"" may have taught me something about literary analysis, symbolic patterns, and the like, but I couldn't appreciate it for its complexity until I was older. I guess the rule of wine appreciation applies here, too: good taste only comes after much patience and experience.***Perhaps the thing I love best about this novel is the cast of characters--their names as well as their personalities. Ms. Havisham is one of my favorite characters to ever appear in all of the literature I have read. There is so much density and complexion to her character that I could literally make an entire career out of writing discourses on her characterization. She has even invaded the way I think about the world and the people I have met: I have, for instance, started referring to those instances where parents try to achieve success through their children ""the Havisham effect"" (unfortunately, you see this all too often in the world of teaching). Havisham's name is another exasperatingly fantastic aspect of her character: like the majority of Dickens' characters, you pretty much know what you're in for when you first read her name--she is full of lies, tricks, and deceits (or ""sham""s). You don't get this sort of characterization much of anywhere else in the literary scene.Another reason I love this novel so much is its plotting. Remember, Dickens was writing in a serialized format so he needed to keep his readers hooked so that they'd want to buy the next issue of his periodical, All the Year Round, in order to see what happens next. Thus, the plot of Great Expectations is winding, unpredictable, and quite shocking at points. Certainly, in terms of heavy action--well, what our youngsters these days would call action, fighting and big explosions and what-not--there is none, or very little at most, but that's not the thing to be looking for. Figure out the characters first, and then, once you've gotten to know and even care for them (or hate them), you will be hooked on the plot because you will want to know what happens to these people who you've invested so much feeling into. This is, of course, true of all novels, but it's what I tell my students when they read Great Expectations for the first time, and by gum, it's helped more than a few of them get through the novel successfully.So, if you read Great Expectations in middle school, high school, or college, but haven't picked it up since, I urge you to do so. With a more patient and experienced set of eyes, you just might surprise yourself."
2025,Lysistrata (Clarendon),Aristophanes,3.84,28738,664,Seth,1,"I hate this book because I got arrested on account of it. I was at the University of Texas' Perry Castaneda Library and it got lost amidst the shuffled stack of books which I dumped into my backpack when I left. Exiting the library the sensor went off.Sorry, I forgot to check it out. No big deal, happens all the time. But the Department of Collegiate Fascism, aka the UTPD, are required to file a report. Bored from arresting 19-year-olds for walking down the street half drunk they show up like it's the scene of a hostage crisis. And, unlucky me, it turns out I have a warrant for an unpaid alcohol-possession ticket. Still, no big deal. I can go down to the station and pay it. Fine. But this is the lobby of a large student library and I am surrounded by my fellow students, all of us dutifully studying on a Tuesday night. As such, might I please just walk out to the police car?GET AGAINST THE WALL MOTHERFUCKER!A.J. COVER ME WHILE I SEARCH THIS SCUMBAG!GOTCHA COVERED BUDDY! [Loudly cocks shotgun]NO WEAPONS ON HIS TORSO! NOTHING UP HIS SPHINCTER! NOTHING TIED TO HIS BALLSACK... BUT WAIT, LET ME SQUEEZE HARDER! [Sound of testes being crunched by human fist]OK THIS PERP'S CLEAN! GIT ME MY CUFFS![Sound of me being viciously shackled]YOU GIT THAT ARM! HELP ME DRAG 'EM OUT TO THE SQUAD CAR! HOLD ON! HE'S MEEKLY PROTESTING! HAND ME MY BLUDGEON! [Egregious violence]YEAH! GIT SOME! GIT SOME! GIT SOME MOTHERFUCKER! YEAH A.J. KICK 'EM SOME MORE! GIT SOME, BITCH! Ok he ain't movin'. [Sound of manacled body being dragged across library lobby, accompanied by the stunned silence of onlookers]Thus ended my experience with Lysistrata. I never got to the ending, although in later years my various girlfriends, in the manner of Ghandi protesting English oppression of the Indian subcontinent, were wont to use ""Lysistratan nonaction"" to protest my rampant drinking and proneness to random street violence.Not recommended."
1988,Charles Dickens,Jane Smiley,3.8,487,86,Teresa,5,"4.75I initially dismissed this book due to its slim size, thinking it couldn’t possibly hold anything new for me and that certainly it must be a potted biography (a great phrase I’ve seen my British friends use). But then remembering how I’d enjoyed Carol Shields’ take on Jane Austen in the same Penguin Lives series (and also realizing how nice the book would look on my shelf, sans dust cover), I ordered a copy. As with Shield’s Jane Austen, a fellow novelist has insights a biographer likely would not and I ended up enjoying this book immensely.Smiley references the biography by John Forster, Dickens’ friend and first biographer, and the detailed biography by Peter Ackroyd, along with the Claire Tomalin biography of Ellen Ternan, always making clear what is speculation on anyone’s part and not of the historical record. (This was written before publication of the last volumes of Dickens’ letters and the more recent biography by Michael Slater, which I have yet to read.) Her insights range from the young Dickens feeling he was his parents’ lodger (à la  little David with the Micawbers); that the seemingly coincidental web of relationships within his novels are thematically intentional; that Dickens didn’t fit in, ever; that even in his later years he grew as a novelist (something he doesn’t always get credit for), including his female characterizations; and that in several, almost eerie, ways he presaged modernity.For anyone who wants a biography of Dickens without having to wade through the in-depth details of lengthier ones, I can’t recommend this more highly. It also doesn’t hurt that I agree with Smiley on her assessments of the best of Dickens’ novels, along with her critique of flaws in others that are more widely praised."
9929,From Babylon to Timbuktu: A History of the Ancient Black Races Including the Black Hebrews,Rudolph R. Windsor,4.34,249,23,Rosey D,3,"If you are one who is interested in cultural issues, historic issues, or have a deep sense of intuition this book is for you! Babylon to Timbuktu contains a vast wealth of historic knowledge that is very valuable particularly to persons of color. However, this also makes for a no-so easy read, as much of the information is confusing unless you have prior knowledge or studies in history. For the novice reader, this book will take time to reader with a thorough overview and research of the material provided. IT IS NOT A PAGE TURNER. While I found the book very useful, I also found it kind of difficult to read and keep up with the thoughts/info the writer provided. This difficulty may be a turn off for some, but if you have the interest and patience to read you will enjoy this book.Because this book was not an easy read, and the thoughts of the writer did not always flow- I gave this book 3 starts. In terms of quality though, this book is a five star read!"

It won't work.Capote: Why, Bob, I don't know what you mean! (In a whining tone)Linscott: Look. Bennett's getting nervous. It's been two years since Other Voices, Other Rooms came out. That jacket photo just about made us all laughing stocks.Capote: Now, that was perfectly innocent, Bob. And, Foxy, you had final approval on that picture. Now, didn't you?Linscott: You caught me at a weak moment.Capote: (Waving his cigarette delicately) Well, there you have it, Bobby.Linscott: We've kept you in front of the public, Truman. We published your short fiction inA Tree of Night: And Other Stories. But you've been promising...Capote: And it was a ROUSING success. You were at the reading down at the Poetry Center.

I'm working on something else. Something from back in Alabama. About growing up with Callie, Sook, and Annie.Linscott: Is this true? I want to see the first two chapters.Capote: Oh, Bob! You won't believe it. It's about the lovely years I spent with my cousins. I know how dark and gloomy Other Voices, Other Rooms was. But this is the HAPPY TC.

Callie always was the richest, meanest woman in town.Linscott: So, they run off from home and find a treehouse between two China Berry trees and live there, and Verena sends the law to bring them back, and there's this retired Judge--Capote--Charlie Cool who falls in love with Dolly, and Catherine Creek, Dolly's helper, and Riley, an older boy I looked up to all living up in this tree. And Judge Cool stands between Verena, the law and the townspeople who are trying to get Dolly to go back home and live with Verena.Linscott: My boy, my boy--This is simply marvelous stuff. How are you going to get them down out of the tree? ARE you going to get them out of the tree?Capote: Bob, you'll just have to wait and see. I'm mailing out the last sections June 4.Linscott: I hope you mean June 4, 1951, and not 52 or 53.Capote: Really Bob. You need to loosen up a little.

I do hope you are pleased with the book.Linscott: Uhm, how can I say this, Truman. I didn't like the ending. Nobody hear at Random House liked the ending.
  And if Bennett Cerf isn't happy, ain't nobody happy at Random HouseCapote: But, Bob, WHY? I just don't understand! (plaintively, turning into a pouty face)Linscott: Well, Truman, the first half was absolutely divine! I was expecting a continuing miracle! I don't think we got that. Not at all. Capote: But, but, but...Linscott: Not, you understand, that it isn't a good as a story and as superb as a piece of righting. There's no specific criticism to be made; just that we all had a slight feeling of letdown, tapering off a little, with the ending coming to soon. It's so short, we don't think people will buy it as a novel.Capote: I cannot endure it (stamping feet) that all of you think my book a failure. I am simply striken by such overpowering opinion!Linscott: ""We'll pray that the critics won't have the same feeling of vague letdown in the last half that effected us.SCENE FOUR: Review pages swirl coming to rest on headlines as a back drop to Truman Capote sitting in a comfortable chair.

9838,The Bookseller of Kabul,Åsne Seierstad,3.76,34272,2703,Ariel,1,"I was irritated early on by the way this book was written. I think it encompasses all my other grips about the book.Basically the situation is like this: a woman journalist is in Kabul after 9/11. She meets this bookseller, lives with his family a few months with only 3 people in the family speaking English and then she writes a book about them. First of all, having lived abroad and lived abroad with families, you can't know a family the way this author pretends to in that time. We don't even know how she interacted with the family because she writes herself out of the book entirely. She somehow thinks that she hasn't effected the family's life and that she can just describe them as if there is not some strange white woman sitting on the floor taking notes as they live their lives.The book is written with such heavy condescension that I wanted to throw up. The moral I took away from the book is that life in Afghanistan sucks, especially if you are a woman, and it's all due to their stupid culture. Warning, this is not what I think, this is what I think the author was telling me to think.The author says in the preface that she was inspired by this family. But from how she wrote the book it seems she was disgusted. I don't understand how she can write that way without even writing herself in, therefore allowing the follies of inter cultural miscommunication and misunderstanding play a part."
9932,"The Gates of Africa: Death, Discovery, and the Search for Timbuktu",Anthony Sattin,3.78,81,7,GoldGato,4,"In the late 18th century, the world's first geographical society was formed in England with the purpose of exploring Africa's unknown interior. Such explorers as Mungo Park and Jean Louis Burckhardt set forth on wild adventures, not all of which ended successfully. The legendary city of Timbuktu was the main target for many years, which many Europeans still believed was made of gold.This is a page-turner, from start to finish. As a reader, I never stopped marvelling at how unprepared each explorer was in regards to knowledge and climate. They simply didn't know very much about tropical diseases, quicksand, insects, etc. The history of the various African civilizations is stirring, and I had to pace myself so the adventure didn't end too soon for me.Book Season = Summer (hot blistering sands)"
9931,Cruelest Journey: Six Hundred Miles To Timbuktu,Kira Salak,3.92,514,71,Jenny (Reading Envy),4,"After 37 years of never reading about Mali, I have managed two books about that country in the last month. The previous book (The Bad-Ass Librarians of Timbuktu: And Their Race to Save the World’s Most Precious Manuscripts) gave more information about the history of the region, and informed my reading of this book as well. This edition appears to be a 2016 reprint of the original book published in 2004 by National Geographic.Last year, I read another book by Kira Salak about her solo journey across Papua New Guinea (Four Corners: A Journey into the Heart of Papua New Guinea, so I already knew about the author's fearlessness, her unrelenting pace, and her preference of traveling alone. Actually knowing these things about her made me look forward to reading her only other book-length non-fiction account of her travel. She has written multiple essays on other travel experiences for magazines like National Geographic, even winning the PEN Award for her reporting on the war in Congo.This 2003 journey, taking Kira 600 miles on the Niger River from Old Ségou to Timbuktu, is modeled after the 18th century explorer Mungo Park. He attempted this journey twice, not surviving the second attempt, despite having over 40 travel companions. His writings (journals, letters) as well as writings about Park are laced throughout this book. Salak clearly looks to him not only to see which parts of the journey they had in common, but to find shared experiences in the emotions along the way. Kira's trip was well documented by a National Geographic photographer, and many of those photos are up on her website.What the photos can't contain is Salak's writing, which I found engaging, especially descriptions of the landscape and its effect on her as a solo traveler. One sample:""Where is the river of just this morning, with its whitecaps that would have liked to drown me, with its current flowing backward against the wind? Gone to this: a river of smoothest glass, a placidity unbroken by wave or eddy, with islands of lush greenery awaiting me like distant Xanadus. The Niger is like a mercurial god, meting out punishment and benediction on a whim. And perhaps the god of the river sleeps now, returning matters to the mortals who ply its waters?""She also chronicles how the people along the river change as she gets closer to Timbuktu. The tribes shift, the friendliness shifts, the tension shifts. At times I was a little frustrated because she was not taking the time to understand the culture and gain acceptance into it, and often left quickly due to fear. To me, fear can be a form of racism, so I'm a bit wary of that reaction. But I reminded myself that this was the Mali that housed Al Qaeda training camps and attempted to destroy the original manuscripts of centuries ago, during this same time period. And that this is a travel writer, not an ethnographer. But it really is a distinct difference - about the journey and the faces one might encounter along the way, and the occasional orange soda.I was kindly approved for a review copy of this book by the publisher in Edelweiss. It was perfect timing for my African reading project, and I appreciate it!"

4989,The Red Tent,Anita Diamant,4.16,451855,17347,Michelle,5,"This was a very compelling read, and I don't have enough words to describe how beautiful the writing is. Anita Diamant wove a very intricate and poignant story that captivated me, and I think I'll be moonstruck for a while! The ""Red Tent"" follows the life of Jacob's daughter, Dinah, whose a minor character in the Book of Genesis. Diamant pretty much expanded Dinah's story and it's told from her POV. As her story unfolds, you will get to witness the lives of her mothers: Leah, Rachel, Zilpah, and Bilhah, as well. For a woman in the times of Genesis, life can be pretty scary. Back then, women had very little power. Their main function in society was to get hitched and produce heirs for their husband. The red tent is the one place where these women have their own world and their own power. You really won't get to see the red tent in the second half of the book, because Dinah is no longer with her mothers. Nevertheless, the memory of the red tent lingers throughout the book. Dinah constantly looks back at the red tent with nostalgia and longing, and so did I. I don't want to expound on the plot further and trust me, you will be better off reading it. ""The Red Tent"" is like an acknowledgement for all the untold stories, for the forgotten characters, and for the struggles deemed unnecessary. Most of us do not experience great glories and victories in life, rather, most of us gather our joys and small pleasures where and when we can-- and the rest of the time, we do what is necessary to survive. Dinah, does no less and does so with honor. Even minor characters have a story worth telling-- reminding us of the internal, silent, and unsung glory that can occur inside each of us as we live our lives as best we can."
5411,"The Stand, Part 2 of 2",Stephen King,4.59,100,2,Bob Kublawi,4,"After finishing ""The Dome"", a book I enjoyed a great deal listening to I decided to listen to ""The Stand"", a similar novel from King in both length (huge) and story (apocalyptic). In this novel King introduces us to a virus that escapes from a government lab and affects the respiratory system and is fatal to approximately 99% of the human population. King doesn't dwell too terribly long on the immediate after-affects or the gruesome details of the vast numbers of dying people during the epidemic. King focuses his story on how people survive afterwards. He introduces us to a number of different characters; a one hit wonder musician from California, a sociology professor, a pregnant young woman and her teenaged, nerdy neighbor boy, a factory worker from East Texas, a deaf-mute who can see the future, a criminal and a dark man, Randall Flagg. Most importantly, all of these characters have similar dreams about Flagg and about an ancient woman, Mother Abigail, who lives in Nebraska. These two characters epitomize the good and evil forces at work in the post-flu world.The story centers on two opposing masses of the post-flu epidemic, those in the ""Free Zone"" and those who are to the west and under the influence of the ""dark man"", Randall Flagg. Mother Abigail instructs the residents of the Free Zone on how to deal with Flagg's menace and the story builds from that point.I enjoyed this book as much as I did ""The Dome"". Once again, King's characterizations are vivid and make us care about who he's writing about. It's true, sometimes the characters can be a bit shallow and caricatured (in the book there is one young woman, Julie Lowry, who is a pouty sex pot and just doesn't seem real), but overall building characters is one of King's trademarks. Then, of course, there is the story, which King always builds up to carefully, meticulously and with tension. You simply don't want to put the book down (or turn off the audiobook). This is a good long read (or listen), but well worth it."
3817,A Little Original Sin: The Life and Work of Jane Bowles,Millicent Dillon,4.11,156,15,Paul Bryant,3,"There were more than a few odd things about Jane. She fell off a horse at the age of 15 and broke her leg. Then she got TB - in her leg. Which wouldn't heal. So she was sent off to a Swiss sanatorium, where she learned French & continued her education in French, whilst her mother swanned about in Paris. The TB leg took two years to get a bit better - she was in traction most of the time - and then it didn't heal. So to alleviate the pain they fused her knee, so she had a stiff leg all her life.  The family were non-practicing Jews. She figured out she was gay quite quickly, and what with that and the leg, she was prone to calling herself ""Crippie the Kike Dyke"". Which is one of those things where it was okay for her to call herself that but probably, I'm guessing, not alright for someone else to call her that.  She married a gay guy called Paul Bowles. They gave the straight thing a fairly half-hearted go, but then they opted for staying married but being separate. They did love each other, in an unusual kind of way. The Bowleses were kind of pre-beats even though Paul Bowles looked like Young Businessman of the Year 1949. (Sometimes Jane also looked like Young Businessman of the Year 1949. She liked men's attire.) They couldn't sit still. They had to be off somewhere exotic or in New York, one or the other. Eventually they decamped for Morocco and stayed there, falling in love with the locals and stoning themselves out of their brains on the local hashish. They were ill a lot. This biography says Jane wasn't an alcoholic. On Wikipedia it says Jane was an alcoholic. Given the number of pages drinking takes up in this biography I'm going with Wiki. She wrote a weird novel (Two Serious Ladies - one reviewer said that to try to explain the plot of this novel was to risk one's sanity), a weird play and six weird short stories. That's it.THE BROTHEL ANECDOTEThey were in Guatemala and Jane got to drinking with some students who expressed a desire to visit a brothel. Jane persuaded them to take her, she was curious. At the brothel, after they got there, a big guy with a pistol in his belt came in. He was the chief bodyguard of the dictator of Guatemala. He looked around the room and pointed to Jane and said ""I want that one."" Everyone said ""No, that is a tourist."" The big guy said ""I want that one."" Now that's what I call a sticky moment."
4991,Anita Diamant's The Red Tent: A Reader's Guide,Ann Finding,4.13,431,52,Echo,5,"This is my second most favorite book (the first being Jane Eyre of course). I love that the author conducted research and tried to paint a realistic picture of what our foremothers' lives were like B.C. I like that the whole novel is about Dina's life, a woman who's name was mentioned only once in the Bible. Now we have this glimpse of what her life might have been like (this is fiction of course). I love the emphasis that the author places on women's relationships with one another and how essential they truly are. My favorite line from the book is when Dina says ""My husband is my rock, but my friends are my well"" . . . . ."
5414,'Salem's Lot,Stephen King,3.99,249326,6348,Nataliya,5,"There was a time once when vampires were ruthless predators and not the misunderstood brooding and essentially harmless creatures. Ahhhh, good old scary times... Vampire stories have been around for a long time - after all, people love a good scare, and what is more terrifying than a monster showing up at night and sucking the life essence out of you? But leave it to Stephen King to turn the terror up a notch, add a whole new layer to it. How? Simply - using the winning formula that he continues to employ in the vast majority of his work. In addition to showing us the monsters of the night, he also brings into the picture the monsters and the darkness that are already with us, that live in the deep dark recesses of everyone's soul. """"The town knew about darkness.""""The town has its secrets, and keeps them well.""""The town cares for devil's work no more than it cares for God's or man's. It knew darkness. And darkness was enough.""The eponymous 'Salem's Lot is a small town in Maine, and it is not a stranger to secrets and darkness. It's quaint and pastoral on the surface, but once you look deeper you are bound to discover what lurks behind its respectable surface. And trust me, that's the discoveries that you can easily go without for the darkness of the human soul as presented by Stephen King beats everything that any monster or boogeyman can ever send your way. The small town of 'Salem's Lot can boast your usual lies, bullying, corruption, and prejudice - and spices it up with well-hidden child abuse, violence, and murders. Not so quaint, is it? It is this portrayal of everyday people's secrets, of the towns being almost like living breathing organisms that is one of the big reasons why I am a huge fan of Stephen King's works.From the very first pages of the novel we know that some terrible fate made 'Salem's Lot a ghost town with apparently only a couple of survivors. It doesn't take the reader long to realize, as we go back in time to see how the events unfolded, that the mysterious menacing Marsten House welcomed new evil that tends to lurk at night, floating past your (hopefully, tightly shut) windows. The story itself is rather straightforward, steadily moving along to its almost-conclusion that we have glimpsed in the first few pages, and we watch with bated breath as our bunch of good guys - Ben, Mark, Susan, Matt - are trying to take on the supernatural horror. Oh, and did I forget Father Callahan? (view spoiler)[A high-five from the Dark Tower universe, Father! (hide spoiler)]King is excellent with the plotting and the pacing (since this was only his second novel, he was still a stranger to writing larger-than-life brick-sized tomes). The story never lags, the suspense and sense of foreboding are rampant, and there are quite a few truly nailbiting situations. Nothing distracts the reader from the vampire story unfolding on the background of small-town horrors. There are no heavy-handed lessons to be learned, no deep morals to take out of the story - all we get is a thrilling and quite scary ride that may make you (a) sleep with a light on, and (b) be very careful about who you invite into your home. 5 stars."
5410,Apocalipsis ,Stephen King,4.34,477326,14071,Kemper,5,"You know what’s really scary? Getting sick while you’re reading the first part of The Stand. Just try running a fever, going through a box of tissues and guzzling the better part of a bottle of NyQuil while Stephen King describes the grisly deaths of almost every one on Earth from a superflu. On top of feeling like crap, you'll be terrified. Bonus!After a bio-engineered virus that acts like a revved up cold escapes from a U.S. government lab, it takes only weeks for almost all of humanity to succumb to the disease. A handful of survivors are mysteriously immune and begin having strange dreams, some of which are about a very old woman called Mother Abigail asking them to come see her. More disturbing are nightmares about a mysterious figure named Randall Flagg also known as the Dark Man or the Walkin’ Dude.As they make their way through an America almost entirely devoid of people, the survivors begin to unite and realize that the flu was just the beginning of their problems. While some are drawn to the saintly Mother Abigail in Boulder Colorado who tells them that they have been chosen by God, others have flocked to Flagg in Las Vegas who is determined to annihilate all those who refuse to pledge their allegiance to him.If King would have just written a book about a world destroyed by plague and a small number of people struggling in the aftermath, it probably would have been a compelling story. What sets this one apart is the supernatural element. Flagg is the embodiment of evil and chaos. He's a mysterious figure who has been giving the wrong people the push needed for them to make things worse for everyone, and he sees the plague as his chance to fulfill his own destiny as a wrecker of humanity. And on the other side, we have God. Yep, that God. The Big Cheese himself. But this isn’t some kindly figure in a white robe with a white beard or George Burns or Morgan Freeman. This is the Old Testament God who demands obedience and worship while usually rewarding his most faithful servants with gruesome deaths. King calls this a tale of dark Christianity in his forward, and one of the things I love about this book is that it does feel like a Biblical story, complete with contradictions and a moves-in-mysterious-ways factor. Stories don’t get much more epic than this, and King does a great job of depicting the meltdown of the world through the stories of a variety of relateable characters. (Larry Underwood remains among my favorite King creations.) One of my few complaints is that this features a lot of King’s anti-technology themes that he’d use in several books like Cell or The Dark Tower series. We’re told repeatedly that the ‘old ways’ like trying to get the power back on in Boulder are a ‘death trip’. The good guys gather in the Rocky Mountains, but if they try to get the juice going so they won’t freeze to death in the winter, they’re somehow acting in defiance of God’s will and returning to the bad habits? Not all tech is bad tech, Mr. King. Nature is a bitch and will kill your ass quicker than the superflu.Here’s another thing I’m not wild about. When this was published in the late ‘70s, the bean counters at King’s publishers had decided that the book as written would be too pricey in hardback and no one would pay a whopping $13 for a Stephen King hardback. So King cut about three hundred pages.Around 1990 after it had become apparent that King could publish his shopping list as a best seller, he put those pages back in and released the uncut version. Which I’m fine with. The original stuff was cut for a financial reason, not an editorial one, and there’s some very nice bits of story added in. If King would have stopped there, we would have had a great definitive final version as originally created by the author.Unfortunately, he seemed to catch a case of Lucasitis and decided to update the story a bit and change its original time frame from 1980 to 1990. I’m not sure why that seemed necessary to him. Yes, the book was a bit dated by then, but it was of its time. He didn’t rewrite the text (Which I’m grateful for.), but just stuck in some references to Madonna and Ronald Reagan and Spuds McKenzie. This led to a whole bunch of anachronisms. Would students in 1990 call soldiers ’war pigs’? Someone in New York picks up a phone book to look up the number to call an ambulance instead of dialing 911? A song called Baby, Can You Dig Your Man is a huge hit? None of it quite fits together. There's also a layer of male chauvinism and lack of diversity that you can overlook in a book written in the late '70s, but seems out of place for a book set and updated for 1990.The things that irritate me are still far outweighed by one of my favorite stories of an apocalyptic battle between good and evil.I’m also glad to get a long overdue audio edition of this book. Great narration and 40+ hours of end of the world horror make for a damn fine listening experience."

6564,Cry for the Strangers,John Saul,3.81,2502,40,Bobby Underwood,3,"I remembered reading this in my youth and enjoying it, but find it doesn’t measure up as an adult. John Saul was a much different type of writer than King and Koontz, his books fashioned on creepiness rather than horror. Cry for the Strangers is broken up into three parts — Book One, Book Two, Book Three — and therein lies much of the problem with this story about a fictional seaside town called Clark’s Harbor and the four people who have moved there and find it not welcoming to strangers.Book One is the best portion, John Saul doing a wonderful job of setting everything up, ratcheting up the creepiness as old legends and some mysterious deaths come into play, as do the townspeople. The husband wants to write a book about biorhythms and try to figure out why young Robbie, a former patient and son of the second couple, has so improved since moving to this unwelcoming town. It’s not a gripping, edge of your seat kind of story, but you’re hooked, willing to keep turning pages to discover what’s happening in Clark’s Harbor. But then comes Book Two.In the second section, we follow around the unlikable sheriff, while the main two protagonists return to pack for the big move, placing them off-stage. It was while they were off-stage in part two that it came to me what was wrong with this story, which I’ll get to in a bit.Book Three is better, as the main couple return. While there is some excitement, the ending, rather than being creepy, sort of ruins it for this reader. This same ending would have worked well if this had been a short story -- perhaps even a novelette or novella -- and that’s what is wrong with this book. This is so long, and the reader has so much invested, that we expect more than we get, and certainly not that final scene.This is a terrific short story which has been stretched beyond belief, into a bloated novel. It isn’t that the idea, the premise, isn’t good, it’s that it’s a thick rubber band stretched until the elasticity barely holds. It was an early effort from Saul, but most of his books follow this same kind of pattern. I loved this as a teenager, found it creepy. But as an adult, I find the narrative stretched so far that the creepiness became muted, highlighting the book’s bloated length. Saul can write, and I can’t help feeling this one in particular would have made a wonderful read had it been much shorter -- trimming down then combining parts one and three, and losing part two entirely.I wouldn’t discourage anyone from giving this a read, since they might like it better than I did. I didn’t dislike it, but I ruined a fond teenage memory by revisiting this book. Maybe the old saying is true, that you just can’t go home again…"
6404,Secrets  Mysteries of the World,Sylvia Browne,3.85,1263,70,Gracee,4,"After i have read this book, I felt like I was so enlightened. I was engrossed reading the Christian Controversies because I know I was lost, I am clueless about things that i should take note of. Like in the Lost years of Jesus Christ, we all know that He is our savior, the Messiah, the anointed one but in the book, it says there that Jesus learned alot when he traveled especially when he went to India where he learned most of his teachings and practices. What surprised me more is that this book also gave me some ideas regarding Jesus and Mary Magdalene, now is we discuss this during those times, I might be burned at stake here now. It says on the book that together with Mary, the three of them traveled and Jesus with Mary Magdalene build a family. I need to find books regarding this because I am engrossed in it. So if you are looking for some answers then this books will definitely give you some explanations."
6565,Sleepwalk,John Saul,3.8,4352,55,Kasia,4,"Trippy trip into the desert heatI’ve had such a good time reading lately that I haven’t realized I was falling behind on my reviews so here we go… This particular title from good ole’ Saul was a fun little romp that crossed a suspense thriller with a sci-fish mystery, I found it at my local library in the beginning of December - the shiny brand new copy beckoning to be read so I took it, somehow it was almost forgotten but in the end I saw it again two weeks later by my bed and just picked it up, I was glued to the page and engrossed the whole time, not the best book I ever read but kinda cool, who knew? Saul is well known for his suspense mixed with a bit of terror, and that’s certainly what he delivered here, I saw the reviews were mixed about this one but I just read it with an open mind one page at a time, and I all ready knew that if I hated it all I had to do was stop, but somehow the book asked to be picked up so I personally liked it, not exactly pulled together at the end but it was fun for an early Saul, prefect library rental as I call it. A small and quiet New Mexico town is the perfect set up for this story; Borrego seems pretty ordinary at first but upon closer look something is going on, this is no sleeping town; something is brewing under that dry sand and heat. Located near an oil refinery with an Indian reservation close by it seems very boring until someone decides to shake things up, the teens are restless and up to no good and something or someone finally decides to take the matter into their own hands and deliver justice as it seems fit. Girls walking off the cliff, teens and adults meeting early and unexplained deaths seem connected to a plan that doesn’t want to be solved. When Judith Sheffield comes back this time as a grown up and as a teacher to escape all the violence and noise of LA she has no idea that she has stepped into a bigger pool of pain and fear than the one she was trying to escape. Along with some old friends and new students she is plunged into a situation that tries her sanity and in the end her life, she was a great character that made the book so fast moving, her interaction with Jed and his father propelled the story right into my head and I had a hard time putting it down. Personal and professional lives at stake, the town is starting to feel a strange push, flu shots don’t even seem safe as a controlling force is clamping a dark hand on anyone living in Borrego with a purpose, its up to our friends to find out what is going on before being deleted from the equation by the very forces they are trying to uncover. The ending was pretty awesome and intense even though it didn’t wrap all the ends. Fun read, like I said not perfect but enjoyable.Kasia S."
6018,Tu Fu: China's Greatest Poet,W. Hung,3.5,2,1,Tom,3,"An English-language version of a traditional Chinese approach to Du Fu 杜甫, providing a biographical reading of 374 of his poems. An excellent introduction for the curious beginner with little to no Chinese. The poems are rendered as prose, but are often lively. His scholarship is scrupulous (especially if you consult the follow-up volume containing his notes), but limited by the methods of traditional Chinese criticism. Poetic technique is almost always subordinated to the image of Du Fu as a moral exemplar responding to the withering power of the Tang Empire. Nonetheless, it gives you a great sense of how Du Fu has been read by Chinese literati for the last thousand years."
6015,A Little Primer of Tu Fu,David Hawkes,4.31,13,2,Hadrian,4,"This is a unique little book - a collection of thirty-five of Du Fu's poems, collected from a famous anthology (The 唐诗三百首), and presents them to an interested reader who knows little or no Chinese. Hawkes presents the original Chinese text with a Pinyin transliteration into Pinyin. After this, he makes some remarks about the title and the poem's historical context, and then a strongly literal line-by-line (and in some cases word-by-word) translation into English, and then a 'prose crib' of the poem. There's also a vocabulary index with page numbers and a glossary of place names.This is well-presented - though this was supposed to be for the novice Chinese learner, I still learned much from the nuances which Hawkes presents, as well as the extensive historical context, which is often missing from the usual anthologies. And this is only a selection of Du Fu's work, which will of course have major omissions - for the rest, refer to the six-volume set published by Stephen Owen this year. Though there are still some things missing (e.g. a listing of the various 'types' or poetic forms which Du Fu uses), and I found only a few errors (inconsistent transliteration for place names and proper names), this is by all accounts an excellent introduction to Du Fu's work, and Chinese poetry as a whole, and even the aspects which might otherwise be lost in translation. Strongly recommended to anyone interested in foreign-language poetry, translation, or just Du Fu's work."
6105,Byzantium: The Apogee,John Julius Norwich,4.39,765,30,Antigone,3,"The second volume in Norwich's highly-touted trilogy on Byzantium, this work takes the civilization from 800 through 1081 A.D. - or roughly the start of the crusading influences - and contains a good deal more detail than the first. (Apparently, around the year 800, Byzantians began to see the worth in actually writing things down.) While not quite as melodramatic as Seutonius' Lives of the Twelve Caesars, there's enough high-handed behavior here to have kept the gossips fed for centuries. Norwich remains a pleasant read; he had a lot of ground to cover and he did not dawdle."
6104,Byzantium (Vol. 3): The Decline and Fall,John Julius Norwich,4.4,742,34,Antigone,3,"The third and final volume of Norwich's trilogy on the Byzantine civilization carries the empire through the Crusades, the rise of the Ottoman threat, and the disintegration - through internal miscalculation and external apathy - of the culture that kept Greek and Roman influence alive throughout the Dark Ages.Standing as a bulwark against the ravaging hordes of the East, she provided safe passage for resentful religious armies intent on ""liberating"" Jerusalem, came frequently to the negotiating table in an attempt to heal her rift with the Latin papacy, and succumbed to the role of your basic marketing hockey puck through centuries of ruthless full-body checks between the shipping magnates of Venice and Genoa.These are the sad years, rife with ineffectual leadership and short-term solutions, sacrifice and loss. Norwich catalogues it all, and honors this titanic kingdom in full as it fades forever from view."
6102,The Middle Sea: A History of the Mediterranean,John Julius Norwich,3.87,641,66,Marita,4,"This book is reminiscent of one of those tours where today you visit the Eiffel tower, tomorrow you rush through the treasures of the Hermitage Museum and the following day you find yourself in the outer Hebrides. Having time travelled through several centuries on a whirlwind tour of the history of the Mediterranean, I am now suffering from a severe case of information overload. Don't get me wrong; this book is excellent, but there is a lot of information to process. In places I became more confused than enlightened, simply because of my own lack of knowledge and the sheer volume of information. To be honest, I have managed to only absorb a small fraction of the information presented here. Fortunately John Julius Norwich has written several books which provide more information on specific subjects, which will allow me to focus on those topics of particular interest to me.Essentially this book is a summary of the history of the Mediterranean starting about 3000BC and continuing to the first half of the twentieth century condensed into 688 pages. Almost anything I say is bound to be inadequate, but here is a listing of the chapters (plus a few miscellaneous tidbits) to give you some idea of what is discussed in this book:I Beginnings Egyptians, Phoenicians, Crete, Mycenae, Troy, Canaan (Palestine), Babylon, etc.II Ancient GreeceThe Golden Age: Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Aristophanes, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle”Aristotle was more than a philosopher; his surviving oeuvre also contains works on ethics, history, science, politics, literary and dramatic criticism, nature, meteorology, dreams and –a particular interest of his –zoology. He was, in short, a polymath –perhaps the first in history. And he left behind him the first true library, a vast collection of manuscripts and maps which was the prototype for Pergamum, Alexandria and all the other great public libraries of antiquity.”Alexander the Great, Ptolemy, CleopatraIII Rome: The Republic Carthage, Hannibal, Punic Wars, Sulla, Pompey, Marcus Licinius Crassus, Gaius Julius Caesar, Spartacus, Mark AntonyIV Rome: The Early Empire Virgil and Horace - Roman art and literature vs that of the Greeks plus Roman achievements in law, science and engineeringRome’s golden age and the Emperor HadrianConstantine and Constantinople (“When Constantine first set eyes on Byzantium, the city was already nearly a thousand years old.”), JustinianGoths, Huns, Visigoths and VandalsThe Huns: “For clothing they favoured tunics made from the skins of field mice crudely stitched together. These they wore continuously, without ever removing them, until they dropped off of their own accord. Their home was the saddle; they seldom dismounted, not even to eat or to sleep.”V IslamThe Prophet Mohammed, Charles Martel, Tariq, Abdul-Rahman and his grandson Abdul-Rahman II”Abdul-Rahman’s later years were a good deal more tranquil. He never succeeded in imposing political unity on Spain, but he was a wise and merciful ruler and a deeply cultivated man. His capital city of Cordoba he transformed, endowing it with a magnificent palace, a famously beautiful garden and – most important of all – with the Mezquita, its great mosque, begun in 785 on the site of the early Christian cathedral, which when completed was the most sumptuous mosque in the world and still stands today.”The Alhambra Palace complex in Granada, Spain.”Mathematics and medicine, geography and astronomy and the physical sciences were still deeply mistrusted in the Christian world; in that of Islam, they had been developed to a point unequalled since the days of ancient Greece.”Adelard of BathVI Medieval Italy The LombardsPepin, King of the FranksThe Papal States CharlemagneInvasion of Sicily by North African ArabsThe arrival of the Normans in the south and the de Hauteville family”In Roger II Europe saw one of the greatest and most colourful rulers of the Middle Ages. Born of an Italian mother, raised in Sicily where – thanks to his father’s principles of total religious toleration – Greek and Saracen mingled on equal footing with Norman and Latin, in appearance a southerner, in temperament an oriental, he had yet inherited all the ambition and energy of his Norman forebears and combined them with a gift for civil administration entirely his own.” ""His supreme monument is the Palatine Chapel, which he built during the 1130s and 1140s on the first floor of the royal palace of Palermo.""VII The Christian Counter-AttackThe crusades, The Knights of St John and the Templars, Louis VII of France and his queen, Eleanor of AquitaineSalah ed-Din (Saladin), Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, Richard Coeur-de-Lion of England, Philip Augustus of France, etc.”Constantinople in the twelfth century was the most intellectually and artistically cultivated metropolis of the world, and the chief repository of Europe’s classical heritage, both Greek and Roman.

He would spend hours not only in study but in long disputations on religion, philosophy or mathematics.""""The Emperor took full control of criminal justice, instituted a body of itinerant judges acting in his name, curtailed the liberties of the barons, the clergy and the towns, and laid the foundations of a system of firm government paralleled only in England, with similar representation of nobility, churchmen and citizens.”X The End of OutremerCharles of Anjou The Sicilian Vespers: ”The French were already hated throughout the Regno, both for the severity of their taxation and for the arrogance of their conduct, and when, on the evening of 30 March, a drunken French sergeant began importuning a Sicilian woman outside the Church of Santo Spirito just as the bells were ringing for vespers, her countrymen’s anger boiled over.

4564,Vintage Murder (Robbie Cutler Diplomatic Mystery #1),William S. Shepard,3.33,21,4,Patricia,4,"Robbie Cutler, a thirty-something year old foreign service member, isn't your stereotypical career diplomat. He's young, informal at times, and interested in the culture and history of Bordeaux where he serves as the acting consul. He's interested in 'cloak and dagger' activities and becomes involved in a mystery when a wine grower is killed.The book is a bit old fashion in a good sense. Robbie is well educated (Brown) and he grew up abroad (his father was a career diplomat) but in many ways he is naive. He soon learns more about politics, personal danger and love. The author loves the wine, people, geography, and lifestyle of the area and shares it with the readers.The series continues when Robbie gets a new assignment.No sex: you know Robbie and Syvie are involved but you don't know any of the details"
9957,The Cement Garden,Ian McEwan,3.57,18613,1358,Fabian,4,"Will ever these tales of incest cease? Well, my true guess is no, for they sure do captivate (lookin' atchu V.C. Andrews [R.I.P., girl]!). Another case in point: this early novel from major Nobel contender (I'm certain of this, right?) Ian McEwan. ""The Cement Garden"" is considered by critics to be ""Lord of the Flies""-like in its plot structure and because it contains young protagonists. But I must venture to say that it mostly resembles an early version of Bertolucci's ""Dreamers"" (of course by that I mean its novel predecessor)-- this is similarly an enchanted but megagrueling experience. After ""Atonement"", ""Cement Garden"" takes second place in the Maestro of English Prose's impressive (though uneven) repertoire."
9958,The Daydreamer,Ian McEwan,3.71,3444,329,Lynda,3,"I once heard Ian McEwan described as a Marmite author; a distinctive taste that, in line with the Marmite marketing slogan, you either ""Love it or hate it."" I must admit, I've had my share of ""hit and miss"" with McEwan but I did enjoy The Daydreamer, which is his first work of fiction for children. The book is described however as appealing to adults as well, due in part to the fact that it is an ""adult"" Peter who tells the story of his childhood.The Daydreamer is about 10 year Peter Fortune who is a chronic daydreamer. He transforms boring events into elaborate stories in his head, making mundane situations more fun. Peter believes that the reality of his life can rarely live up to the things his mind concocts.The Daydreamer is told in the form of seven interlinking stories, all of which reveal the secret journeys, metamorphoses and adventures of Peter's childhood.What I particularly enjoyed about this book was that daydreaming was portrayed as an essential dimension of play, for adults and children alike. In daydreaming, we’re free to psychologically traverse through every obscure or far flung thought. We’re welcome to try on any solution or scenario that piques our interest at the moment. Let's face it -- who hasn’t indulged in a little Walter Mitty style fantasy and not felt better – or at least been pleasantly amused – for it? Isn’t it how we become more fully ourselves?So here's my suggestion for the day:  Make some time for losing yourself in thought. Drop everything and do it now, or schedule it if you have to. Don’t go to bed tonight without endeavoring some kind of cerebral journey. Your brain – and perhaps your well-being – will be the better for it.3.5*/5"
2518,The Baby Name Wizard: A Magical Method for Finding the Perfect Name for Your Baby,Laura Wattenberg,4.11,693,119,Nicola,5,"In The Baby Name Wizard, Laura Wattenberg uses computer modelling, historical/social research and good old-fashioned critical thinking to analyze baby naming trends and sort names into ‘types’. Evelyn is ‘antique’; Finn is ‘brisk and breezy’; Hayden is ‘androgynous’.Wattenberg’s advice on naming is thoughtful and perceptive; she doesn’t disparage any names, but she does give food for thought. For parents-to-be, the main draw is the ability to assess the popularity of your favoured name (whadaya mean, my rare name choice is actually a rising star?), and the ability to find names that are “sorta like X, but not so well-known”.However, I don’t use this book as a parenting reference; I use it as a writing tool.I was sorting through some old notebooks recently and I found in one of them pages and pages of names. I must have compiled this list of names when I was about 12. It’s not because I was baby-crazy or desperate to be on ‘16 and Pregnant’. I was just a budding writer with lots of characters to name.Truth: writers spend way more time obsessing over baby names than expectant parents, because parents might have 2, 3, 4 kids, but writers ‘Christen’ dozens of babies every year. So don’t let the adorable baby on the cover put you off; this is an indispensible writing tool.I can’t count the number of times I’ve started a new writing project, begun to sketch out my characters and then got stuck on finding a name. The problem isn’t solved by picking up a name dictionary and opening it on a random page. If my heroine is sharp and sarcastic, I can’t call her ‘Lucy’. This is the sort of situation where Wizard becomes indispensible. If you know you want a brisk, one-syllable name, just look up that ‘type’ and find a whole selection to choose from.Wizard is also great for avoiding anachronisms, because it includes charts of each name’s rising/falling popularity. If your hero was born in 1980, he shouldn’t be called ‘Braeden’. That’s an obvious example, but a lot of names we assume were popular during a certain time period actually weren’t.The ‘brother/sister’ suggestions that come with each name are also incredibly useful – although not necessarily for brothers and sisters. If you’re going to spend 100,000 words writing about best friends or lovers, it’s helpful that their names “go together”. Who wants to end up writing “Amethyst and Jack walked down the street… Amethyst and Jack went to the shops… Amethyst and Jack were in big trouble”?You can access a lot of Wizard’s features (popularity charts, for example) from its accompanying website, but the book’s more in-depth and it’s a handy reference to have within easy reach when you’re writing."
2517,My Name is Red,Orhan Pamuk,3.83,33873,3097,Darcy,5,"Generally, when a book starts out with a chapter entitled ""I Am A Corpse,"" you know it's going to be pretty good. The novel is set up so that each chapter introduces a different narrator, including (but not limited to), Black, Black's uncle, Shekure, a dog, a horse, the murderer and various artists in the workshop. This type of structure for a mystery novel isn't new--Wilkie Collins, for example, employed it several times, most notably in The Moonstone--and it is an effective way to structure a story so as to hide the whodunit. Each character only tells as much as he, she or it knows and in Pamuk's novel even the murderer hides his or her identity.The structure in ""My Name Is Red,"" though is less designed to sustain suspense and more to allow room for the various philosophical discussions concerning the purpose of art and, perhaps more importantly, the distinctions between Islamic states and Western Europe. The Frankish mode of painting, particularly of portraiture--to glorify the subject, to paint him or her in terms of his/her earthly wealth and power, to distribute such an image openly as a show of control, to demonstrate the creative abilities of the artist--is at the center of these debates and discussions. Black's uncle finds such images alluring and fascinating while others see them as abhorent. Master Osman, for example, sees himself as being forced to choose between the centuries old Islamic traditions he venerates and the more modern and distinctly foreign style he despises. Such a choice is not made easily, as the artists themselves discover. The Frankish method celebrates the individuation of the artist--it prizes the signature of the artist as much as the commissioner of the image. This reverence for the artist, as much as for the piece of art, proves to be a great temptation to the men involved and leads directly to the murder.The structure, however, also allows for a second discussion, not about art but about writing on art. As much as this is a novel concerning visual images, it is also a novel about ekphrasis--the verbal description of art. Ekphrasis has the effect of slowing down a narrative, of interrupting it. Thus, in Homer's Illiad, the great battle scene is suddenly punctured by a lengthy description of Achilles' shield. Pamuk plays with this model repeatedly. When the image of the horse, described several times in the novel, is given a voice of its own the narrative is not interrupted, but rather the description of the image becomes the narrative. And, moreover, as the image speaks it refutes the fundamental principles underlying Master Osman's devotion to Islamic traditions of art. Pamuk can hardly resist the joke--this is a novel about art in which not a single image appears, except the map at the beginning and the ones we create in our minds as we imagine the images described. But, are we creating an image of the ideal horse, the horse of God, or one we can actually touch, taste, and smell?"
9934,To Timbuktu,Mark Jenkins,3.85,199,34,Judy,4,"Mark Jenkins, Mike Moe and their friends John Haines and Rick Smith set off to Africa with the goal of reaching the source of the Niger river something sought but never quite accomplished by other famous explorers such as Mungo Park. Mark and Mike leave wives pregnant with their first children. From the start of the journey, the men find themselves flying downstream on a swift current heading for a wall of brush and trees blocking their progress. Mark and Mike find ways through but John and Rick struggle to penetrate the brushy fortress. The incident defines the trip illuminating the fact that Mark and Mike's purpose for the trip is adventure while John and Rick's revolves around more erudite contemplations. These differences characterize the remainder of the trip resulting in good conversations but also difficult decisions later on.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. My love for adventure was primed throughout, I felt like I was cutting through the muddy Niger, running from crocs, facing hippos and about getting clothes-lined by vines and branches while navigating the swift current. My decision to not rate this 5 stars was based on Jenkins' use of too many metaphors and descriptives at times. I felt like he was trying too hard to write beautiful sentences at some points. He certainly has an excellent vocabulary, but preferred the sections where he simply wrote. The other drawback was only minor. Jenkins interjects small sections of history about explorers who attempted to find the mouth of the Niger. I enjoyed these because he keeps them short and to the point. He also included short reminisces of other trips that he and Mike took when younger that included harrowing anecdotes that coincide with their escapes on the Niger. I like the use of both of these looks back, but I think they would be better suited if they were either placed as insets separating from the actual story or give them their own very short chapters. It is a little jarring to be reading along and all of sudden a sentence or paragraph in realize that you are reading about something/someone entirely different. It makes the chapters a little choppy.Overall, I loved the book and will be recommending it to my adventure-reading daughter. It was a very quick read at only 221 pages."

7943,Primrose Day,Carolyn Haywood,4,100,16,Susann,4,"This is the book that launched my Anglophilia. Also my interest in WWII stories, evacuee stories, Scottie dogs, and hair-dos with ribbons on the sides. Of course, Haywood's story shows an awfully charmed evacuee experience. Can I go stay with Aunt Helen and Uncle Bill, too? It's interesting to think of this being published in 1942 with no one knowing the outcome of the War or how long the evacuees would be in the States. The story appears to take place in 1940, which means Merry will be about 12 or 13 when she finally goes home.Childhood fascination: I remember learning the word ""lorry"" from this, and wanting to learn more distinctly English words.Last read: 6-6-05"
4155,Canastas Sagradas: Lecciones Espirituales De Un Guerrero De Los Tableros,Phil Jackson,3.96,2804,213,Michael Scott,5,"I first discovered this book in the late nineties during a time of great discord and transition in my life. Phil's approach to life, which embodies merging one's vocation with a larger spiritual quest, was transformational for me. His book offers a unique look at the bizarre tactics he used to build a winning formula as a basketball coach as well in his own life exploration. I found myself particularly enamored with the following sentence in his book:""In basketball -- as in life -- true joy comes from being fully present in each and every moment, not just when things are going your way.""Digesting this passage was like having a light switch go on in terms of that peaceful elixir I had been seeking my entire life. I immediately put this principle to work and have found it to be quite beneficial over the years in staying grounded amidst today's chaotic worldI have since read this book a dozen times and consider it to be my all-time favorite."
7679,The Terminal Man,Michael Crichton,3.34,20805,631,Anne,3," The Terminal Man is so far my least favorite of all Michael Crichton's novels. (I'm almost finished reading all of his fiction books.) But I couldn't rate it lower than three-stars, because this is Crichton, for pity's sake. He's one of my favorite authors. And I suppose the tremendous research and effort dedicated in this book is worth an additional star. Okay, so this is about a man named Benson who frequently had violent seizures. People from the Neuropsychiatric Research Unit decided to apply some experimental methods to him that were never used in humans before, in an attempt to ""cure"" him. Whenever Benson would have a seizure, the electrodes placed in his brain would at once pulse some sort of pleasurable sensation. Apparently Benson liked this feeling very much that he managed to increase the stimulation (which would lead normally lead to seizures) in order to feel that pleasurable response. But it became too much for his brain to handle, and soon enough he was on the loose with a deadly intent on his mind.I'm glad my General Biology class came in pretty handy, so I wasn't lost in all those scientific terminologies regarding the nervous system. One of the things I noticed here is that there isn't too much piling of information. I think that's a good thing, especially if you're the type of reader who'd get tired of the unceasing lectures and technical discussions. Nevertheless, I felt really educated after reading this because Crichton still inserted several tidbits every now and then, especially during dialogues (the briefing/ interview part of Benson was cleverly used). The pace is very quick. Even the novel is quite short, and I finished it in about three hours or less. Unlike his other novels, there wasn't much history or background on the characters. And the point-of-view primarily centered on Dr. Ross. It's rather rare for him to use a woman as the main character. Though to be honest, one couldn't really pinpoint a single person who could effectively be considered as the protagonist. Furthermore, it was very straightforward. I like that simplicity and economy of words and pages.However, because of that, the characters didn't develop very much. There was hardly any time for characterization. And I felt like I wasn't able to get to know the characters better.The writing could be better. But I understand that this was written much earlier. And having read Crichton's latter works, I can say that his writing style improved immensely. Sadly, in this book, the descriptions were a bit bland. (I'll cite an example when I get a hold of my copy.)The suspense wasn't as intense as I expected. I'm not complaining; I think it was still satisfying. But the thrill only arrived towards the end of the book, which was unlike Crichton's other novels (as there was usually a continuous dose of thrill available all throughout).

 was a very intelligently-crafted work. I felt so smart after reading it, as if a considerable amount of knowledge was entered into my brain. (Heh, mind control, indeed.)Although this isn't really my favorite, I'd still recommend this. The main reason would probably be because the subject matter is controversial and leaned more on psychology and ethics than medical science. The implications of this research were massive, indeed."

I was invited by someone I was once close to, a gorgeous male model,(view spoiler)[ I could pull back then! Nah not really, I'd been friends with the family for years (hide spoiler)] to his father's huge 90th birthday party on their private island. The old guy who is pretty fit running businesses, did a stand-up cabaret as he always used to, but there was no one left alive to understand his jokes which were all set before the 50s it seemed. His daughter, a good friend and also a model, told me that the pop-up sex book I bought as a present is the same one her father gave to her the year before! They are an interesting family. The OG's late wife said they sold their bus, the Magic Bus to Charlie Manson. (view spoiler)[They were a great deal older than their children, several generations, I think they couldn't give up their mad life traipsing across the US and sailing charter yachts to settle down. (hide spoiler)]On reflection, giving a man of 90 The Pop-up Book of Sex for a birthday present was ill-considered. Not that I learned my lesson as you will see. A few weeks later at Sunday brunch at a sort of country club near the beach, he joined me & my lunch date, a man of 83 (view spoiler)[I don't know what it is with me and the old guys, but there's another one as well, he's 81 and used to be an Vogue model, lol. They are not the objects of my lust, however. (hide spoiler)] & offered me an apartment in a house he was buying in the club grounds if I would be his gf (or similar! Meaning sex and go travelling with him, he travels all the time.) I was surprised and a bit flirty and just turned it into a joke. After a while, his daughter called me over to the bar to ask if her father 'had a chance at... you know'. No I said. NO. But here he is again aged 91 & this time I was the birthday present his son gave him for his party. Me and this Pop-Up Sex book.****This was written a few months ago on General Updates as it happenedI had an interesting night last night. I went to a birthday party and got felt up by the birthday boy who was celebrating his 91st year. He asked me to lunch next day and since I've known him forever, I couldn't really say no. He's fit - runs 2 hotels and a couple of houses he rents in three countries. Can you imagine being that fit at 91? And still hoping to score! I wonder if he ever does? I can't imagine who would though... Not me, sah! This year, not having learned my lesson last year, for a present I bought him a pornographic photographic book of 40s & 50s nudes. It was a nice party in the apartment that he'd offered me the year before. Little candles lit the old stone steps up to the garden and the courtyard pool. There was a buffet with a chef. All ages from children on up were there, it was very friendly. It was genteel living like out of a magazine on how rich people live. I think I was a bit intimidated because I spent half the time talking to the chef who'd catered it.He was the OG's friend and ex-employee who owned a restaurant in Portugal. So when the OG asked me out for lunch next day, I begged him to come.He said the OG is harmless. I said would you go out alone for lunch with a woman of 91 who expected you for dessert? He saw the point & came to lunch too next day. And brought his Brazilian boyfriend!Lunch with the OG, the chef & his boyfriend was ok except that the OG was continually looking down my cleavage. I was wearing an extreme push-up bra and 2 buttons of the Henley undone so I wasn't surprised really. He started to take pics with his phone, so I pulled the wings of the t-shirt away so he could get a good view but only 2 buttons worth (I was both amused & pissed off with him) & he was so surprised he dropped his phone in his eggs benedict. The whole thing got the attention of a large and drunk party at the next table. So I gave him my cell no. & left. He's phoned since then. Asked me to dinner on his island where he, or rather his son and daughter now, have a restaurant and bar. He said he was doing the cabaret (view spoiler)[spare me any more pre WWII jokes please. (hide spoiler)] I said I didn't want to sit there on my own. He said that he would sit with me when he wasn't performing. Just what I wanted to hear.Then he phoned me just before he left for the UK and asked me out for lunch. Couldn't make it, I was going to be off-island. He's persistent isn't he? I wonder what he'll think up next?Book ReviewThis is a real 5* star winner of a book. It's near coffee table-size and each double page spread is a beautifully-engineered paper cutout of sexual fantasies. One of the best is the Mile High Club. Some of the spreads (pun not really intended) actually move. Just a beautiful book and a great gift, but perhaps not for a lustful, panting, horny old 90 year old man. Perhaps I should have bought him bed socks or a cheerful coffee mug or something like that."
4631,A Moveable Feast,Ernest Hemingway,4.04,91841,6452,Jeffrey Keeten,3,"”If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man, then wherever you go for the rest of your life, it stays with you, for Paris is a moveable feast.” Ernest Hemingway The Lost Generation: Hemingway and the circle of ex-pat friends he later immortalised in The Sun Also Rises. More friends, including Harold Loeb, the model for Robert Cohn in The Sun Also Rises, on the left, Hemingway in the centre and Hadley on the right.I hadn’t planned to read this book until I read this great article in the The Atlantic that was published recently by Joe Fassler that consists of a conversation he had with Daniel Woodrell. This article which whether you care one wit about Woodrell or for that matter Ernest Hemingway is still an inspiring read. http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainm... Woodrell while bumming around Mexico found himself negotiating a trade with a hungry young American of a meal for a copy of A Moveable Feast. Woodrell ended up buying two tacos for a book that changed his life. He was ni-ni-nin-teen. He read the book through several times and for the price of two tacos it set him on the course to being a writer. I have not read Hemingway for decades. I often think of him as a gateway drug to better literature. As you can imagine ever since my son was old enough to read I’ve been chucking books at him that I felt that he should read with frankly disappointing results. Books stabbed with bristling bookmarks littered his room and were left for dead. I realized I was trying to move him forward too fast and so I thought about what I liked to read when I was first becoming a reader. I tossed Robert Louis Stevenson and Edgar Rice Burroughs into his room. The books came back gnawed and masticated. I did a little dance.Then I gave him Hemingway. I heard the snap of the bear trap. He read everything he could get his hands on by Hemingway. In fact he has now read more Hemingway than I have. He then went on to Fitzgerald and expanded out to reading some film history books. By the whisker of my chiny chin chin he became a reader. Despite the ease in reading Hemingway’s sparse prose I found myself squirming every time I sat down to read this book. I like vocabulary and the Oxford English Dictionary has listings for 171,476 words in current use, and 47,156 obsolete words. To this may be added around 9,500 derivative words. So when we write we have a choice of 228,132 words to express ourselves. It feels like Hemingway cuts out 227,000 of them. The average literate adult knows 50,000, but may only use 17,000 and some studies show as low as 5,000. If you count for instance DRIVE, DRIVER AND DRIVES as three separate words our language blossoms to over 600,000 entries. Hemingway was bucking against the establishment when he decided that adjectives were not necessary and sliced his prose down to just the bare minimum of what the reader needs. Short sentences, short words. I don’t mind some purple in my prose. William Faulkner’s famous epic opening sentence for Absalom! Absalom! was 1,288 words long. James Joyce in Ulysses made a mockery out of that with a sentence 4,391 words long. The fact of the matter is Hemingway has been canonized and his minimized writing style had a huge impact on the next generations of writers. I cringe whenever I hear anyone say if there is a simpler word use it. This all said a writer does have a responsibility to write to their audience.   The One and Only Gertrude SteinHemingway had some...well... interesting conversations with Gertrude Stein. Stein for the record gives me the willies more so when she expresses her opinions. The Lost Generation, as this group of creative people in Paris were called, flocked to her door and fell at her feet. She commanded respect and if you did not give that respect you were not invited back. ”I had started this conversation and thought it had become a little dangerous. There were almost never paused and there were something she wanted to tell me and I filled my glass.‘You know nothing about any of this really, Hemingway,’ She said. ‘You’ve met known criminals and sick people and vicious people. The main thing is that the act male homosexuals commit is ugly and repugnant and afterwards they are disgusted with themselves. They drink and take drugs, to palliate this, but they are disgusted with the act and they are always changing partners and cannot be really happy.’‘I see.’‘In women it is the opposite. They do nothing that they are disgusted by and nothing that is repulsive and afterwards they are happy and they can lead happy lives together.’‘I see.’”I see. I see. I see.Hemingway also spent some time with Fitzgerald. His portrayal of F. Scott is not the most endearing, but then I have no illusions about Fitzgerald and his destructive lifestyle, in particular, his debilitating drinking. Hemingway did admire Scott’s writing.”His talent was as natural as the pattern that was made by the dust on a Butterfly’s wings. At one time he understood it no more than the butterfly did and he did not know when it was brushed or marred. Later he became conscious of his damaged wings and of their construction and he learned to think and could not fly any more because the love of flight was gone and he could only remember when it was effortless.”
  Ernest Hemingway (The Bull) and F. Scott Fitzgerald (The Butterfly).Hemingway becomes exasperated with the devastating influence that Zelda had on Fitzgerald’s life and writing. She wanted to drink, party, and be merry all the time. Zelda Sayre broke up with F. Scott after they became engaged. He was determined to become famous in an effort to win her back. He wrote This Side of Paradise and sent it out for consideration to publishers. The result: he lined the walls of his study with the rejection slips. After a third revision Maxwell Perkins went to bat for him and Scribners decided to publish. The book sold out in three days. It makes me wonder if F. Scott had never met Zelda would he have ever become a successful writer? She was his muse and his kryptonite. One thing I have discovered over the years in watching the relationship gymnastics of my friends is that we can not help who we fall in love with. It is mystical and sometimes makes no sense even to ourselves. 
  I’ve always liked this picture of the The Fitzgeralds.A source of contention between Zelda and F. Scott was that all those wonderful witty bits of dialogue that came out of her mouth ended up in his writing. She had literary aspirations herself and felt that he was stealing her best material. I wish I’d read this book when I was ni-ni-nin-teen because maybe I’d be a brilliant regional writer like Daniel Woodrell. (It could have been me being knocked silly on an episode of No Reservations with Anthony Bourdain.) If you do not know much about the Lost Generation and their time in Paris this isn’t a bad place to start. It will be a quick read and should lead to other books and a new found interest in a period of time when it felt like everything was possible and change wasn’t something to be feared. "
6603,I quattro accordi,Miguel Ruiz,4.12,114904,6314,Jim Mitchell,5,"I am reading this book, and even though it is a small book, when I finish page 129, I start over again on page 1. I have been reading it for about fourteen years now, and I suspect I will continue reading it for as long as I can read. A few pages at a time is more than enough to give me something to kick around in my head for a few days or a week. This is a book that challenges one to live up to four simple truths, and offers transformational results as a result if one could live a life completely engaged in the four agreements. They are so concise that I can state them here. 1) Be impeccable with your word. 2) Don't take anything personally. 3) Don't make assumptions. 4) Always do your best. Simple huh? Track a day and see how many times you break an agreement (in your actions or your mind). To my constant amazement, I find myself stumbling over one or another of these agreements with some regularity. So it helps to remind myself by the constant reread.I am not reading with a hope that I will attain some mystical state, but I read because I find the author's explanation of how our mind, our society, and importantly, our relationships work to be insightful, even though it is based on a paradigm that is completely outside my heritage of growing up in a small New England town. Understanding the Toltec dream metaphor is an essential part of realizing the deeper meaning driving our relationships within the world around us. Ruiz does a good job of helping these concepts become clearer.Reading this book, I have started to formulate a good answer to a question that originally began in childhood. ""What is the meaning of life?"" is not a good question to be unanswered when one has piled up decades in this mortal realm. Ruiz has helped me drop many of my limited belief structures and has opened up insights into living that are valuable to young and old souls alike.It is 2017, fourteen years after I wrote this first review, and the book is still on my nightstand by my bed. It is a good read."
5817,Lines of Flight: Discursive Time and Countercultural Desire in the Work of Thomas Pynchon,Stefan Mattessich,3.43,7,2,Magnus Ver Magnusson,5,"Nuff sed: ""What you felt stirring across the land... it was the equinox... green spring equal nights... canyons are opening up, at the bottom are steaming fumaroles, steaming the tropical life there like greens in a pot, rank, dope-perfume, a hood of smell... human consciousness, that poor cripple, that deformed and doomed thing, is about to be born. This is the World just before men. Too violently pitched alive in constant flow ever to be seen by men directly. They are meant only to look at it dead, in still strata, transputrefied to oil or coal. Alive, it was a threat: it was Titans, was an overpeaking of life so clangorous and mad, such a green corona about Earth's body that some spolier had to be brought in before it blew the Creations apart. So we, the crippled keepers, were sent out to multiply, to have dominion. God's spoilers. Us. Counter-revolutionaries. It is our mission to promote death. The way we kill, the way we die, being unique among the Creatures. It was something we had to work on, historically and personally. To build from scratch up to its present status as reaction, nearly as strong as life, holding down the green uprising. But only nearly as strong."""
2333,Farmer Giles of Ham ,J.R.R. Tolkien,3.82,5607,260,Bookdragon Sean ,4,"This is a great little tale full of bravery, heroism and Tolkien’s ever so subtle humour. Farmer Giles saves his farm and, as a consequence, the local village from a rampaging giant. This earns him a fierce reputation for heroism; thus, he is rewarded by the King with a rather glamourous sword. The King, believing this to be a mere ceremonial weapon, parts with the blade gladly. It turns out that the sword is actually Tailbiter, an ancient weapon that carries a powerful enchantment. Indeed, it cannot physically be sheathed when in close proximity to a dragon. Can you guess what happens next?A dragon appears! Bet you didn’t see that coming. He attacks the surrounding villages and there is little anyone can do to stop him. Naturally Farmer Giles is called upon for help, though he is very reluctant. He is old and who actually wants to fight dragons? His only act of heroism was defence of his own land, this is a different situation. He fears he may not be up to the task. But nonetheless due to the constant pestering of the villages, he resolves himself and hunts down the dragon. He opts to take a more tactical approach that the strutting knights of the realm:“Well,” said Giles,” if it is you notion to go dragon hunting jingling and dinging like Canterbury Bells it ain’t mine. It don’t seem sense to me to let a dragon to let a dragon know that you are coming along the road sooner than need be.”Giles has an interesting way of dealing with his problems. Instead of taking the predicted direction, the hack and slash route, he chooses a more careful approach. This in its self is a much more logical solution and leaves the tale going into unexpected directions. Instead of slaying the dragon he makes a deal with him and after forcing the dragon to complete his end of the bargain, they become unlikely friends. The dragon is bound to his service out of a respect for Giles and a fear of his sword. Trouble strikes when the King of the realm hears of the treasure Giles has taken for himself. He wants it for the crown, but why should Giles give his hard earned treasure away? He’s now friends with a dragon. Not much the King can do. So this was a fun tale; it’s definitely aimed at a younger audience, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. The ending was great, I do wish Tolkien has picked a more orginal name though for his hero. "
2512,Stover at Yale,Owen Johnson,3.69,48,7,El,3,"This story starts on the Yale campus as freshman Dink Stover arrives, bright-eyed and eager as all good early 20th-century undergrads do in fiction. He becomes aware of the secret societies of the campus, particularly the Skull and Bones. The story is not so much about campus life, per se, but about the politics of campus life, how to succeed in the campus societies, and really just how to make it to the top of the social ladder.I think maybe I would have enjoyed this if I had more testosterone. As it was I was sort of 'meh' about the whole thing. It didn't feel new, though probably because I've read Fitzgerald and I felt he did a relatively decent job of detailing the campus life. The Skull and Bones and others was a nice addition, however. Overall, though, I was bored by the sports talk (lots of football, some wrestling). I don't often think that if I were a male I might appreciate a story better, and this actually may have been the first time the thought crossed my mind.There is at least another book in the Stover saga, and perhaps if I had read the one about his Lawrenceville days first I might have enjoyed Yale a little better. Can't say I won't check out anything else by Johnson, but I'm certainly in no rush."

The most obvious of these is his antipathy toward female operatives, best illustrated by these quotes from the debriefing report:“And there was this pest of a girl. Women were for recreation. On a job, they got in the way and fogged things up with sex and hurt feelings and all the emotional baggage they carried around. One had to look out for them and take care of them.”And also:“These blithering women who thought that they could do a man’s work. Why the hell couldn’t they stay at home and mind their pots and pans and stick to their frocks and gossip and leave men’s work to the men.”Isn’t it patently obvious, sir, that such preconceived notions caused him to fall for the Target’s devious trap? However, he had subsequently paid dearly for such deplorable misogyny by suffering the worst kind of torture known to the male of the species --- a ghastly affair that involved a cane chair with cut out seat, a 3 foot long carpet beater and Agent 007’s naked nether regions --- the details of which is available in the medical report attached to Head of S’s memorandum.Further on, his psychological condition during the long convalescence led him to develop certain feelings for Miss Lynd, to the extent that he was prepared to propose marriage to her.

It is obvious from Miss Lynd’s unfortunate reaction that the feeling was mutual.Based on the aforementioned reasons, I propose that we keep Agent 007 in active duty as he had proved that he was able to overcome his personal weaknesses for the good of the Service. Besides, we now have incontrovertible proof that Agent 007 is irresistible to enemy females, a quality that might come handy in future missions that might require such ability.Signed: Second Officer Jane Moneypenny, WRNS.P.S. : Please disregard any insinuation from certain members of the Service (you know who they are, sir) that I have a ‘crush’ on James Agent 007.

77,The Control of Nature,John McPhee,4.24,3096,261,Greg,5,"If you asked me a week ago, or before I read this book, if I thought this would be a five star book I would have thought you were crazy. Her? This book? I would have probably told you I might never even read this book and that it made me bored to just read the copy on the back. And I can't even tell you why I started to read this. I was just sitting around my apartment, reading  Ladies and Gentlemen, The Bible!, and I had about thirty pages left and I got restless and it was still light out, actually it was about 7 pm, and it's summer so that meant I still had an hour or so of light, and it was nicer outside than it was in my stuffy apartment so I decided to go outside and read, but I got afraid that I'd zip through the not-so-hilarious re-tellings of bible stories and after standing in the middle of my apartment looking in every direction trying to figure out which book to read next, I just grabbed this one, I don't know why, partly because it was on one of my little cardboard shelves and it was easy to see from where I was standing and I thought I'm not going to care too much about this, I'll be able to give it away when I'm done! And it's only 272 pages long, with sort of big print! Let's go read  about the control of nature. But I was so young and foolish and stupid then, a week ago, last Sunday. This book is so good! I can't do any justice to the book by trying to explain what it is about. If you goto this edition of the book you can read a fairly good description of what the book is about: here!The easy response to just about any of the three stories that make up the basis for these essays (Man Versus The Mississippi River and it's natural inclination to 'move' to a more efficient route to the Gulf of Mexico and it's propensity to flood places like New Orleans, which is just asking for it; Man Versus slow moving lava and mountain (a fucking mountain, a moving fucking mountain on lava. And not an existing mountain, but a new mountain that didn't already exist, how awesome / twisted / mind bending is that? A big fissure opens in the ground, lava starts seeping out, big fire shit shoots into the sky some other geological stuff happens and from the side of a mountain comes another mountain that is moving and some guys with water pumps are trying to stop it) that are threatening to destroy a harbor on an Icelandic Island; and Man Versus millions of tons of rocks and boulders that come sliding off of mountains on the edge of Los Angeles when the conditions are right and destroy everything in their path), as I was saying, the easy response to these is 'well that's what you get for building / living there. But of course, like just about everything in life, when you start to find out more about the situation the easy response isn't so easy. Yeah, people don't need to have million dollar homes on the edge of mountains just waiting for the right combination of wildfire debris, big rains and loose ground from the very active mountains that are still in the process of rising to send rock slides, which can easily pull an automobile along with it, heading towards the expensive homes (and then these people, have the gall to try to sue for property damage they suffer, and sometimes apparently they even win (but sometimes rationality prevails and they don't and they are told, well you knew the risks)), but what do you do now that they are living there? And that they are living there and they are quite possibly extremely litigious? And then what do you think of the situation when you find out it's not just rich idiots living in those homes, but also pretty much the entire geology department of Cal Tech lives in this danger zone, the people who study what is going on here, and who know all of the dangers better than probably anyone else in the world, and they chose to live there. Can you imagine how great the area must be to knowingly risk having your home wiped out in seconds by raging rocks? My favorite part of the book was the Volcano essay that made up the center of the book. It was just amazing, and it didn't even need to rely on some of the silliness that Americans provide with their 'I'm going to sue you!' mentality that the very excellent ""Los Angeles Against the Mountains"" essay had going on it (it was very very good besides some of the silly stories). I don't know who is reading this right now, but you should read this essay, it's called ""Cooling the Lava"" and I can't put into words how great I thought it was. I'm sort of a bit in love with volcanos after reading it. I'll even cut this review short so that you can go find a copy of this book, or the essay and read it, and hopefully you wont think I steered you too wrong. The rest of this review would have just been gushing about how much I loved the book, or me saying something like ""why are people in Los Angeles so dumb?!?"", now go away and read the essay."
2182,Three Tales,Gustave Flaubert,3.73,3823,213,Seemita,3,"Ever wondered if stark realities of life were humans, how would they converse? What would death reveal to Satan which may surprise agony? What may joy surmise on pain that might recall God's support? What might greed and insanity bring to table worthy of discussion in peace's eyes? Where would loyalty stand should all others be permitted to share the same house?Flaubert embarks on a bold journey, by giving voice to these very boundless giants and drawing a territory around them by erecting three walls of formidable texture and strength, painted with magnanimous coats of deceptive prose and magnetic rhythm. Reverberating within their throes are three teeming groups of conversations - the unsettling yet hypnotizing exchange on continuity and termination between death and satan, the rising and falling chronicles of an assiduous man with a coal-black barbaric streak and the indefatigable affection of a gregarious maid towards her bountiful parrot. The stories have powerful mouthpieces and their innermost themes dance with vigor at Flaubert's deft call. One has to be a sworn cynic to deny Flaubert, his versatility and adroitness.But even the best architect in this world cannot lay claim (without sumptuous debate) on completeness of a house having chosen to withhold a fourth wall to his structure. The three walls, in this story, also could not undermine the importance of a fourth wall on my dwelling tastes. While the stories ran with unrestrained velocity, the stability that imparts gravitas to their colossal mass was missing. While I could sense Flaubert's great passion as a beaming halo behind his two characters, Julian in The Legend of Saint Julian the Hospitaller and Felicite in A Simple Soul, the characters themselves did not assume a life of their own despite their manifold perditions. Regard me with pessimism if you wish but my limited observations indicate that the greatest characters have risen from the flames of failures and damnations. And Flaubert's miserly shower of these redemptive pulses on his characters seemed like outright injustice to their etching.I wish I had peppered a prayer on my lips, standing by Julian's hours of penance; may be, straightened a few wrinkles on the fatigued brows of Felicite's loneliness. Alas! my empathies quietly escaped from the open space of this house. But not before taking the idiosyncrasies of loulou surreptitiously in my bag, who went on to adorn the chief mantle in Julian Barnes'  Flaubert's Parrot !"
229,Sideswipe,Charles Willeford,4.04,728,71,James Thane,4,"This is the third book in Charles Willeford's excellent series featuring Miami homicide detective Hoke Moseley. As the book opens, Hoke, although still only in his forties, wakes up to a full-blown mid-life crisis. He's completely unable to function irrespective of his responsibilities to his two teenage daughters who live with him, to his department, and to his partner, Ellita Sanchez, who is eight months pregnant (not by Hoke) and who also lives in Hoke's home.Unable to cope, Hoke takes a leave of absence from his job and retreats to Singer Island, where his wealthy father lives. He takes a job running a small apartment building for his father and swears that he will never leave the island again.In the meantime, Stanley Sinkiewicz, an elderly retiree who has moved to Florida from Detroit has a brush with the law and, although he is completely innocent, he is briefly forced to share a jail cell with a man claiming to be Robert Smith. ""Smith"" is really a psychopathic career criminal named Troy Louden. He has a gift for reading people and immediately pegs Stanley for the sad, lonely man he is at heart. Louden befriends Stanley, schooling him in the way to best deal with the authorities, and before long, Stanley is convinced that Troy is his new best friend. Louden is desperately hoping to have the charges against him dropped before a fingerprint check is returned and the police discover his real identity. To this end, he asks Stanley to do him a ""small favor"" once he is released, and, totally won over by his new buddy, the old man agrees. The ploy works and Louden, now free, enlists Stanley to help him pull off a big job he is planning.Meanwhile, Hoke Mosley is discovering that it's a lot harder to simplify his life than he had hoped. His father is determined to help him get a new job with the local police force, although Hoke has absolutely no interest in the job. His younger daughter joins him on the island further complicating matters, and the tenants in the apartment house generally prove to be a major pain in the butt.The Mosley story and the Stanley/Louden story proceed along parallel tracks and for a while the reader is left to wonder how Willeford is ever going to link them up. But it really doesn't matter because both stories are very entertaining.Willeford has populated this book with a number of unique and very interesting characters and between the lines, he has a great deal to say about the nature of family and about the workings of the capitalist system in the United States. All in all, it's a very entertaining book that should appeal to large numbers of readers."
232,I am Charlotte Simmons ,Tom Wolfe,3.4,21711,1904,Chad Wemyss,1,"""I am Tom Wolfe... "" and therefore I can write whatever I want. And people will still buy my over-long, thinly-developed, poorly-constructed tirade against 'kids these days.'It's called a stereotype, Tom. You should probably avoid making all your characters painfully simple cardboard cutouts of actual people. And I'm pretty sure I've seen all of these before, in EVERY movie and book about ""college"" ever produced.To inventory: - The main protagonist, the archetypical smart girl who's better looking than she realizes. - The big dumb jock who's smarter than he realizes - The beautiful-but-evil roommate - The nerdy reporter for the school paper - The obnoxious, privileged frat boy - And a whole host of minor supporting characters... as the secretary from Ferris Bueller put it, a cast of ""sportos, motorheads, geeks, sluts, bloods, waistoids, dweebies, and d!ckheads."" Along with rednecks, the new england rich, and a smattering of other cellophane-thin stereotypes.This book isn't quite satire, it isn't quite commentary, isn't remotely insightful, but it is awfully long. It has that going for it."
8212,The Impostor Phenomenon: Overcoming the Fear That Haunts Your Success,Pauline Rose Clance,4.19,21,4,Jon Mackley,5,"I heard about the Imposter Phenomenon a few years ago. It's the concept that you don't deserve the success you've achieved. Many of us are bad at taking compliments, but it's also the fear of being ""found out"" (imagine you've been diligent in doing a degree, but somehow feel that you're a fraud). Likewise, when I bought my first and only house, I wandered around thinking ""I don't deserve this"". It's been incredibly useful to read about different examples of IP - many people will suffer from more than one example. The book also gives examples of HOW this behaviour may have been learned, as well as strategies on how to break the habit."
5255,"Collected Stories, 1891-1910",Edith Wharton,4.27,48,6,"Captain Sir Roddy, R.N. (Ret.)",5,"I recently finished reading Hermione Lee's excellent biography of Edith Wharton, and decided to go back and read most of Edith Wharton's short stories again. It had been several years since I'd sat down and carefully read her stories, and the two-volume Library of America collections are simply superb. They contain most of the her stories and are arranged chronologically in the order in which she wrote them. Edith Wharton may be the very best author of short stories that I've yet encountered, and I think that most readers will enjoy each and every one of them. Some are down-right creepy, some are satirical, others are sad, but all touch on the human experience. Favorites in this first volume include ""The Touchstone"", ""Souls Belated"", ""Sanctuary"", and many others. Frankly, there really isn't a bad story in the whole lot. Wharton is such an intelligent writer and was able to turn her sharp eye on the society around her and somehow seamlessly translate that vision to the printed page to the delight of her readers past, present, and future."
8069,Pickles To Pittsburgh: The Sequel To Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs,Judi Barrett,3.71,1114,112,Lisa Vegan,4,"I recently read Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs for the very first time, and I wanted to read this book too, even though my expectations were very low because I’d seen & heard others’ opinions of it, and overall they’re not that enthusiastic. Perhaps this is why I ended up enjoying this book, and being so pleasantly surprised by it. No, it’s not as brilliants as the first (famous) book, but I thought it was fun too.I like the social responsibility message (despite it being a fantasy), I love the children being so close to their grandfather and the multi-generational family, and, once again, I liked the food, huge and outlandish and out of place, though the premise here is not as funny as the first book’s and it’s also no longer so unique. Also, this book does not really work perfectly as a standalone book; it’s definitely a sequel. However, as long as readers’ expectations are not too high, if they’ve enjoyed the first book, I think they’ll be interested to see what happens next."
3957670,Italian Villas And Their Gardens,Edith Wharton,3.93,46,8,Sarah,3,"Italian Villas and Their Gardens details a history in Italian garden development. The book was first published in 1904 and includes some illustrations. The Italian garden is constructed of paths, hedges, fountains and grottos. Colour and flowers are secondary in the scheme, whilst statuary, vines, foliage and structure play a major role. Order and function is an important criteria for the Italian garden and gardens are seen as an extension of the villa. They include 'garden rooms' for walking, thinking and relaxing. It was interesting to read about a different style of gardening. I did feel that I would have liked a more personal style to the writing. My garden is very different. I love the cottage garden style with lots of flowers in a more natural setting."
5910,The Annotated Hobbit,J.R.R. Tolkien,4.25,2218108,38084,Matt,5,"Some books are almost impossible to review. If a book is bad, how easily can we dwell on its flaws! But if the book is good, how do you give any recommendation that is equal the book? Unless you are an author of equal worth to the one whose work you review, what powers of prose and observation are you likely to have to fitly adorn the work? 'The Hobbit' is at one level simply a charming adventure story, perhaps one of the most charming and most adventurous ever told. There, see how simple that was? If you haven't read it, you should, because it is quite enjoyable. At some level, there is little more to say. Enjoy the story as the simple entertainment it was meant to be. Read it to your children and luxuriate in the excitement and joy that shines from their faces. That's enough.But if it was only simple entertainment, I do not think that it would be anything more than just a good book. Instead, this simple children's story resonates and fascinates. It teases and hints at something larger and grander, and it instructs and lectures as from one of the most subtle intellects without ever feeling like it is instructing, lecturing or being condescending.At its heart, the complaint I opened the review with is just a variation on one of the many nuanced observations Tolkien makes in 'The Hobbit' when he complains that a story of a good time is always too quickly told, but a story of evil times often requires a great many words to cover the events thereof. How often has that idea fascinated me.Consider also how the story opens, with Bilbo's breezy unreflective manners which are polite in form but not in spirit, and Gandalf's continual meditation on the meaning of 'Good morning.’ How much insight is concealed within Gandalf's gentle humor! How often do we find ourselves, like Bilbo, saying something we don't really mean and using words to mean something very unlike their plain meaning! How often do we find ourselves saying, ""I don't mean to be rude, but..."", when in fact we mean, ""I very much mean to be rude, and here it comes!"" If we did not mean to be rude, surely we wouldn't say what we say. Instead we mean, ""I'm going to be rude but I don't want you to think I'm someone who is normally rude..."", or ""I'm going to put myself forward, but I don't want you to think of me as someone who is normally so arrogant..."", or even, ""I'm going to be rude, but I don't want to think of myself as someone who is rude, so I'm going to pretend I'm not being rude...""I think that is what makes this more than just a good book, but a great one. Tolkien is able to gently skewer us for our all too human failings, and he does so without adopting any of the cynicism or self-loathing so common with those that seek out to skewer humanity for its so evident failings. We fantasize about heroes which are strong and comely of form, and we have for as long as we've had recorded literature. Our comic books are filled with those neo-pagan mythic heroes whose exaggerated human virtues always amount to, whatever else may be true of them, 'beats people up good'. These modern Ajaxs, Helens and Achilles dominate the box office, and I would imagine dominate our internal most private fantasy lives as well. Oh sure, the superhero of our fantasy might have superhuman ethics to go along with his superhuman ability to kick butt, attract the opposite sex, and enforce their will upon others, but it is always attached to and ultimately secondary to our fantasy of power and virility. How different is Tolkien's protagonist from Heracles, Lancelot, Beowulf, or Batman - short, small, mundane, and weak. Of all the principal characters of the story, he possesses probably the least of that quintessential heroic attribute - martial prowess.And yet, he is not actually merely an 'average Joe'. Bilbo is just as much an exaggerated idealized hero as Heracles, it's just that those attributes in which Bilbo is almost transcendently inhuman isn't the sort of attributes we normally fantasize about having ourselves. Bilbo is gentle. He is simple. He is humble. Power and wealth have little attraction for him. He is kind. He takes less than his share, and that that he takes he gives away. He is a peacemaker. Though wrongly imprisoned, he bears no grudge and desires no vengeance for the wrongs done to him. Rather he apologizes for stealing food, and offers to repay in recompense far more than he took. Though mistreated, he harbors no enmity. He never puts himself forward, but he never shirks when others do. How often do we fantasize about being this different sort of hero, and yet how much better we would be if we did? How much better off would we be if we, like Thorin could declare in our hearts, ""There is more in you of good than you know, child of the kindly West. Some courage and some wisdom, blended in measure. If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world."" How often is it that we hunger after all the wrong things? What profit would we really have if we had in great measure the power to 'beat people up good'? What real use could we put it too? How much better off would we be individually and as a people if we most desired to be graced with Bilbo's virtues, rather than Achilles speed, strength, and skill with arms? How much less mature does this mere children's book of a well lit-world cause our darker fantasies to seem?Now, I admit I am biased in my review. I read this book 36 times before the age of 16. I broke the spines of three copies of it with continual reading. Yet in my defense I will say that I'm considered only a moderate fan of the book by many. I've known several devotees of the book who, like the protagonist of Bradbury's 'Fahrenheit 451', can recite whole chapters from memory - ensuring that this would be one of the few books that would survive the sudden destruction of all the world's technology if only the world's story tellers survived. If you are inclined to think no book can be that good, and that my review overhypes it, so much the better. Go in with low expectations so as to be certain that they will be met or exceeded. Forget all I have said save that, ""If you haven't read it, you should, because it is quite enjoyable."""
5254,A Son at the Front,Edith Wharton,3.45,150,18,Duane,4,"Edith Wharton lived in Paris during World War I, and with her incredible talent she paints a picture of the city and the people, and how they adapted to the the changes the war imposed on everyone and everything. One young man goes off to war and his parents pride for his bravery and horrible fear that he may not return is a scene played out countless times with families everywhere. Wharton was a correspondent and a homefront volunteer and her insights and descriptions give the reader a feel for the emotions of the time and the people who lived through it."
5259,Sanctuary,Edith Wharton,3.42,599,55,Stela,3,"For a modernist author, Edith Wharton is actually very traditional in Sanctuary, which is written almost like a classical work: with compositional equilibrium and morale and care for the metaphor. However, the novella isn’t pedantic (I don’t think there is a work of Edith Wharton that could be accused of this) and not even the theme – the power of education - would make you think so. Shortly, this is the story of a young girl whose illusions about “happily ever after” are shattered just before her wedding, by learning that her fiancé not only did a blamable thing, but he is unable to see the evil in what he did, and neither does her father who seems to think too that such things are meant to be rather hidden and forgotten than assumed and dealt with. So Kate Orme makes a surprising decision: instead of cancelling the wedding she decides to go ahead with it in order to prevent Dennis to marry another woman and have children who will behave like him. In other words, she takes upon herself to save the world, to build a sanctuary that will protect the next generation against the evil the society not only accepts bur even encourages. And this sanctuary is the education she envisages for her children.Part 2 shows a widowed Kate with a grown-up child. She succeeded in teaching her son to disregard material rewards but is aware of his incapacity of accepting failure. And here comes a turning point, when Dick is lured by another inheritance (there is a deliberate parallelism between him and his father here) to forget the values his mother tried to inoculate him, and he is conflicted because both his professional future and his future happiness depend on his decision. But in the end, although he had tried to turn his back on his mother's teaching and see things from another perspective, all he had been taught takes over and wins the inner fight:""His hands stole back into hers, and he leaned his head against her shoulder like a boy.""I'm an abysmally weak fool, you know,"" he ended; ""I'm not worth the fight you've put up for me. But I want you to know that it's your doing—that if you had let go an instant I should have gone under—and that if I'd gone under I should never have come up again alive.""""I know, it seems infinitely boring and irritatingly educational. Additionally, Kate is not a character easy to like - she seems lifeless like an annoying concept, rigid in her beliefs and incredibly egotistical and limited sometimes. But keep in mind this is Edith Wharton we are talking about – a younger one, true, but gifted nonetheless, so the story somehow sounds right and is worth reading since it announces her masterpieces.

7229,The Inner Voice of Love,Henri J.M. Nouwen,4.43,3570,237,Brad Syverson,5,"This is a book to be read and absorbed in small doses. It is a deeply personal and very honest book written during a time of great pain. But it is a hopeful book. It's as though Nouwen is writing to himself from place of hope. My sense is that, through effective advice and sheer force of will, Nouwen imagined a place of hope from which he could write to himself sitting in despair. From this imagined place, Nouwen looks back and sees a path to wholeness, a path to an existential, a real place of hope.As is the case with all truths, there is no chronological to do list that gets you there. Instead, there are markers, guideposts, lodestars. By careful reading and thougtful discernment, we can benefit fromthese markers, guideposts and lodestarts to find our own path to wholeness."
857,Web Standards Solutions: The Markup and Style Handbook (Pioneering Series),Dan Cederholm,4.07,309,11,Craig Cecil,5,"Noted web standards guru Dan Cederholm (of SimpleBits fame) presents sixteen chapters devoted to the effective and optimal use of XHTML markup followed by advanced CSS techniques layered upon that markup. While much of this information has been covered before and will be familiar to intermediate and advanced XHTML coders, several of the CSS chapters are real eye-openers, even for advanced technicians. For example, in Chapter 11: Print Styles, Cederholm discusses an extremely effective technique for allowing the user to switch between alternative layouts of your page (two-column, three-column) without the need for a round-trip to the server. And Chapter 15: Styling  sounds innocent enough, but presents a technique that allows the developer to provide some basic Content Management System (CMS) functionality as applied to web templating. It's a short book (238 pages), and quick read, but may prove indispensible from a design, productivity, and business perspective. Highly recommended. "
856,The Trust: The Private and Powerful Family Behind The New York Times,Susan E. Tifft,3.93,135,17,Bap,3,"Aldolph Ochs arrived in New York from Chattanoga and managed by bluster to secure ownership of the NY Times and turn it to the best newspaper in the country. The ownership has passed from father to son with son in laws stepping in when no sons were available. Hence the Sulzbergers.This is an entertaining, gossipy account but the history of the paper and significance of the paper, its great reporters. and columnists is totally subordinated to tales of the family which isn't all that interesting. The coverage of the turbulent 12 years of the paper's struggle with New York Typographical Union is so incomplete and shoddy that one must wonder about how reliable the rest of the book is.The book ends in 1999 which is unfortunate because the last decade has been a disaster for newspapers in general and the NYTimes in particular and one wonders whether newsprint, hard copy newspapers are a business model that can continue to exist for another twenty years.Read the book, the Paper an account of the Herald Tribune which is far more impressive."
7231,The Dance of Life: Weaving Sorrows and Blessings Into One Joyful Step,Henri J.M. Nouwen,4.21,116,11,Seth,4,"This is a tough one to ""rate;"" it's kind of a greatest hits of sorts, essentially comprised of miniature, fun sized segments of Nouwen's thoughts. That said, ""fun sized"" usually leaves something to be desired, and it's a bit of a tease to shift focus as rapidly as this collection does, never fully developing any one idea to its finality (that is, pretending that finality of an idea actually exists...work with me here). It has sent me off on a mission to scavenge some actual complete Nouwen texts, though. An excellent introduction to a prolific contemplative."
7453,Same Sex in the City,Lauren  Levin,3.56,376,38,erica fry,1,"worst. book. ever. so awful, in fact, that i read it in an afternoon and returned it to the bookstore the next morning because i couldn't put it on my bookshelf. as i no longer have the book, i'm unable to quote directly, although certain passages are seared into my memory. the gist of the book is this: we are really cute and femme, we were popular in high school, and men hit on us. being a lesbian is hawt, not to mention trendy. we're not like other lesbians who don't wear makeup and have bad fashion sense, and you don't have to be either. it's gonna be a little awkward at first, but we're here to talk you through it. if you're not yet experienced with the ladies, it's best to start when you're away from home on vacation (we both did), preferably in a booze-infused environment. if you see a woman you'd like to make out with, but are too embarrassed to make the first move, have one of your guy friends dare the two of you to do it. this is a hot idea for at least two reasons: #1 people think it's sexy and will want to watch, #2 if you decide later that it wasn't a great decision you can blame it on being drunk or use the what-happens-in-acapulco-stays-in-acapulco excuse.the authors (the laurens) claim this is a book about loving women, however the subtext is as anti-woman as any issue of maxim/blender/fhm/stuff, presented in a faux-feminist queer friendly package."
7228,Return of the Prodigal Son,Henri J.M. Nouwen,4.38,12375,702,Roger Brunyate,4,"Coming HomeThe Return of the Prodigal Son, 1636The Return of the Prodigal Son, 1642The Return of the Prodigal Son, 1668I was trained as an art historian, so I tend to look at Rembrandt's three versions of the parable of the Return of the Prodigal Son in terms of the artist's stylistic evolution: the baroque energy of the etching made when the artist was 30, the moving simplicity of the pen and wash drawing done six years later, and his final version, painted only a few months before he died, portraying the reunion of father and son almost as a holy ritual. This was certainly the impression of Dutch theologian Henri Nouwen in 1983, when he first saw the painting—actually only the left-hand side of it—blown up as a poster in a colleague's room. He immediately saw it in terms of God the Father receiving the repentant sinner, feeling that it was speaking directly to him. A year later, on a trip to Russia, he spent two days in front of the picture at the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg (now taking in also the watchers at the right-hand side), and continued to think and write about it for the next four years. During this time, he would give up his post at Harvard, go into retreat for a year, then take up a post as chaplain to the L'Arche Daybreak community in Toronto, a center for the mentally handicapped. His has been a long spiritual journey.There are many reasons why I should not have liked this book. I tend to read only fiction and to stay away from memoir. My training in art history urges me towards objective analysis, rather than believing that the picture has a subjective message for me. And most importantly, although I was brought up as a Christian, I rejected that faith in my late teens, whereas Nouwen is a Catholic priest of a strikingly evangelical bent, and makes no bones about talking of God as though of a personal acquaintance: Jesus has made it clear to me that the same voice that he heard at the River Jordan and on Mount Tabor can also be heard by me. He has made it clear to me that just as he has his home with the Father, so do I.And yet, if this were a novel about a man struggling with major decisions in his inner life, I would lap it up, much like Marilynne Robinson's Home. Even more so, perhaps, if the religion were Judaism, Buddhism, or Islam, since I would accept it as a belief that I personally have never shared, rather than seeing it as a reproach to the young man I no longer am. And Nouwen writes very personally indeed. He is always there as a human being, as a man given to anger, arrogance, friendship, and devotion, and as a son in real life who has missed opportunities to tell his own father of his love.I tend to be cautious about reading too much of an artist's life-story into his work, and Nouwen cautions himself against doing too much of this also. But nonetheless, he makes a great deal of Rembrandt as a prodigal son himself. A brash young man who set out with the world his oyster, he took the art world by storm before he was scarcely out of his teens. He made money and squandered money. But, as Nouwen writes, ""during his sixty-three years, Rembrandt saw not only his dear wife Saskia die, but also three sons, two daughters, and the two women with whom he lived."" He was to lose all his money, declare bankruptcy, and never again be entirely free from debt. He had…
  …lived a life marked by great self-confidence, success, and fame, followed by many losses, disappointments, and failures. Through it all he had moved from the exterior light to the interior light, from the portrayal of external events to the portrayal of inner meanings, from a life full of things and people to a life marked by solitude and silence. With age, he grew more interior and still. It was a spiritual homecoming,
What Nouwen says about Rembrandt's interior light is not merely poetic whimsy; it can be seen quite clearly in his late paintings. He is also implying that while the artist may have started out as the prodigal son, he ended up as the father. The old man in the picture is one of the artist's great studies of old age, on a par with his own late self-portraits, such as the one in London's National Gallery below, painted in the year of his death. But what I find so moving is that while the artist looks out with enquiring eyes, as though the world still hold mysteries that he has not solved, the father in the Prodigal Son painting is at least partially blind; he now sees with the inner eye.Self-Portrait, 1669Rembrandt starts as the prodigal and ends as the father. The moment he saw that poster, Nouwen identified himself with the errant son. But in thinking about the picture, seeing it in full in Saint Petersburg, and talking to friends who may have known him better than he knew himself, he was persuaded that there was a lot of the elder son in him too: the dutiful, self-satisfied Pharisee who kept to the law and dismissed those who didn't. That realization involved a painful journey into humility. Later still, he was persuaded that the most difficult task of all was to make himself worthy of becoming the father, in his own ministry and in his understanding of his relationship with God. Let's hear him in his own words:
When, four years ago, I went to Saint Petersburg to see Rembrandt's The Return of the Prodigal Son, I had little idea how much I would have to live what I then saw. I stand with awe at the place where Rembrandt brought me. He led me from the kneeling, disheveled young son to the standing, bent-over old father, from the place of being blessed to the place of blessing. As I look at my own aging hands, I know that they have been given to me to stretch out toward all who suffer, to rest upon the shoulders of all who come, and to offer the blessing that emerges from the immensity of God's love.
The book is dedicated to the author's own father, for his ninetieth birthday."
8910,The Second World War: A Complete History,Martin  Gilbert,4.16,957,42,booklady,5,"Gilbert does a great job with an extremely difficult subject. He is factual but not graphic. And yet the horrors of this war are practically endless. Millions upon millions of lives. Ironically we finished on the 71st anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima. July 6, 2016: This was an excellent if sobering listening choice for dear husband and myself this past July 4th weekend. It was good to recall and give thanks for the debt owed to so many for our sacred freedom. It left both of us overwhelmed, certainly not for the first time, at the horrors which we human beings are capable of against each other. Lest we ever forget..."
8919,The Invisible Man,H.G. Wells,3.62,97511,3799,Anne,4,"This is the story of how one angry, naked, sneezing albino managed to terrorize the English countryside. To be quite honest, I expected a bit more from the people who single-handedly fended off the Nazis. But Wells seemed to think his fellow countrymen would be a bit too inept to toss a sheet over the shivering bastard and punch him in the throat. Instead?This:Attention:1) There may be spoilers for this 100+ year old book in the review.2) Only comment if you have a WORKING sense of humor.3) Seriously. Read # 2 again before you correct my review.When I first started reading, I assumed that The Invisible Man would be about a guy who was slowly driven mad by this unusual condition.Nope.He was a world class douchebag long before embarking on his experiment to become see-through. Although, if I had to point out one major difference between his beginning vs. his end? Well, I'm guessing his dick & balls hadn't permanently retreated into his body before he became the World's Meanest Nudist.Really, dude? Really? Winter is not kind to nekkid folks. As every Mad Scientist will tell you, you've got to plan ahead. Mother Nature will not bend to your nefarious whims! Turn on the Weather Channel next time, moron.So, Griffin (that's the Invisible Man's name) discovers a magic not magic formula that allows his molecules to have fewer surfaces for light to refract off, and if he combines that with electrocuting not electrocuting himself with some sort of a radio wave contraption, he will become invisible.Pseudo-science, FTW! He tested it out on a cat, and it sorta worked. Except for the cat's eyes. Don't worry, though. The cat is fine! Not really. It's probably dead.One thing I found interesting was that until his body absorbed food, it remained visible. Which led me to spend quite a bit of my afternoon thinking about whether or not you could see his poop moving through his intestines. And if it did remain visible, that meant his Kryptonite could quite literally be cheese! Think about it, people. You could track him if he's constipated!Ha! I'll bet those assholes at MENSA are totally rethinking that rejection letter now.Yeah, so all they had to do was get a big cauldron (or Fry-Daddy) bubbling with oil, and then cook up a shit ton of mozzarella sticks. If placed strategically around the village, they could have had Griffin backed up and praying for prunes in no time. Between the groaning and visibly distended intestines, it would have been Problem Solved within two days. BOOM!Ok, so Wells does his dead-level best to make invisibility seem like a curse, but the reality was this was an AWESOME power. He's fucking invisible!The only reason Griffin wasn't immediately the richest man in the kingdom, was due to his a-hole personality. All he had to do was tell people about his amazing discovery! Instead, he shoots himself in the dick trying to keep it a secret. Sure, the people in that first hillbilly town might not have been receptive. At least, not at first, anyway...Witchcraft! Kill it with fire, Cletus!But show up at a Science Fair (or wherever smart people hang out), and he would have been carried off on his peers' weak & nerdy shoulders!I mean, his buddy Kemp was thoroughly impressed...until he started voluntarily boasting about his somewhat ill-thought-out crimes, and revealing his idiotic plans for world domination. Which, by the way, was the least well-planned villain plot...ever...in the history of badly planned villain plots!Terror? A reign of  terror? That's it?! What's the endgame, Griffin?Give me all your money! Or Terror!Make me king of the world! Or Terror!WTF, man? I think you're overestimating yourself a bit there...Sure, it's a bit spooky that you can't be seen, but, eventually, even the stupidest of villagers will band together & figure out that you can be taken down by a dog with a good nose...or cheese!Which is pretty much what happens.Except for the part about cheese. If only they had consulted someone with my level of genius intellect, poor Adye would still be alive. Tsk.He stupidly tries to implement his Reign of Terror, and manages to get a few good shots in, but eventually becomes the recipient of the ass beating of a lifetime.Moral of the story: Even if you're a genius, don't be a dick.You will inevitably freeze your balls off, catch a nasty cold, and end up bludgeoned to death by people with half your intellect.

7451,Confessions of an Economic Hit Man,John Perkins,3.84,26568,3059,شريف,4,"كتاب ممتاز وهو أحد الكتب المفضله لدي بلا جدال .. هو عبارة عن مذكرات قرصان إقتصادي دولي .. ويحكي الرجل تجربته مع هذه الوظيفة.يتحدث الرجل عن أنه بينما لجأت القوى القديمة (بريطانيا وفرنسا) للإحتلال العسكري المكلف مادياً وبشرياً؛ نهجت الولايات المتحدة نهج مختلف تماماً وهو ما عرف بـ(سياسة الإحتواء الإقتصادي) والتي تتلخص في مبدأ بسيط جداً ألا وهو إستخدام الموئسسات الدولية مثل ""البنك الدولي"" في تقديم مساعدات إقتصادية وقروض إعمار لدول العالم الثالث مقابل أن تقوم الشركات الأمريكية بتنفيذ المشروعات الكبرى في الدولة المستدينة مثل محطات طاقة ومطارات وشبكات طرق وشبكات إتصالات؛ وفي الوقت الذي تستدين هذه الدول من البنك الدولي تكون فوائد القروض أكبر من قدرة هذه الدول على السداد ومن ثم تتراكم فوائد القروض وتعجز هذه الدول عن السداد. هنا تتدخل الولايات المتحدة ""لمساعدة"" هذه الدول مقابل قواعد عسكرية أمريكية على أراضي هذه الدولة أو لتمرير قرارات معينه في مجلس الأمن أو القيام بإصلاحات إقتصادية داخلية معينه (خصخصة القطاع العام، الضريبة العقارية، الكويز، .. الخ) تساهم في زيادة الطين بللاً. بهذا يكون البنك الدولي فاز بفوائد القرض وفازت الشركات بأموال عقود الإعمار وفازت الولايات المتحدة بالسيطرة السياسية على الدولة المستدينة ولا يوجد خاسر في هذه اللعبة سوى المستدين. تكرر هذا الأمر في دول كثيرة جداً مما يطرح سؤالاً مهما؛ لماذا تستدين هذه الدول أصلاً؟؟عملت سياسة الإنجليز (المستعمر القديم) على تنصيب ما يسمى بالواجهة المحلية في الحكم. هذه الواجهة تظل في الحكم مادامت محافظة على مصالح الاستعمار وعندما تفشل في الحفاظ عليه يتم التنكيل بها كما حدث مع (نورويجا في بنما؛ صدام حسين في العراق؛ مبارك في مصر) وبالتالي فموافقة صانعي القرار في الدول الصغرى على الاستدانة بقروض لن تحتاج اليها دولهم لن يصبح مشكلة كبيرة لأن هذه الواجهة المحلية تدين ببقائها في السلطة للولايات المتحدة؛ مما يعني أنها ستوافق على أي قرض ما دامت الولايات المتحدة أمرت به. وللعجب فبينما جلست لكتابة هذه السطور قرأت عن إحباط القوات الأمريكية لمحاولة إنقلاب القوات المسلحة القطرية على الواجهة المحلية ""حمد بن جاسم"" وذلك لأن الرجل يسير وفق المخطط الأمريكي الكبير بمنتهى الدقة ولا داعي لإستبداله الآن للتدليل على نظرية الإحتواء الإقتصادي دعونا ننظر لبلد وقعت في براثن الإحتواء الإقتصادي بنفس الأسلوب .. في آواخر ستينات القرن الماضي تم إكتشاف إحتياطي كبير للنفط في ""إندونيسيا"" وفوراً أصدرت الإدارة الأمريكية الأوامر للشركات الأمريكية العملاقة بضرورة إحتواء إندونيسيا بأي ثمن حتى لا تقع في قبضة المعسكر الشيوعي بكل ما تملكه من إمكانيات نفطيه هائله. توجه مسئولين من هذه الشركات لمقابلة صانعي القرار في إندونيسيا لتقديم عروض بتجديد شبكة الكهرباء وبناء محطات طاقة جديدة تساعد على بناء المزيد من المطارات والطرق والمصانع وإحداث نهضة إقتصادية في إندونيسيا وعرض المسئولين في هذه الشركات ""التوسط"" لدى البنك الدولي لتسهيل هذه القروض. قامت الشركات الأمريكية بوضع توقعات أحمال طاقة عالية جداً تفوق حاجة إندونيسيا الفعلية؛ فالحقيقة أن أحمال الكهرباء التي كانت تكفي لم تكن تتعدي الـ 8% من قدرة الشبكة ولكن الشركات قدرت الأحمال المتوقعة بـ 20% حتى تزيد قيمة القرض ولم تمض أكثر من 5 سنوات شهدت فيها إندونيسيا طفرة بالفعل ولكن حين جاء ميعاد تحصيل الفوائد هرعت إندونيسيا لأمريكا طالبة العون. هنا قبلت أمريكا أن تساعد إندونيسا على التدخل لدى البنك الدولي لجدولة الديون في مقابل الحصول على عقد إحتكار للشركات الأمريكية للتنقيب عن البترول في الأراضي الإندونيسية. وبهذا تم نقل مال القرض من خزانة البنك الدولي الى مصارف نيويورك و واشنطن وحصل البنك الدولي على الفوائد فيما حصلت الولايات المتحدة على البترول وفازت الشركات بأموال القرض التي ستصب مباشرة في خانة الإقتصاد الأمريكي. وهكذا تم نهب ثروات إندونيسيا على الرغم من أنه كان بلداً واعداً جداً ذو مستقبل مشرق.وتستمر المأساة مع الجميع .. وفي الكتاب نمازج أكثر وقاحة منها مثلا تدخل عسكري مباشر في كل من بنما والعراق لتوريد عقود إعادة إعمار تساهم في رفع حالة الإقتصاد المتهاوي للولايات المتحدة الكتاب مهم جدا .. إقرأوه بالله عليكم :)"
8913,LIFE: World War II: History's Greatest Conflict in Pictures,Richard B. Stolley,4.38,69,4,Anton Klink,3,"This is no doubt an interesting photo album but suffers from having been written from the winner's point of view in a very obvious manner plus almost half of the book covers the US involvement in the Pacific and the war with Japan, which is quite disproportionate considering the whole of World War 2.Firstly, the winner's point of view is evident in too many photo captions. Whereas all the Allied soldiers in the pictures are always described as ""brave"", ""victorious"" or ""heroic"", the Axis soldiers depicted doing the exact same things as the Allies soldiers (storming into battle or crash-landing in burning planes) are for some reason always ""doomed"", ""frenzied"" or ""desperate"". I found that slant quite distasteful.Secondly, whereas half of the book is dedicated to the USA fighting the Japanese in the Pacific, this disproportionate coverage becomes evident when one compares the 100 000 US military losses against Japan with the 10 million Soviet military losses against Germany (who itself also lost around 6 million soldiers). The US suffered less than 1% of the casualties of what the Russians suffered against the Germans, so dedicating half the book to events covering that 1%, while leaving the other half to deal with all the rest is not very balanced in my opinion.Probably the culmination of this bias is the two-page coverage of a World War 2 ace fighter pilot. Was it Erich Hartmann, who had 352 confirmed air kills? Or any of the 100 Luftwaffe pilots, who had more than 100 kills? Or the best Japanese pilot, who had 90 kills or the best Soviet one, who had 60? Of course not - the only fighter pilot introduced in detail was the top-scoring US pilot Richard Bong, who had 40 kills. Sure, he was and probably will remain the top-scoring US fighter pilot of all time and I am sure he was an incredible pilot - but if you were to choose just one pilot from the whole war to feature, why would you chose someone, who wasn't even in the top 200? The only possible answer is because he is from the US, never mind the fact that his 40 kills is absolutely dwarfed by the mind-blowing feats of Erich Hartmann with his 352 kills or any of the 16 Luftwaffe pilots who amassed 200+ kills.Granted, this is a book produced in the US and many of the photos are by LIFE photographers, so a slight US slant would be understandable and acceptable. However, for a book that claims to cover the whole war and which even in its introduction touts that rare photos were researched and found from all over the world (Germany, Japan, Russia, Italy etc), it is unfortunate that we see and learn so little of the crucial battles fought in North Africa, Russia and Europe and are saturated with coverage of the Pacific theatre, which was essentially just a side-show compared to what was going on in Europe at the time.The essays introducing each year by eminent authors are succinct and to the point, though of a somewhat uneven quality and once again slanted heavily towards the US involvement. The ""Then and Now"" sections presenting the influence of WW2 on life today is a good idea in theory but in practice it falls flat. Had the editors of the book kept to their original goal of showing us incredible photos from 1938-1945, those war-time photos would have made the book timeless and enduring. However, to illustrate their ""Then and Now"" essays, we are also shown various photos from the 90s and even 2001, which really have no place in the book. In fact, the unintended consequence of these more ""modern"" photos is that they make the book look incredibly dated instead.I honestly expected more out of this book. It is still an excellent photo album and a passable overview of WW2, however be prepared for a disproportionate coverage of the Pacific theatre and it really doesn't do justice to the intended goal of covering the whole of World War 2."
8912,World War II for Kids: A History with 21 Activities,Richard Panchyk,4.12,81,6,Sarah,4,"This book looks like a great resource for kids to read about WWII and it seems to cover all aspects of the war in a great overview. There are helpful maps and a timeline at the beginning. What I really love are the ""activities with a purpose"". Some of the activities include ""Make a Ration Kit"" (for soldiers), ""Know Your Ranks"", ""Stage a Radio Adventure Program"", ""Rationing Game"" (where you calculate how much food your family would actually need - there's a lot of great math involved!), and ""Coastal Defense"" - all of these activities look really impressive and so meaningful. As a historian who loves studying this era, this book gets me really excited. I think I'm going to have to buy it. I'm putting 4 stars based on flipping through it alone and I'll come back later for a more complete review."
904,The Game Maker's Apprentice: Game Development for Beginners,Jacob Habgood,3.97,118,13,David,5,"Do you have a junior high / high school kid that you want to get interested in programming? Yes? Then stop what you’re doing, download GameMaker (for Windows or Mac), and order this book!My 13 year old son and I have nearly finished working our way through this book over his summer vacation. All of the examples turn into compelling, fully playable games. While the learning curve will appear to stretch to the horizon, it’s a gentle steady slope, with fun and results at each stage. The majority of the book teaches real programming concepts, but without using traditional code. Code is introduced towards the end of the book, and it used throughout the sequel ‘The Game Maker’s Companion’.While I wanted him to have immediate success, I also wanted him to encounter and learn to track down bugs, since that’s part of the process. He’s certainly made enough bugs of his own, but we only managed to find two in the book itself (in one case, the book is out of date – p12 shows the old way of handling sprite strips, but a quick check on YouTube showed the new way to do it).Ready? It's time for my “get off my lawn” rant. :)I’m 42 now. It was 1984 when I was my son’s age, and 8-bit computers had begun to appear in homes. Back then, writing code was a necessary path to having fun with a computer, where as now, it’s (at least initially) a barrier to fun.In those days, a nation of code-writing kids helped define the next great industry, and it happened when most adults weren't paying much attention. I was one of ~30 million Commodore 64 owners who knew that the future was somehow tied to the glowing screen before me. My dad spent perhaps more money than he thought justified for a computer that he didn't understand. It didn't help that within minutes of unwrapping, each machine presented a child with merely a blinking prompt. Parents didn’t want toys that generated endless questions.Some kids wanted their new box to play games, but others wanted to understand it and see what they could create. In the early days, many of the programs (games, budgeting, word processors, etc.) couldn't be ""downloaded"" or purchased in stores, but rather, were found printed in magazines to be manually typed in. What would be unacceptable tedium today set many of us on the path to programming. A person could write an entire game by himself, including graphics, sound, joystick input, etc. On a C64, the built-in ROM that handled BASIC was, itself, merely an 8K program (written by Bill Gates in his early 20s). Once you learned machine language, you could read the computer's memory to understand it, and then extend and change its behavior. The modest graphics, sound, and storage were a playground for boundless, creative novelty. The limitations turned to advantage, since anyone could produce passable sound and graphics for their games. Constraints can inspire greater ingenuity – consider how Bach's two part inventions transcended their dyadic restrictions through divine craftsmanship. It is a maximizing of the expression that can be found in the limited and the discretized, so much so that you forget the limitations. Though the computers were simple, in compensation, the software was all the more clever. Today, those who enjoy chess do so for the engaging possibilities contained in its few rules, not because the latest chess boards could be made to talk or blink.It was an odd feeling to have technical questions about this new toy that no school teacher or parent could answer. In the early days, most local libraries didn't carry relevant books. The world hadn't caught up with its children yet – an unprecedented phenomenon in human history. Much has changed. There is now, of course, no expectation that end users understand how to program. This is good of course, but the audience has dumbed down. The ingenious puzzles found in games of old have long ceased to be marketable to the increasingly average player. I remember the games -- the dark hallways and where they led, the secrets and how they were concealed. These are real places to me, preserved with the dream-like quality that comes with those memories untouched by an adult outlook. Children using computers today have an entirely different experience. While the creation of as-of-yet undiscovered computing experiences is unbounded, the barrier to entry is much higher. Modern games are not imagined into being by a single individual, but require a huge development/production staff of specialized skills, and tens of millions to get to market. The ever-increasing sophistication in user experience and the increasing distance from code prevents the kinds of exploratory play that bends a computer to the user's will. In its place are packaged, canned entertainments, designed to be linearly consumed. Through no fault of their own, children understand the 'What', but not the 'How', which means they have to wait on adults to create what is to be 'Next'. That’s where a book like this can roll back the clock, and bring back the magic that happened in the 80s. On the relatively new indy game scene, the tools (i.e. GameMaker) now exist where a single person can once again handle all of the sound, graphics, and programming. In some ways, it’s even better. Want to add background music? Just add it. No more building assembly language interrupt-based music players. Want to rotate a sprite? Just do it. No more drawing every possible rotation ahead of time. Want to port your games to your iphone or droid? Just do it. With the game making tools and languages that are available, you’re not stuck learning the specifics of each computer and OS type. Where I was learning that POKE 646,0 would turn my C64 cursor black, my son is learning about refactoring code using object hierarchies. That’s a huge improvement in abstraction, no matter what nostalgia whispers into my ear.The authors don’t really dwell on any of these “get off my lawn” rants, except for a paragraph near the very end of the book: They write, “Twenty years ago every self-respecting computer enthusiast owned a collection of books about programming games for the simple computers of the day. These books usually made the reader type in pages of code, which generally contained a generous helping of typing errors and bugs to work around. If you were lucky, then hours of painstaking labor might eventually be rewarded with the chance to control the letter O as it was chased around the screen by a couple of nasty-looking As. Nonetheless, it was books just like these that inspired us to write this one, because they were responsible for starting us down a path that lead to the game-related careers what we have today.”"

509,The Invention of Love,Tom Stoppard,4,1549,88,Kelly,4,"The second Stoppard play that I've read that obsesses on the nature of man's quest for knowledge, examines the motives of the industries (if you want to call them that) of people who are paid to do it, and tries to make the audience answer, really, what the benefit is of knowing obscure bits of knowledge that have little to no impact on how you balance your checkbook or design a house.I do think that Arcadia stated the issue more simply and beautifully and poignantly, from the brief elegance of, ""Its the wanting to know that makes us matter,"" to Septimus' glorious evocation of the continuous march of humankind, showing how nothing is ever really lost. But The Invention of Love has its own way of looking at the matter, woven into a story that has its own deep sadness and inevitable comedy, and it has a new obsession that couldn't be stated in a more lovely, Shakespearean-esque way. The Invention of Love centers on classical scholars and poets of the classical style, set in Oxford and a Greek religious afterlife, in the midst of Aesthetes and the practical, disinterseted immortals, amongst endlessly repeating memories and intervals of new discovery. It is absolutely obsessed with language. Characters endlessly correct each other on proper and likely readings and misinterpretations of various Latin and Greek phrases, and insist on getting the words right. ""The words, what were the words?"" This whole play is like Hamlet repeating ""Words, words, words,"" over and over again, sometimes as a song, sometimes as an intensely insane rant. Stoppard explores the idea, an idea that he dismissed in Arcadia, that the individual way that knowledge is discovered and expressed matters- not merely the idea and application of the idea itself. The personal stamp of the person who brings it to public knowledge matters. Who we acknowledge as the inventor matters. Arcadia made the case that as long as we are passionate in what we want and need to know, it does not matter much the way that we personally find to search for our truths, whether they be trivial, personal, or earth shaking, and that knowledge lost will be found again if humanity needs it, when it needs it. Invention of Love is a bit more indulgent of the idea that individual discoveries, and by extension, individual people at specific times matter. Its a bit more of a nostaglic love letter to scholars than Arcadia was- although it certainly pokes fun at the pompous and ridiculousness of most of them. That certainly isn't all this play is about, of course. It is also, as the title would suggest, about forms of love, especially those considered not quite ""right"" at the time, about friendship, the Aesthetic movement within the Victorian morality of the age. I responded to Stoppard's version of A.E. Housman and his unrequited love of an athlete named Moses Jackson. It is gently and not so gently heartbreaking to watch his feelings grow throughout the play and the ultimate culmination that Housman reaches at the end. Oh also, for those fans of Oscar Wilde, he's talked about for a good bit of the piece, but doesn't make a cameo appearance until the end, so you'll have to stick around after intermission to get a glimpse of him.Well worth it, as always."

I did skip several recipes that didn't appeal to me, but even on those recipes I skipped, I read the extra blurbs included that related to something specific in that recipe.Whether it be choosing the best springform pan or America's Test Kitchen's favorite chicken breast brand, there was always good information in every recipe.For those who are unaware, America's Test Kitchen prints several magazines every year (Cook's Illustrated, Cook's Country, etc.) and this annual cookbook is a collection of the best from that year. Each recipe gives a little backstory to how they tested dozens of different recipes to determine the best one. They have tips and tricks from producing an all-beef meatloaf (gelatin is the key substitute for veal) to making the perfect low fat cheesecake (making yogurt cheese overnight produces the thickness and tang lost by using less & light cream cheese)! I enjoy cooking, but add scientific explanations of how things work and I'm ecstatic.Already made one recipe (Hearty Slow-Cooker Beef Stew) which turned out good, but I think I may have made some mistakes (like draining the beefy oil when preparing the chunks the night before). But that's the great thing about these recipes—now it's my turn to try them again and again until I perfect them for myself! Dog-eared at least 20 recipes I want to try!"
6301,Smart Couples Finish Rich: 9 Steps to Creating a Rich Future for You and Your Partner,David Bach,3.83,1563,171,Jodi,5,"The Automatic Millionaire, by David Bach, was such an easy read and so motivational, I thought I'd see what he has to say in this book for couples. It gave really great information, but was almost identical to Smart Women Finish Rich, so you don't need to read both. I really had a hard time noticing much difference at all between the two. But this was a great source on how to easily save money regularly and invest for retirement, focusing on pre-tax contributions. A lot of the information is rather obvious, like paying yourself first, watching even the little purchases you make, and the power of compounding interest. But it also gave very helpful advice on chosing good insurance plans (health, life, disability, etc.) There was also a good chapter on how to increase your salary by 10% in 9 weeks. Overall, very good and basic information for people who might not understand much about investing."
7232,Only Necessary Thing,Henri J.M. Nouwen,4.32,450,28,Angela,4,"Every once in awhile you come across a book that hits you at just EXACTLY the right time on just EXACTLY the right topic at just EXACTLY the right depth. I tried to read this book a few years ago and just couldn't muddle through, but last week I picked it up with the thought, 'Either I read this book or I donate it - no sense continuing to store & dust it!' and it ended up being a divine appointment.Henri Nouwen is relatively unknown to me, but he smacks of an old-school style of writing that I find easy enough to read but incredibly challenging (in the best sense of the word) to digest. There is depth to his work that reflects a connection with God that I have never experienced.This particular book is a compilation of excerpts from something like 29 of his books - all small snippets on the practice if prayer. And perhaps that was my fatal flaw a few years ago when I attempted to read. I wasn't even at a level of prayer that could comprehend the things Henri alludes to. But my depth has grown immensely in this past year and the words that stumped me before are now whispers of invitation into the next level of prayer."

7233,Reaching Out,Henri J.M. Nouwen,4.28,2219,137,M Christopher,4,"The late Henri Nouwen's works are always worth reading. I was surprised, however, when this book seemed to start off slowly for me. As I got into it, I realized that the first two ""movements"" of the book's title promise, ""The Three Movements of the Spiritual Life,"" relate to things I've gone through some time ago (though I probably will again). The movement from loneliness to solitude is something that I've dealt with since I was a lonely / solitary child. The movement from hostility to hospitality has been a lifelong pursuit and one that I encourage now in others. But the movement from illusion to prayer got me right where I live.As with his other books that I've read, Nouwen's writing here is full of simple wisdom, helpful illustrations, and poignant memories. His relatively early death has been a loss to all those who seek the spiritual path."
2359,Dialogues in Swing: Intimate Conversations With the Stars of the Big Band Era,Fred Hall,4,2,1,Austin Gisriel,3,"This book didn't purport to be anything but a collection of interviews that author Fred Hall did with various big band era performers. And it wasn't. There was interesting information along the way, but there was never any connection between the interviews, no over-riding theme that held the book together.The interviews themselves seem to have been taken directly from the transcripts. Fred could have edited out the ""you know"" that we all place in our speech. It's an example of how this book has that ""thrown together"" feel."
2358,"The Other Side of Nowhere: Jazz, Improvisation, and Communities in Dialogue",Daniel Fischlin,4.33,6,1,Ralowe Ampu,5,"ooo this book is the hype, actually. was extremely pessimistic going in, as i get with most anthologies, but after a rather rough start it really gets going from george e. lewis on. ha the ""bird"" ""cage"" thing never even ever occurred to me. it was quite a thrill getting read about musicians i was into (wayne shorter, lindsay cooper, derek bailey, art blakey, elvin jones, evan parker) and ones i want to know more about like muhal richard abrams, and to know all the drama, even if the names pop up in passing, it was still hype. learned that judy garland did blackface, fuck you. learned about brando kicking it with miles or something. i'm not any type of person who thoroughly disbelieves the link between jazz and new music, if you're on of those people, perhaps someone i've set next to at a new music show, fuck you and here's your book. there's a chapter collecting misogynist bullshit women have encountered in the scene trying to be a musician. so this anthology was recommended to me for my research on ""outside"", and although it didn't really have anything, the essay by nate mackey is the title of the book that's been sitting on my shelf that i haven't even read yet that actually includes what i'm looking for; the piece in here by nate mackey is fucking awesome. although i gotta take this anthology back to the library it's definitely going to be on my shelf in someway because of all the crucial information inside!"
2353,Cold Counsel: Women in Old Norse Literature and Myth,Sarah M.  Anderson,3.73,15,2,Kate,3,"It's always difficult to review anthologies, moreso when they're a collection of difference authors, even moreso when the essays' formats aren't standardized. The latter was the greatest impediment for me--I don't know Icelandic, so I pretty much had to gloss over essays without a translation, which was especially frustrating when they were interesting: the opening essay, for instance, which went into the significance of the verb ""to mix"" and tied it to the eddic poem where Loki rages against the Aesir and is thrown out was really interesting, but since the author didn't translate the lines that she hung her argument on, I could only half-grasp it.Some of the essays seemed to conform more tightly to the central theme than others (the essay on the saga of Perceval, for instance, almost seemed only tangentially to discuss women's roles in the work), and one essay near the end needed better editing--there were several misspellings in it that were all the more glaring for the fact that it was a revision of a previous work (leading one to wonder whether the errors were introduced in the revision or if they were missed twice-over).Overall a very interesting work, with intriguing essays by the majority of the contributors."
8085,"Water (Tales of Elemental Spirits, #1)",Robin McKinley,3.63,2645,168,Miriam,3,"Six stories by married authors Peter Dickinson and Robin McKinley, to varying degrees themed around the element of water. Overall I liked McKinley's better (no surprise there), but Dickinson's ""Kraken"" was quite good too, making up for the dullness of his ""Sea Serpent"". The last three stories were better than the first three.The final story, ""Pool in the Desert,"" is set tangentially in the world of McKinley's Damar novels. It and Dickinson's first story, ""Mermaid Song,"" both felt as if they would have been better as longer novellas. They also had in common that the role of water was not particularly essential to the story."
8092,The Blue Sword,Robin McKinley,4.24,47201,2297,Tatiana,5,"This book proves once more that standards for YA fiction have gone significantly down over the last 10 years. You just rarely come by this kind of writing any more. ""The Blue Sword"" is an age old story of a young woman who after years feeling not belonging, invisible, and insignificant, finds her strength after being kidnapped by a mysterious Hill-king who possesses magic powers. Gradually she discovers an ancient magic inside herself, comes to terms with her abilities, acquires friends and love and a place where she truly belongs, as unexpected and unfamiliar as this place is to her.Yes, the story is familiar, but the sign of a real writing talent is to make it special and unforgettable. McKinley certainly succeeds in it. Her writing is flawless and sophisticated, the imagery of mysterious land of Damar is vivid - the horse-riding, the nomadic life style, the castle in the Hills - I get shivers just remembering the tangibility of the descriptions!, and the characters (even non-human characters - horses, hunting cats) are oh so well drawn. I mean a SWORD in this book actually has more personality than famed Bella Swan!I just don't understand why this book is not better known these days or known as a ""hidden gem""? A vocabulary is too sophisticated, or not enough making out in it? It makes me sad that books like this are so obscure and all kinds of trash sells millions of copies!If I have to point any flaws in the book, I'd say I wish the writing had a little more intensity to it, or I would have loved to see more passion in Harry, to see her unleash the power of her kelar onto a man she loves. But this is a crazy fantasy of mine, there is no real reason to spoil a perfectly good story. This is certainly not my last Robin McKinley book."
8089,Rose Daughter,Robin McKinley,3.77,16753,987,Tadiana ✩Night Owl☽,3,"This is Robin McKinley's second take on the Beauty and the Beast fairy tale. I'm a lifelong fan of McKinley, but this book was my first indication that her writing style might be headed in a direction that is, shall we say, less accessible to the average reader. I've read Rose Daughter twice, several years apart, but still have extremely mixed emotions about it. It's slow-paced, it introduces interesting ideas and then simply drops them, the magical part is and always has been confusing to me (for some reason that happens with a fair amount of frequency in Robin McKinley's later books), and reading THAT ENDING was seriously one of the most ""The hell??"" moments for me ever. (view spoiler)[ Beauty decides, because of reasons, not to have the Beast turn back into a man. I've just never been able to reconcile myself to Beauty being married to an actual beast. Wait, what? What will their kids look like? Could they even have kids? What will sleeping with him be like? o__O It's a nice thought (that you love someone for who they are) but totally failed the Squickiness Test® for me  (hide spoiler)].And yet. I enjoyed the characters and relationships between the three sisters (McKinley likes to have the sisters be worthwhile humans; none of that sister-hate here). There are some scenes with animals popping up in Beauty's rooms that are absolutely delightful. McKinley has always written fantastic animal scenes. And fairly frequently I read parts that struck me with their loveliness and reminded me of why I always read McKinley's books, even when I find major parts of them rather frustrating. McKinley's first take on this fable, Beauty, is a much simpler, straightforward retelling of the tale, and it lacks the elements that make me grit my teeth, always a plus. That one is still my favorite Beauty and the Beast retelling, and probably always will be. But if you don't mind a slower-paced, rather ambiguous fairy tale, you may very well enjoy Rose Daughter.I guess it says something about my mixed feelings for this book that I've given it a middling rating but I haven't been able to bring myself to get rid of my copy of this book, even though I'm not at all sure I'll ever read it again. On the other hand, it's a nice hardback book that I paid full retail price for, so maybe it's just me being stubborn here."
8088,Sunshine,Robin McKinley,3.85,31048,3637,Kat Kennedy,3,"Okay, so I seriously pondered over whether to give this book three stars or four. In the end, I DID enjoy it so I felt generous and gave it four, but it's not without its faults.Once, when I was a little kid, my parents bought me my favourite ice cream. There's actually only one kind of ice cream that I actually like and that's mint choc chip. Only they bought this MASSIVE bowl of it with a banana in it and extra chocolate sauce. I can only guess that they'd finally decided to slowly kill me via diabetes, cholesterol and blood-pressure, and be rid of my annoying, argumentative, five-year-old ways. I can promise that it almost worked and they were almost home free except they'd miscalculated one thing - my short attention span. Sure the ice cream was delicious and kept me entertained but there was just so much of it and the mint ice cream was just a little too much in ratio to the choc chip that I like and even the chocolate sauce couldn't entirely keep my concentration.Well, Sunshine is a bit like that. It's good. It's really good. It's a vampire novel so it's pretty much RIGHT up my alley too and so by definition I should have really enjoyed this book.There was really just the problem that there was too much useless narrative in ratio to the action and suspense. Sunshine would start babbling about some inane facet of life that had NOTHING to do with the story and doesn't really add anything to it. Now, if this was world building for a future novel I could have forgiven it, but I have heard, rather mournfully, that there will be no more to this series and that makes me very annoyed. Like when I lost interest in my mint choc chip ice cream at one interval and my evil parents had it whisked away by an annoyed waitress (I'll have my revenge one day!)So whilst I enjoyed much of the book, I found myself falling asleep a lot because it would launch into these long stories like my 80 year old grandma does when you ask her how her day was. Don't even get me started on how UNRESOLVED the end was. There were things I REALLY wanted to know. There were certain sexy scenes I REALLY wanted to read and there was information and intrigue that was left dangling! It's infuriating!One good praise I would like to make for Sunshine is the reversal in a genre of a practice that baffles me. I've complained before that often in YA books, swearing and sex between the main characters doesn't really happen.Yet rape and violence is often described and occurs, sometimes rather graphically.Well, in this book the main character has sex with her long time boyfriend and it's a sweet nonevent - these positive and healthy examples of sex are good! Can we have more caring and loving and healthy relationships displayed for our youth like this, please? There is one particular swearword I wished the book hadn't used (it starts with C and rhymes with bunt... figure it out.)I really hate that word. But the two mentions of dick are cool with me - except Robin Cockblocking McKinley is a cockblocking temptress of doom and if you have read this book then you'll know why I say this! Can someone explain to me why she is not continuing with Sunshine and Con? Please? Why? Why build all this world and have all this and cockblock us (Yes! That's exactly what you did!) only to leave us hanging? It's just rude. At this point I really wouldn't mind what would end out to be the literary equivalent of a pityfuck just to satisfy me and tie up all the freakin' loose ends!Finally, I say I enjoyed this book. I did. Like my ice cream, it was just the kind of thing I liked. Too bad there was so much of it and at times it became work just to get through it and finally finish it. Over all, it was a really good serving of mint choc chip ice cream with a huge serving of cockblock. I liked it, but I refuse to go on a date with Robin McKinley again unless she promises to put out."
8091,The Door in the Hedge,Robin McKinley,3.67,8160,457,Kathryn,3,"One of the problems with books today is that the literary establishment looks down on genre fiction. If your fiction is fantasy or science fiction or mystery or romance or something else readily classifiable, the thinking goes, it is not literary and therefore inferior. And, of course, modern authors are expected to include any amount of “intimacy” in their novels. So someone like Robin McKinley, who writes fantasy and typically doesn’t get graphic, gets classified as a young adult genre author, which is pretty much the kiss of death as far as “literary critics” are concerned – no matter how good her writing actually is. (She has won a Newbery, though, which counts for a lot.) It’s frustrating.Anyway, I’m quite fond of genre fiction myself, particularly fantasy and especially retellings of fairy tales, and Robin McKinley is one of my favorite authors. The Door in the Hedge is a collection of four short stories, two of which are retellings of old fairy tales (“The Twelve Dancing Princesses” and “The Princess and the Frog”) and two of which could readily be classified as fairy tales themselves* (“The Stolen Princess” and “The Hunting of the Hind”). McKinley is a master of the fairy tale; all four stories feature classic fairy tale imagery and themes. As someone who has unredacted Grimm** on her bookshelf and the whole rainbow of Andrew Lang on her Nook, I LOVE fairy tales and will never get tired of them. I definitely recommend Robin McKinley in general and The Door in the Hedge in particular to fellow fairy tale lovers.Postscript: A random observation that doesn’t fit anywhere else: The most notable element of these stories is the enhanced role of the female characters (even in “The Twelve Dancing Princesses”; it’s subtle, but it’s there). McKinley is well-known for her dislike of the wilting flower type common in older books (*cough*edgarriceburroughs*cough*), and typically writes strong female characters like Aerin and Harry (short for Angharad). Honestly, as a kid, I never noticed this emphasis – I just thought of Aerin as a hero, regardless of gender. Shouldn’t we all strive to be brave and honest and true, regardless of what dangly bits we do or do not have? And I think McKinley generally feels the same way; unlike Tamora Pierce, McKinley can present a female character without having to constantly remind you that LOOK! A GIRL IS DOING STUFF ONLY BOYS ARE SUPPOSED TO DO! LOOK HOW SUBVERSIVE I’M BEING! (Not that I don’t like Tamora Pierce, but I found the “grrl power” motif in the Lioness Quartet very annoying.)*The definition of the term “fairy tale” as a literary categorization of the broader genre of “traditional stories” isn’t entirely agreed-upon. Me, I know ‘em when I see ‘em.**If the wicked stepmother gets forced to dance in red-hot iron shoes until she falls down dead, it’s unredacted. If she’s given a stern warning and sent to her room to think about what she did, not so much."
8090,A Knot in the Grain and Other Stories,Robin McKinley,3.74,4268,159,Tadiana ✩Night Owl☽,4,"Full review, originally posted on www.FantasyLiterature.com:I’m not sure if I bought this fantasy short story collection by Robin McKinley when I first saw it in the mid-1990s because McKinley was one of my favorite fantasy authors or because I was entranced by the cover art on the paperback, with the colorful contrast between the girl in a brilliant sapphire dress and the bright gold background of buttercups. Actually, at that time I was pretty much automatically buying everything McKinley wrote. Regardless, I very much enjoyed the collection of five fantasy short stories, and have reread them several times since. These tales are set in different lands and, for the most part, different worlds, but they are bound together by the fantasy element and their young women protagonists. As a whole, I rate this collection 4 stars, but I’ve given each story its own rating below.“Healer” is set in same fantasy world as Damar, the desert land explored more deeply in The Blue Sword and The Hero and the Crown. Lily, a gifted healer apprentice, has been mute since birth, and feels some bitterness toward her inability to communicate. When she is twenty, she meets Sahath, a jaded wizard who has lost almost all of his powers, but retains the ability to mindspeak. Lily is entranced with him, the first person she has ever been able to truly communicate with, although her teacher and friend Jolin fears him:What, she asked herself in fear, might this man do to her, in her innocence, her pleasure in the opening of a door so long closed to her, and open now only to this stranger? Mages were not to be trusted on a human scale of right and wrong, reason and unreason. Mages were sworn to other things. Jolin understood that they were sworn to ― goodness, to rightness; but often that goodness was of a high, far sort that looked very much like misery to the smaller folk who had to live near it.When Sahath offers to take Lily to his old master, the great mage, to see if he can give Lily her voice, all three ― Jolin, Lily and Sahath ― must face their fears.The quiet pace of this story fits its subject matter; not just Lily’s physical silence, but also Sahath’s slowly learning to love and hope again. For readers who love the character of Luthe and the world of Damar, it’s also a pleasure to revisit them again, however briefly. 3.5 stars.*****In “The Stagman,” the princess Ruen has been raised in the shadow of her uncle, who became Regent over their kingdom when Ruen’s parents died. Her uncle is a man who has grasped power and does not wish to relinquish it to Ruen. So he isolates her, with no friends or family or even servants that she can rely on, and sees to it that she is given only instructions and lessons that are too difficult to comprehend. Ruen grows up passive, dazed and inadequate.On Ruen’s name day when she is supposed to be named queen, her uncle announces that magical portents warn against it. Instead Ruen is left chained to stones outside the city, to die as a human sacrifice to the half-man, half-beast monster that lately has been sighted in the kingdom. What happens thereafter that is not at all what either Ruen or her uncle had expected.“The Stagman,” like “Healer,” is set in the world of Damar: Luthe once again makes a brief but critical appearance in the tale. The titular stagman is a mysterious shapeshifter that Ruen meets at a couple of key points in her life. Ruen’s name is indicative of her bittersweet life; she’s a solemn character who floats along letting other make decisions for her, and her passivity and emotional isolation makes her difficult to empathize with. Ruen remains passive until the very end, when she suddenly makes an understandable but controversial choice. 2 stars.*****“Touk’s House” is a variant on the Rapunzel fairy tale: a woodcutter’s youngest daughter falls ill, and the local doctor suggests that an herb from a nearby witch’s garden might heal her. In desperation, the woodcutter steals the herb, is caught by the witch, and given the herb (a different one than the one he was trying to steal) that will heal his daughter. But in return he is forced to give the witch his wife’s unborn child, their fifth daughter. At this point the tale veers off in a somewhat different direction: the witch Maugie raises baby Erana with love and teaches her the healing arts, and Maugie’s son Touk, half-troll with green skin and fangs, falls in love with Erana as she grows older. But Erana has to follow her own path first to decide what she wants in life.This is another quiet tale, simply told, but with some unexpected insights into the various forms that love may take, and showing that winning a kingdom and the hand of a handsome prince might not be the optimal place to find personal happiness and peace. 3.5 stars.*****Perhaps appropriately because of my cover love for this book, my favorite story in this collection is “Buttercups.” Pos, an older widowed farmer, sees a chestnut-haired young woman at the market each week and falls in love. Awkwardly, he begins to court her, hardly believing that she can be interested in a man twenty years older than she. But Coral treats him with great affection, and agrees to be his wife when he eventually asks her. Transcendently blissful at first, Pos soon discovers two holes in the weave of his happiness: First, he overhears a servant’s spiteful gossip that Coral only married him to get away from her family’s poverty. The second is a troublesome hillock on his farm that stubbornly refuses to be cultivated and will grow only buttercups. When Pos and Coral discover that their horses’ shoes temporarily turn to gold when they ride their horses on Buttercup Hill, Pos begins to think that his second dilemma might be the answer to his first. He decides to try taking the horseshoes off the horse while they are gold, hoping that they’ll then remain gold, and thinking that Coral might be more content to stay if he is a richer man. But the wild magic of Buttercup Hill reacts in a way Pos never expected, and suddenly he has other major troubles to deal with.In “Buttercups,” magic touches ordinary lives in a fascinating way. The interplay between the magical events and the characters’ lives, and the understanding Pos gains not only about Coral, but about his own heart and the need for honest communication, make this a wonderful moral tale as well as an unusual fantasy. 5 stars.*****The final story, “A Knot in the Grain,” is set in our modern world, with just a touch of magic. High school junior Annabelle has moved with her family to a new town, and Annabelle is feeling rather lost and adrift as the new kid in town, missing her old friends, and wanting to make new friends but feeling too shy and awkward to do so. In her attic bedroom one day, she touches a knot in a wooden beam in the low ceiling, which opens a crack to reveal a narrow set of stairs leading to a tiny hidden room. And in the hidden are shelves, and books, and a mysterious wooden box. The box seems to exude some kind of power, and it somehow seems very anxious to help Annabelle with any problems and concerns in her life.“A Knot in the Grain” is the most overtly young adult story in this collection, with its teenage main character and her high school concerns, but I still found myself pulled into Annabelle’s world and interested in the outcome. It’s a fairly straightforward magical realism type of tale, but it takes an unexpected and thought-provoking turn in the end. 4 stars.*****These fantasies turn more on the internal lives of their characters than exciting adventures, but their quieter and thoughtful approach has its own appeal. McKinley’s recent works are sometimes frustrating in their lack of clarity and resolution, particularly with her penchant for including nightmarish and incomprehensible magical clashes. These stories from earlier in her career have a refreshing simplicity in comparison, evocative of classic folk and fairy tales."
8087,Deerskin,Robin McKinley,3.88,17853,1132,Lizzi Crystal,1,"This book strikes such a discord in me that I have to start reviewing before actually finishing it. Halfway through, the writing is beautiful, exquisite, but circles around and repeats itself so often I was on page 90 before anything had actually happened, which would be fine, except for the hazy treatment of rape and incest. It doesn't capture the seriousness or tragedy. ...And having finished it, I think the same. Boring is a mild word for it - I've never read anything that dragged, and dragged, and dragged for 300 pages and repeated the same sentiments so often. If I wasn't such a dog-lover I wouldn't have made it through. Her descriptions of those scenes were amazing, as were all the descriptions - the phrases flowed from the page like rivers, but weren't enough to save it, for me. I couldn't believe the main character at all. McKinley's view of trauma - rape, incest, miscarriage - is absolute crap and offensive to people who have actually been through those things. I couldn't believe she tried to romanticize such horrible things. She told the story very well, as she thought of it; unfortunately all the sentiments were contrived and false."
3843,Doré's Illustrations for Don Quixote,Gustave Doré,4.57,139,9,Kalliope,5,"With the name of Gustave Doré (1832-1883), the illustrations of Dante, of Ariosto and of Cervantes come first to mind. He also carried out others now less well known, such as Paradise Lost, the Bible and Rabelais. Doré had embarked at an early age, in his twenties, to illustrate the great books of Western culture.But while with other works we can also think of other major illustrators who vie with Doré for stamping on our minds the visual equivalent to text-- for we also have, in the case of Dante Botticelli’s, Blake’s and Dalí’s astounding series--with Cervantes Doré has imprinted the definite image. And even if he has somewhat falsified Quijote’s looks, since he continues to hat the chivalric hero with the barber’s basin in the Second part of the book, when Quijote no longer wore it, it does not really matter. For us now, thanks to Doré, Quijote always wore his back.This is an extraordinary selection of the total of 379 illustrations of the original collection. It includes the full 120 large, folio size, engravings, as well as 70 of the smaller ones.This edition comes with a very brief preface which mentions other illustrators. The main ones were the also French Antoine Coypel (1661-1722), and a couple of examples of his are enough to disconcert the modern reader, so fixed are we with Doré’s version. or, even in an engraved version, medium which we now also come to expect as more appropriate for the illustration of a text than an oil painting:Couple's version of Quijote's meeting with the windmills (episode to which I will return with Doré), cannot drop the inclination to use allegorical figures to express abstract concepts, so we see the flying female figure of Madness and the frivolous Cupid figuring Love as always. Coypel was using the visual language of his times; the one with which he could express himself and the one with which he would be understood. And to us, now, it seems ironic that Coypel resorts to fantasy when illustrating a novel that ridicules overwrought fantasy.Much harder to find in the web are examples of the German Daniel Chodowiecki (1726-1801), and I have found only one in the web and only of Sancho, when he is prevented from eating while he is Governor of his Ínsula, but which I have been unable to paste . I detect however a theatrical approach to his images.We also have the iconic version by Picasso, but sadly, he did not illustrate the text. Just created an image.Returning to Doré, and in particular to his large plates, I have been marvelled by several aspects: his framing and fragmentation of spaces; his use of light and dark; his use of texture (owes a great deal to Rembrandt); his command of the various sceneries (whether these are Oriental, Courtly, Rural, or Natural-Romantic). But the most striking aspect is his intelligence and this is best exemplified by my favourite scene, selected as the cover of the book by Dover, showing Quijote and Rocinante being lifted off by one of the wings of the gigantic windmill. The foreshortened Quijote together with a fraction of the mill’s arm give wings and make Rocinante fly and convert him back to a fantastic horse that not even Pegasus could equal.Having this on the side, while reading Cervantes, has been a lot of fun. The process I followed was to read first and then run to Doré’s illustrations excited with the anticipation of finding which scenes had he chosen to illustrate and see them in their visual splendour. I always embraced Doré’s proposal and I just feel sad that Cervantes himself had not seen them.Ah, if I could command a Time-Travel machine and sit Miguel de Cervantes to leaf through Doré's version of his masterpiece....."
3850,Heat Wave: A Social Autopsy of Disaster in Chicago,Eric Klinenberg,3.81,621,69,Lorianne DiSabato,4,"The story of the deadly 1995 Chicago heat wave is fascinating enough, but don't expect Eric Klinenberg's book to be a popularly-accessible page-turner. Klinenberg's book was written as a dissertation in sociology, so its methodology and supporting evidence are sound, but it seems to have been revised only minimally (if at all) for a lay audience.The upshot of Klinenberg's analysis of what led to so many deaths in Chicago in July, 1995 is that living alone leads to dying alone, as getting out of sweltering tenement apartments and single-occupancy rooms--the kind of accommodations peopled by the urban poor and elderly--is essential for survival in a heat wave. In order to get out of their rooms and apartments, however, both the poor and elderly need to have welcoming (and cool) places to go, they need to feel safe walking their neighborhood streets and sidewalks, and they need to feel connected with (or at least trusting of) their neighbors and surrounding communities. Klinenberg's book is illustrated with indelible images of the disaster, including photos of emergency workers removing victims in body bags from locked, air-tight apartments: visual proof that its not the heat nor the humidity that kills in a heat wave; it's the social isolation."
5074,Last Orders,Brian W. Aldiss,3.7,46,5,Keith Currie,3,"A very unusual compilation of short stories by the SF master: the theme is the cyclic nature of life, society and culture. Each story influences the others; characters with the same names or similar names appear and reappear but in each time zone with differences, sometimes subtle, sometimes radical. The nature of reality is questioned. The nature of time is questioned. The nature of experience is questioned. A story read late in the book sends the reader back to others already read. New connections, or divergent paths occur hours and days after reading. The stories themselves vary in quality - all provoke thought, but sometimes irritation too. One brilliant story made the collection worthwhile for me. 'An Appearance of Life' sees a Seeker from the far distant future visit the galactic museum on the planet Norma, where he discovers, recreates and experiences a long dead love affair from a past age. This story, while it fits the theme of the collection, also transcends it, with its moving and emotional content, quite different from the often cold and dismissive tone of other stories."

2116,Essays on Ayn Rand's the Fountainhead,Robert Mayhew,4.13,63,1,Caroline Buckey,5,"When I finish a book, I'm always eager to learn what other people thought of it, so I usually spend some time reading reviews of it online. I also usually get frustrated that most reviews spend a lot of time summarizing the book, which I'm not interested in. After reading The Fountainhead, I got frustrated as usual, and then happened to find this book and decided to try it. It scratched that itch a lot better than reading reviews online! I think I'm going to try looking for meta books more often.All the essays in this book seemed extremely well-researched and thoughtful. I especially liked the essays on the history of The Fountainhead because I learned a lot of objective facts from those. My favorite two described the major revisions Rand made to the Fountainhead, and the process of turning it into a movie. I liked seeing how different the final book was from both the initial draft and screenplays written by people other than Rand.My main complaint about this book is that not a single essay had anything negative to say about The Fountainhead, or even anything neutral or less than glowing. It would have been nice to get a more balanced set of perspectives.Another minor complaint is that it included discussion of Atlas Shrugged and a significant spoiler for We the Living. I've already read We the Living, and there weren't really spoilers per se for Atlas Shrugged, but I prefer to know almost nothing about a book before I start reading it, and now I know things like who the main character is and how its theme compares to The Fountainhead's."
2119,The Fountainhead of Chinese Erotica: The Lord of Perfect Satisfaction (Ruyijun zhuan) With a Translation and Critical Edition,Charles R. Stone,4,6,1,Patricia,4,"In terms of academic research, this book deserves 4 to 5 stars, but because it did not align with my own interests, and I think of most readers of this Goodreads site, a 2-star rating (""It was OK"") would have been more honest, so please go beyond the star rating and read this review carefully.This is the academic study of a little-known anonymous Chinese tale (Ruyujuan, ""The Lord of Perfect Satisfaction"") that appeared during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). It is a short work of fiction that purports to be the 'true story' of the infamous Tang Empress Wu Zetian who proclaimed herself Empress after banishing the crown prince, to live a life of sexual debauchery, incest, adultery, murder and corruption. The 'Lord of Perfect Satisfaction"" is her paramour, a, extremely well-endowed low-born individual, Xue Aocao. The book is blatantly pornographic but it is a unique pornography for it puzzles more than titillates; the text is an ill-covered sermon on debauchery and the abuse of power.Author Stone carefully dissects the tale, proposing the text's author (most convincingly using access to the information, writing style, and other evidence) to be the Confucian scholar Huang Xun (who was appointed a magistrate of Jiaxing district in 1530). He reveals the historical characters and incidents the story alludes to, solves a number of mysterious references in the text, discusses the role of pornography in China and the West, and then follows up with the original text and an annotated translation. In short, it is a well-presented, if heavy-going at times (and a little too repetitious here and there) academic analysis of a relatively unknown Ming short novel. But if you're looking to read a more honestly erotic Chinese novel, you'll get more satisfaction from reading Jin Ping Mei, The Carnal Prayer Mat, Hongloumen, or selections from popular Ming short stories. If you're interested in Chinese sexual life in ancient China, I would recommend the classic van Gulik text, Sexual Life in Ancient China : a Preliminary Survey of Chinese Sex and Society from Ca. 1500 B. C. Till 1644 A. D. / by R. H. Van Gulik ; with a New Introduction and Bibliography by Paul R. GoldinRecommended for scholars and researchers of Empress Wu Zetian, the Tang Dynasty, Ming novels, and Chinese eroticism. There is a short but useful Glossary, and an excellent bibliography of works on Chinese erotic literature and pornography."
3844,"Heat: An Amateur's Adventures as Kitchen Slave, Line Cook, Pasta-Maker, and Apprentice to a Butcher in Tuscany",Bill Buford,3.89,20169,1823,Valerie,3,"I started reading Heat without any prior knowledge of Mario Batali. I'd never cooked from any of his cookbooks, or seen his show. That said, the book was an interesting look at his life - an absolutely crazy one filled with gluttony, extreme restaurant hours and seemingly never-ending partying.But the focus of the book is not only Batali (although he steals the show, in my opinion). Actually written by Bill Buford about his time spent in one of Batali's restaurant kitchens (Babbo in NYC), Heat also tells the story of his progression from home chef (and former New Yorker writer) to that of a line-cook and ultimately a pasta maker at the restaurant. It also serves as a memoir of his own time spent in Italy learning to cook pasta and butcher, as well as a history of Italian food. I felt that the most interesting parts were those chronicling his time in the kitchen at Babbo and telling Batali's personal story. The parts that, in the end, were the least interesting to me were those detailing the regional gastronomy of Italy, or the history of pasta... even as a person interested in food and cooking, some of these histories just went into too much detail and were too lengthy to hold my interest (for example, a seemingly unending chapter on when and why cooks starting adding eggs to their pasta dough). I was starting to lose interest in finishing the book, but what I found to be the most engaging part of Buford's personal experience (working with one of the best butchers in Italy) drew me back in.Heat did inspire me to check out some Batali cookbooks from the library, because since I finished reading it I've been having some incredible cravings for pasta with Bolognese sauce. It's also another book in the same vein of those that emphasize knowing your food - where it comes from, its quality, and really how to cook and enjoy it - that seem to be all the rage these days. If you: A) are really into Mario Batali, or are: B) willing to hand-roll sheets of pasta until they're translucent, or are: C) considering buying a whole pig at the farmer's market and butchering it yourself in your apartment, this is likely the book for you."
8538,"Break In (Kit Fielding, #1)",Dick Francis,4,3816,142,Vinaya,5,"Yes, I love Dick Francis. What's not to like?!There are fast horses...and hot men!Umm... I don't think that was exactly the jockey I was looking for, but what the hell! Eye Candy!Anyway, the Kit Fielding novels are probably my favorite of all Francis' books. Kit Fielding is a champion jockey with minor telepathic talent and a great affinity for horses. When his twin sister approaches him for help regarding some false accusations in a tabloid about her husband's training stables, Kit becomes involved in a conspiracy that goes all the way up the newspaper echelons and into the depths of the Honours Office. Like most of Francis' heroes, Kit is calm and laid-back with an underlying will of steel. His easygoing facade hides a sharp mind and a great deal of dogged stubbornness. Break In has all the ingredients required for a successful Dick Francis outing — horse races, a Princess and her beautiful niece, evil men with knives, family drama and a hero who can be both a real man and a gentleman. Fun times!Francis, much like his heroes, has a slow, easy way of writing that pulls you into the story almost without your knowledge. He has a simple, straightforward style of writing that makes for some excellent light reading. Even if, like me, you've never been near a horse in your life, you'll fall in love with his heartfelt descriptions of a jockey's life, his bond with his horses and the horse-racing scene in England. Having been a champion jockey himself, Francis definitely follows the rule of 'write what you know' and he does it excellently. If you're looking for some beach reading that's not chick lit or YA, Dick Francis is the way to go!"
2117,Fountainhead (Cliffs Notes),Andrew Bernstein,3.64,36,3,Kelly,3,"I read this because I wanted to better understand an author who is distressingly influential on current U.S. politics... but I didn't want to waste the time or brain cells on the actual book. It took me weeks to read this little book because I'd throw it at the wall every few pages. I hate everything about it. The protagonist is the original Mary Sue special snowflake, and that's supposed to be what we all strive for. Barf. Giving the Cliffs Notes 3 stars because it seems to be a decent overview of a bad book, though perhaps overly fawning. I would have liked more criticism (in the literary sense) and less repetitive synopsis."
703,The Plot Against America,Philip Roth,3.71,29755,2551,Michael Finocchiaro,4,"Breathtaking and highly realistic, The Plot Against America is Philip Roth's vision of an alternative path history could have taken had Charles Lindbergh have not kept his anti-Semitism as a private matter, but (like Mr Trump) brought it into the political arena. In it, Roth features himself as the 6-8 year old narrator seeing the events from a Jewish kid's eyes in Newark. The scenario is Interesting, but what Roth does best is describe the terror and uncertainty of the days during this fictive version of 1940-1942 where the US President proudly wears a medal from Hitler (and in real life, Lindbergh did have one from Göring as Roth points out in the fascinating and exhaustive ""real history"" postscript) and introduces seemingly innocuous programs that are aimed at destroying the Jewish community. I will not give any spoilers because - even if it is too late before Election Day 2016 to read this - it is an excellent book and I would not want someone to read this review and pass it over. I did not give it five stars because as much as I liked it, it was not the narrative, gorgeous masterpiece that American Pastoral or The Human Stain were. Nonetheless, it is in the high end of the Roth oeuvre which I have discovered over the last few months to be endlessly full of surprises and variety - perhaps more so than most of the other writers I have read. Perhaps the Nobel committee would have gotten a callback had Roth been picked over Zimmerman this year?I cannot insist enough that this is a critical book to read NOW.The renaming of Inauguration Day by Drumpf is particularly chilling...and the promotion of Bannon to the National Security Council should scare the shit out of you.Here is a recent article from the New Yorker where Roth says that Trump is actually far worse than what he had imagined with Lindbergh. Resist, we must resist.The clock continues its inexorable ticking towards a devolution of American democracy. Putin is wringing his hands in delight much like Hitler does in Roth's book. However, it looks more like we are heading into a civil war with two sides that have opposing and irreconcilable views of reality. Let's hope we get a happy ending like that of Plot Against America rather than the dismal end of It Can't Happen Here. Time continues to slip by and the world continues to ressemble the hell in Roth's book."
8370,The Making Of Disney's Animal Kingdom Theme Park,Melody Malmberg,4.39,28,2,Andrew,4,"Nicely done. Malmberg charts the course of Animal Kingdom's creation from concept to opening day. As a former imagineers herself, she does an excellent job of giving attention to every facet of theme park design from ride creation to maintenance. She focuses on the actual people performing the jobs, and their unique backgrounds. More than anything else, a reader comes away with a better understanding of just what a monumental job it is to build a completely new theme park from scratch.I've had the opportunity to spend quite a bit of time at Walt Disney World over the years, and Animal Kingdom has become my favorite park to visit. The attention to detail and theming there really stands well above its three sister parks. In Walt and the Promise of Progress City, Sam Gennaway discussed the ""higher quality of life"" that Disney parks tend to exhibit. A certain ""quality without a name"" that makes a place feel inviting, comforting, or special. Animal Kingdom more than any other place in WDW is, to me, the embodiment of this quality. Walking through the park, one can't help but feel surrounded by the imagination and creativity of it's designers. Furthermore, Animal Kingdom has retained a commitment to education through entertainment, which is something EPCOT used to pride itself in, but has sadly been lost over time.All the above sentiments were feelings I already had before reading Malmberg's book. After reading, I can honestly say I have an even greater understanding and appreciation of the place. She treats her subject matter with a great deal of respect, but doesn't fall into the trap of elevating the Imagineers to the status of living gods (like many Disney books). She presents them as real people, with real problems to solve. The text is also supported with an enormous amount of beautiful photography. Hats off to Melody Malmberg, this is definitely a stand-out among books on Disney Imagineering."
52,El hacha,Gary Paulsen,3.68,236282,10616,Rachel,1,"So when I was in the 7th grade, Mrs. Randall (formerly Sr. Mary Randall, an ex-nun) FORCED this pile of garbage upon me and the rest of my unsuspecting classmates. I was an advanced reader and it was a relatively short, easy to swallow book but it took me FOREVER TO READ IT. because it was THAT FUCKING BORING. It's about this stupid snot of a kid whose parents are getting divorced (mom and dad broke up! boo-hoo :'( i'm scarred for life now!) and somehow his plane goes down in the wilderness of Canada (which I can admit is the scariest fucking thing I can possibly think of. I'd rather be faced with the zombie apocalypse or a gang of mass murdering rapists than being stuck in the middle of Canada) so snot-face has to learn to survive on his own. He has a hatchet that his mom gave him (though I really can't say what possessed her to give her poor no-one-wants-me warning signs of future school shootings son a HATCHET, but she does) and he eventually stops crying and figures out how to pick berries and chop trees. Or saplings. Or something. I don't know. All I know is, this is the worst book EVER. UGH. And Mrs. ""Ex-Nun"" Randall made us watch the MOVIE, too. it was TORTURE."
48,The Bucaneers,Edith Wharton,3.89,4746,326,Candi,5,"""First, the Romans had come. Then the Angles, Jutes, and Saxons. Then the Danes terrorized England for three centuries. Norman pirates took the country over in 1066. Five centuries later Turks raided the Thames and took prisoners to sell in the Libyan slave-market… But never had there been any phenomenon to match this… – this ‘invasion of England by American women and their chiefs of commissariat, the silent American men’…""This is by no means a high seas adventure story and you won’t find any swashbuckling pirates within these pages. What you will find is a delightful and wholly absorbing story about a group of ‘new rich’ young ladies and their struggle to attain social status and suitable husbands in the complex society of 1870’s New York. Annabel St. George, her sister Virginia, Lizzy and Mabel Elmsworth, and Conchita Closson will find that they just don’t quite fit into the highest of social circles. Rather than vacationing at the fashionable Newport, they find themselves strolling the verandahs of the apparently less exclusive Saratoga – much to the dismay of their overly ambitious and scheming mothers. Thank goodness for the likes of Miss Laura Testvalley who has been hired as governess to Annabel, or Nan. Miss Testvalley is a godsend indeed – more than just a teacher of letters, manners and music, she will help Nan navigate the tricky and unmerciful currents of her society. Nan is not your ordinary social ladder-climbing young woman. She is romantic and clever and has hopes and dreams beyond that of a marriage made simply with the goal of achieving rank and wealth. I do believe Miss Testvalley sees her own reflection in the young eyes of Nan. Miss Testvalley’s background and link to an impoverished family may not match that of Nan’s upbringing, but in those things that matter most in life – those of the mind and of the heart – Miss Testvalley is a true champion. I simply adored her steadfast affection and support of Nan and her well-being. Now, when one doesn’t quite succeed amongst the fierce competition of young ladies in New York society, there is one solution – England. At a time when many of the British aristocracy still upheld their titles and legacy but lacked the funds to sufficiently maintain their lands and other holdings, new money from overseas was perhaps just the ticket to preserving such heritage. And now behold ‘the buccaneers’ – our young ladies from New York. Can they – and their superficial mothers – achieve what they intensely desire in this country? There now exists a whole new set of rules and customs to which they must conform. Nan finds herself in love with the land and the sense of history which it invokes. Maybe finally this is a place in which she can find true happiness. ""It was not the atmosphere of London but of England which had gradually filled her veins and penetrated to her heart. She thought of the thinness of the mental and moral air in her own home: the noisy quarrels about nothing, the paltry preoccupations, her mother’s feverish interest in the fashions and follies of a society which had always ignored her. At least life in England had a background, layers and layers of rich deep background, of history, poetry, old traditional observances, beautiful houses, beautiful landscapes, beautiful ancient buildings, palaces, churches, cathedrals. Would it not be possible, in some mysterious way, to create for oneself a life out of all this richness, a life which would somehow make up for the poverty of one’s personal lot?""But what is a girl to do when presented with the attentions of Guy Thwarte – landholder and heir to Honourslove, a place towards which Nan feels herself somehow immediately attached, or the Duke of Tintagel – owner of the romantic and historical castle of Tintagel, a place steeped in the legends of King Arthur. How this plays out, you will have to find out for yourself! You will most likely root for Nan with as much devotion as did I and Miss Testvalley. You will nod in agreement with Edith Wharton’s subtle and witty scorn towards the customs and demands of both the New York upper crust as well as the British aristocracy. You will fall in love with the elegant prose which Wharton displays so flawlessly. One important note regarding this novel which did not in the least affect my desire to read it – Edith Wharton passed away prior to finishing writing this. My version included an ending completed by Marion Mainwaring, a Wharton scholar. I was not able to distinguish a difference in writing style between the words of Wharton versus Mainwaring, but then I am not by any means a Wharton scholar, but simply an amateur reader who thoroughly appreciated the effort put forth by Mainwaring. However, I can’t help but wish that Wharton had survived to see this novel through to completion. One will never know exactly how she intended for this to end, but I was nevertheless quite satisfied.

705,Democracy in America,Alexis de Tocqueville,3.99,17949,595,Roy Lotz,5," I struggle to penetrate God’s point of view, from which vantage point I try to observe and judge human affairs.A few months ago, bored at work and with no other obligations to tie me to New York, I decided that I would look into employment in Europe; and now, several months and an irksome visa process later, I am on the verge of setting off to Madrid. Unsurprisingly, I’m very excited to go; but of course leaving one’s home is always bittersweet. This is partly why I picked up Tocqueville’s Democracy in America, as a sort of literary good-bye kiss to this odd, uncouth, chaotic, and fantastic place which has, up until now, molded my character, sustained my body, and contained my thoughts.This turned out to be an excellent choice, for this book is without a doubt the best book ever written on the United States. I am able to say this, even though I haven’t even read a fraction of the books written on this country, because I simply can’t imagine how anyone could have done it better. As it is, I can hardly believe that Tocqueville could understand so much in the short span of his life; and when I recall that he wrote this book after only 9 months in America, while he was still in his thirties, I am doubly astounded. This seems scarcely human. Part of the reason for his seemingly miraculous ability is that, with Tocqueville, you find two things conjoined which are normally encountered separately: extremely keen powers of observation, and a forceful analytic mind. With most travel writers, you encounter only the former; and with most political philosophers, only the latter. The product of this combination is a nearly perfect marriage of facts and reasoning, of survey and criticism, the ideas always hovering just above the reality, transforming the apparently senseless fabric of society into a sensible and intelligible whole. Almost everything he sees, he understands; and not only does he understand what he sees, but so often hits upon the why. Although this book covers an enormous amount of ground—religion, slavery, culture, government, the role of women, just to name a few topics—there is one central question that runs through every subject: What does the appearance of democracy mean for the future of humanity? Tocqueville sees this question as the most pressing and significant one of his time; for, as he perceived, what was happening then in America was destined to inspire Europe and perhaps the whole world to adopt this new form of government, which would forever change the face of society. In short, Tocqueville is seeking to understand America so that he could understand the future; and the plan of the book follows these two goals successively. The first volume, published in 1835, is a thorough analysis of the United States; and the second volume, published in 1840, is a comparison of democracy and aristocracy, an attempt to pinpoint how a switch to a democratic government causes far-reaching changes in the whole culture.Tocqueville is famously ambivalent about American democracy. He often sounds greatly impressed at what he finds, noting how hardworking and self-reliant are most Americans; and yet so often, particularly in the second volume, Tocqueville sounds gloomy and pessimistic about what the future holds. Much of his analysis is centered on the idea of social equality. He often reminds the reader—and by the way, Tocqueville wrote this for a French audience—that Americans, rich or poor, famous or obscure, will treat everyone as an equal. The entire idea of castes or classes has, in Tocqueville’s opinion, been abolished; and this has had many effects. Most obviously, it gives free reign to American ambition, for anyone can potentially climb from the bottom to the top; thus results the ceaseless activity and endless financial scheming of Americans. And even those who are quite well-off are not spared from this fever of ambition, for the lack of inherited wealth and stable fortunes means that the rich must continually exert effort to maintain their fortunes. (Whether this is true anymore is another story.) Thus we find a kind of money-obsession, where everyone must constantly keep their minds in their wallets. In America, money is not only real currency, but cultural currency as well, a marker of success; and in this context, the creature comforts of life, which after all only money can buy, are elevated to great importance. Rich food, warm beds, spacious houses—these are praised above the simpler pleasures in life, such as agreeable conversation or pleasant walks on sunny days, as the former require money while the latter are free and available to anyone. The central irony of a classless society is that it forces everyone to focus constantly on their status, as it is always in jeopardy. You can imagine how shocking this must have been for Tocqueville, the son of an aristocratic family. There simply was no class of Americans who had the leisure of retiring from the cares of the world and contemplating the “higher” but less practical things in life. All thought was consumed in activity. This results in a society of the ordinary individual. In America, there are few “great men” (as Tocqueville would say) but a great many good ones. Americans are self-reliant, but not daring; they are often decent, but never saintly. They will sometimes risk their lives in pursuit of a fortune, but never their fortunes for the sake their lives. An American might temporarily accept hardship if there is a financial reward on the other end; but how many Americans would forsake their fortunes, their comforts, their houses and property, for the sake of an idea, a principle, a dream? Thus a kind of narrow ambition pervades the society, where everyone is hoping to better their lot, but almost nobody is hoping to do something beyond acquiring money and things. One can easily imagine the young Tocqueville, his mind filled with Machiavelli and Montesquieu, meeting American after American with no time or inclination for something as intangible as knowledge.In the midst of his large-scale cultural analysis, Tocqueville sometimes pauses for a time, putting off the role of philosopher to take up the role of prophet. Tocqueville does get many of his predictions wrong. For example, he did not at all foresee the Civil War—and in fact he thought Americans would never willingly risk their property fighting each other—and instead he thought that there would be a gigantic race war between blacks and whites in the south. But Tocqueville was otherwise quite right about race relations in the slave-owning states. He predicts that slavery could not possibly last, and that it would soon be abolished; and he notes that abolishing slavery will probably be the easiest task in improving the relationship between blacks and whites. For although slavery can be destroyed through legal action, the effects of slavery, the deep-rooted racial prejudice and hatred, cannot so easily be wiped clean. In support of this view, Tocqueville notes how badly treated are free blacks in the northern states, where slavery is banned. Without a place in society, they are shunned and fall into poverty. The persistence of the color line in America is a testament to Tocqueville’s genius and our failure to prove him wrong.But perhaps the most arresting prediction Tocqueville makes is about the future rivalry of the United States with Russia. Here are his words:Americans struggle against obstacles placed there by nature; Russians are in conflict with men. The former fight the wilderness and barbarity; the latter, civilization with all its weaponry: thus, American victories are achieved with the plowshare, Russia’s with the soldier’s sword.To achieve their aim, the former rely upon self-interest and allow free scope to the unguided strength and common sense of individuals.The latter focus the whole power of society upon a single man.The former deploy freedom as their main mode of action; the latter, slavish obedience.The point of departure is different, their paths are diverse but each of them seems destined by some secret providential design to hold in their hands the fate of half the world at some date in the future.While discussing such an obviously brilliant man as was Tocqueville, whose ideas have become foundational in the study of American society, it seems almost petty to praise his prose style. But I would be doing an injustice to any readers of this review if I failed to mention that Tocqueville is an extraordinary writer. I was consistently captivated by his ability to sum up his thoughts into crisp aphorisms and to compress his analyses into perfectly composed paragraphs. I can only imagine how much better it is in the original French. Here is only a brief example:Commerce is a natural opponent of all violent passions. It likes moderation, delights in compromise, carefully avoid angry outbursts. It is patient, flexible, subtle, and has recourse to extreme measures only when absolute necessity obliges it to do so. Commerce makes men independent of each other, gives them quite another idea of their personal value, persuades them to manage their own affairs, and teaches them to be successful. Hence it inclines them to liberty but draws them away from revolutions.In the brief space of a book review—even a long one—I cannot hope to do justice to such a wide-ranging, carefully argued, and incisive book as this. So I hope that I have managed to persuade you to at least add this work to your to-read list, long as it may be already. For my part, I can’t imagine a better book to have read as I prepare myself to visit a new continent, about the same age as was Tocqueville when he visited these shores, for my own travels in a strange place. And although, lowly American that I am, I cannot hope to achieve even a fraction of what Tocqueville has, perhaps his voice echoing in my ears will be enough to encourage me to look, to listen, and to understand."

2045,Chandler: Later Novels and Other Writings,Raymond Chandler,4.47,996,46,Jessica,4,"The summer I graduated from college my boyfriend and I had an abrupt, ugly breakup, and I moved out of the apartment we'd shared and into a studio on the other side of town. It was the first and only time I ever lived by myself. The apartment was in a large, smelly building downtown, and had a Murphy bed, a clawfoot bathtub, and an antique apparatus to speak with any visitors who buzzed in from downstairs. I don't know if the phone thing worked, as I had very few people stop by while I lived there. All my friends were in Southeast, and I kept my car across the river because there was nowhere to park near my place. All I remember eating the whole time I lived in that apartment was pasta salad, and I did almost nothing that summer but drink whiskey and read crime novels. It felt nearly impossible to do anything else. I got drunk by myself and read the classics -- Chandler, Hammett -- and an unholy amount of Elmore Leonard. I couldn't read any other kind of book at all.That summer's crime spree was my only real foray into that genre, and though I enjoyed it a lot, I haven't felt much need to go back to them since. What I remember thinking then is that most of the crime books I read seemed to be thinly disguised romances, written for men. This is definitely true of Elmore Leonard. The books of his I read were essentially hardboiled emotional bodice-rippers, with exceptionally well-crafted dialogue. The other thing I remembered about the crime novels was their obsession with the question of masculinity. The detective is always a tragic hero, who epitomizes the ideals of what a man should be, while struggling with its more painful implications (you know, loneliness and violence, stuff like that).What I remembered about Chandler was only the style, and that was still there when I went back this time. What I hadn't remembered, maybe because it's more present in the later novels, is his obsession with loneliness, and with ethics, and the question of how to be a truly moral man in a deeply corrupt world. Chandler talks about the traditional mystery novel as being a puzzle to solve; his own puzzle seems to be this riddle of ethics, and how to live correctly amidst depravity. Marlowe's the sinner you scratch to get the saint, the cynic who's obviously a wounded romantic. It's a type and a cliche, but he helped create it, and the whole thing's great to watch and a lot of fun. I read the novels in here in reverse order: his last book Playback(1958), followed by The Long Goodbye (1953) (his best, I think), then The Little Sister (1949) (fun) and finally The Lady in the Lake (1943), this last being the only one I'm sure that I'd read before. Then I did the essays, his letters (also fun), and the depressing chronology of his interesting life, which was nice because it did provide some context for the fiction, and confirmed a lot of the thoughts I'd been having about his approach to writing.Chandler only seems to care about a couple of things, and he cares about them a lot. One of those is style. In his letters he basically comes out and says that he really doesn't give a shit about plot, which should already be fairly obvious to anyone who's read him. Chandler has a very rigid and developed theory of the crime novel, and concern with plot is not a big priority. There's this part in one of his letters where he complains about contemporary fiction and sort of summarizes what he thinks is essential in writing:Can I do a piece for you entitled The Insignificance of Significance, in which I demonstrate in my usual whorehouse style that it doesn't matter a damn what a novel is about, that the only fiction of any moment in any age is that which does magic with words, and that the subject matter is only a springboard for the writer's imagination.... (p. 1028).And later, to somebody else:A good story cannot be devised; it has to be distilled. In the long run, however little you talk or even think about it, the most durable thing in writing is style, and style is the most valuable investment a writer can makes with his time. It pays off slowly, your agent will sneer at it, your publisher will misunderstand it, and it will take people you never even heard of to convince them by slow degrees that the writer who pus his individual mark on the way he writes will always pay off. He can't do it by trying, because the kind of style I am thinking about is a projection of personality and you have to have a personality before you can project it  (p. 1030).For instance:I stared. She caught me staring. She lifted her glance half an inch and I wasn't there anymore. But wherever I was I was holding my breath.There are blondes and blondes and it is almost a joke word nowadays. All blondes have their points, except perhaps the metallic ones who are as blond as a Zulu under the bleach and as to disposition as soft as a sidewalk. There is the small cute blonde who cheeps and twitters, and the big statuesque blonde who straight-arms you with an ice-cold glare. There is the blonde who gives you the up-from-under look and smells lovely and shimmers and hangs on your arm and is always very very tired when you take her home. She makes that helpless gesture and has that goddamned headache and you would like to slug her except that you are glad you found out about the headache before you invested too much time and money and hope in her. Because the headache will always be there, a weapon that never wears out and is deadly as the bravo's rapier or Lucrezia's poison vial.There is the soft and willing and alcoholic blonde who doesn't care what she wears as long as it is mink or where she goes as long as it is the Starlight Roof and there is plenty of dry champagne. There is the small perky blonde who is a little pale and wants to pay her own way and is full of sunshine and common sense and knows judo from the ground up and can toss a truck driver over her shoulder without missing more than one sentence out of the editorial in the Saturday Review. There is the pale, pale blonde with anemia of some non-fatal but incurable type. She is very languid and very shadowy and she speaks softly out of nowhere and you can't lay a finger on her because in the first place you don't want to and in the second place she is reading The Waste Land or Dante in the original, or Kafka or Kierkegaard or studying Provençal. She adores music and when the New York Philharmonic is playing Hindesmith she can tell you which one of the six bass viols came in a quarter of a beat too late. I hear Toscanini can also. That makes two of them.And lastly there is the gorgeous showpiece who will outlast three kingpin racketeers and then marry a couple of millionaires at a million a head and end up with a pale rose villa at Cap Antibes, an Alfa-Romeo town car complete with pilot and co-pilot, and a stable of shopworn aristocrats, all of whom she will treat with the affectionate absent-mindedness of an elderly duke saying goodnight to his butler.The dream across the way was none of these, not even of that kind of world. She was unclassifiable, as remote and clear as mountain water, as elusive as its color. I was still staring when a voice close to my elbow said:""I'm shockingly late. I apologize. You must blame it on this. My name's Howard Spencer. You're Marlowe, of course."" (from The Long Goodbye, pp. 490-491)If you have no use for this, you have no use for Chandler. I myself do (far more use than I have, say, for blondes).I find pretty frequently that when I return to characters who seemed purely cool and glamorous to me when I was younger, through adult eyes I see that they're tragic and flawed. Women love Marlowe (with alarming frequency), but he's really alone, consciously lonely, and desperately so. Marlowe's only real intimacy is with his reader, and the staggering sense of alienation and impossible yearning to connect with others was much more intense here than I'd remembered. Since (for reasons I simply could not guess at myself) loneliness is becoming one of my personal favorite literary tropes, I did enjoy that. Marlowe is sort of the stylish model for how to be alone amidst all the urban anomie and whatnot of the modern age. How sorry I am to have missed that era. If Marlowe'd had Internet, he would've been screwed.I obviously also enjoyed all the pulpy nuts crime stuff in its nostalgic glory! This is a mid-twentieth-century-LA landscape peopled with sensual blondes, mysterious brunettes, and sinister, syringe-wielding doctors. The police brutality comes hot and heavy, here as do hip references to the dangerous narcotic marihuana, which is clearly on par with a drug like heroin, and not with the alcohol being consumed in these pages at a liver-stiffening rate. Even just as a study in changing cultural mores, these novels are fascinating. There are shows on TV now about sympathetic drug dealers, but if you put this much smoking into a show today, it'd be banned.... If the Reefer Madness-style drug references seem a bit naive and dated, and if the sexpot names Eileen, Mildred, and Mavis have not aged well, and if the non-white characters would make your average 2009 reader screech in agonies of offense.... well, the cinematic descriptions of characters and sets are as flawless and beautiful as anything like this that has ever been written. I don't feel the need to get into how the master of this genre was the master of this genre, but clearly Chandler was quite the master of this genre, plus quite a bit more, and I'd be glad to slug it out in an alley in Bay City with any two-bit thug that'd argue otherwise.Chandler himself seems to have been a pretty interesting, tragic guy, sort of the classic damaged romantic-cynic with passionate ideals and a horrific drinking problem. He'd had a classical education in England, and comes off in his non-fiction writings as something of a tortured and self-aware snob who can't miss the irony that snobbery's the reason his own genre fiction is not taken seriously. I'd actually be interested in reading a biography of Chandler at some point, and I also want to revisit his earlier novels. These books are addictive as hell, and an immersive pleasure. I myself have gotten a lot more hardboiled just from reading Chandler, and I'd recommend him to anyone who'd like to do the same, provided you're not currently trying to quit smoking."

It has been conclusively demonstrated that literature is far older than the Kindle; books already existed thousands of years ago, which were the direct ancestors of today's e-publications. For example, careful examination reveals that The Odyssey and The Gospel according to Saint Mark are primitive versions of Percy Jackson and the Sea of Monsters and Bared to You. Similar relationships have been shown to obtain for all modern books.Problems arise, however, from the fact that these archaic protobooks still exist today; indeed, some have adapted to the e-reader environment and begun to thrive there. It is entirely too easy for an unsuspecting internet shopper to purchase a copy of Pride and Prejudice, incorrectly believing that it is part of the Twilight series. From the standpoint of formal literary theory, it is admittedly incorrect to say that Pride and Prejudice is ""worse"" than Twilight. They are simply different; neither one is ""worse"" than the other, since they have developed in different environments. From a practical point of view, however, a person who buys a Jane Austen novel is almost certain to be disappointed. There are no vampires or werewolves; sex is barely even hinted at; most upsettingly of all, the book will be full of long sentences and difficult words. The combination of these factors can only lead to an intensely unpleasant reading experience, which may discourage the reader from making new Amazon purchases for days or even weeks afterwards. Particularly given the fragile state of the US economy, this is evidently not an acceptable state of affairs.People have always exchanged recommendations and warnings with their friends, but it became clear that a more systematic approach was needed. There had to be a place where book-consumers could post advice and help each other avoid these infuriating mistakes, so that everyone could be sure of reading nothing but up-to-the-minute YA erotic paranormal romances.

2055,Long Goodbye,William H. Colby,4.19,57,10,Deb,4,"This was a hard book to read, because of the subject matter (the death of Nancy Cruzan, who was injured in an automobile accident and was brain dead, yet her family was unable to discontinue life support without a protracted legal battle). It was, however, very well written. The Cruzan case was a landmark in medical ethics, and the heartbreak her family went through was mind-numbing and ultimately destroyed her father.It's not a book I would normally have picked, but I participate in a palliative care book club, and it was one of the choices. Although I already have a living will, it reinforced how important it is to document one's preferences for care at the end of life. If you read this, and don't have such instructions for your family, please take the time to make your choices and set them in writing."
2047,Collected Stories,Raymond Chandler,4.38,463,44,Martin,5,"It is said that Chandler himself said that he cannibalised his short stories to write [some of] his novels. With this in mind, and having just recently read all seven of his [completed] novels back-to-back, I thought it'd be interesting to see just what exactly was borrowed/lifted from the short stories, and to what extent.Out of the 25 stories included here, and except for a few character name changes and minor plot thread adjustments to connect the different stories (re-)used, 2 (or 3) stories were, um... blatantly recycled for each of the following Chandler novels: The Big Sleep, Farewell, My Lovely, and The Lady in the Lake. Even the title for this last one was recycled!! The Lady in the Lake is probably my favourite Chandler novel (closely followed by Farewell, My Lovely), so re-reading them - or parts of them - I didn't mind so much at all. But what about the other stories? Well, there's some really good stuff in here, and some things you definitely would not expect from Raymond Chandler. For instance, one story (The Bronze Door) involves a huge magical (bronze) door, and anyone (or anything) that crosses its treshold just... disappears. With its plot and humour, this is the kind of story I'd expect to find in a Mark Twain anthology (for example: The Complete Short Stories of Mark Twain - yet another Everyman's Library book), certainly, but we can agree that Chandler and Twain are not exactly in the same market, and that's what makes it a welcome surprise.If you've read the three Chandler novels mentioned above, there's still plenty in here for you. This massive, 1299-page beast is anything but. The stories are so good, the pages practically turn themselves (it seems I could not avoid the oft-recycled cliché). It's a beautiful hardcover from the Everyman's Library series published by Alfred A. Knopf, and at the low price you can get it online from, say, Amazon - well, it's practically a crime NOT to get this book."
2059,The Long Goodbye. Based on the Novel by Raymond Chandler,Raymond Chandler,4.22,25329,1545,s.penkevich,5,"To say goodbye is to die a little.There are some books that just feel good to have on your dashboard, never too far from your fingertips to read in the tiny gaps between obligations and responsibility. The type of book that rides shotgun and keeps you company through the darker hours, through lonely nights at a shady laundromat or booze-soaked rainstorms on your porch. Raymond Chandler’s The Long Goodbye is that sort of book, that sort of friend. The past few months have seen some bleak times and I’ve been on a Chandler kick to press through them. Of all the Marlowe adventures, this was the one that stands out like a lighthouse in a storm telling an unforgettable tale of murder and mystery. Chandler took noir to soaring heights of literary acceptance with his works, joining Dashiell Hammett as an essential author of the genre and The Long Goodbye leaves an eternal mark on the face of literature even more so that the more upbeat and hardboiled The Big Sleep that kicked off the Phillip Marlowe novel series and inspired fantastic films such as The Big Lebowski. Goodbye is a novel for hard times, hard drinking, hard living; an aged and more cynical than ever Marlowe proves he’s worth his salt in honoring the memory of a short-lived but impactful friendship with Terry Lennox. Lennox, a war-hero alcoholic, has been a victim of either suicide or arranged murder in a small Mexican town while on the lam escaping an accusation for murder of his rich wife, and Marlowe will stop at nothing to see through the doors slammed shut by political power and fear and discover the truth. While a bit bloated, this is a novel of near perfection in the mystery genre that is guaranteed to keep you up at night, gladly dropping more quarters for another dryer cycle in order to keep reading because a mystery with Marlowe is about as good as life gets.To label this novel perfection would be to bastardize any opinions on the literature more widely accepted by the academy that I’ve previously championed and praised, but few novels have felt like a better friend in hard times than The Long Goodbye. Or perhaps it’s just that I like occupying Marlowe’s headspace. I even named my new cat after him upon completion of The Big Sleep. Marlowe is the type of man you wish you were, but not one you’d want to spend time with. He is fearless and devoted nearly to a fault, unafraid to play the asshole to get what he wants. He swims upon his moods and cherishes those moments of getting right up in someones face just to drown out a bad feeling or ascertain the truth. He calls everyone out on their bullshit and possesses a moral compass so strong that nobody besides himself seems to be worth a damn. Pushy and thorny, Marlowe is the hero for me. Reading a Chandler novel is much like geeking out on the old John Wayne films I’d watch with my father as a child, particularly True Grit. There are the pitfalls of blatant misogyny, racism (particularly towards Latin Americans in this one, which with my love of Latin American literature was particularly not cool) and cornball dated humor, but it is honestly very easy to overlook when the plot is that engaging, the writing that ‘cool’ and the novel so entertaining. How can you not love a novel with a passage like this:Alcohol is like love...The first kiss is magic, the second is intimate, the third is routine. After that you take the girl’s clothes off.¹This is the sort of novel that keeps you pouring a glass along with Marlowe—perhaps is that what they mean by an ‘active reader’, one who empathizes with the character and drinks when he drinks?—and despite being a pot-boiler of a thriller, never insults the intellect. The twists are fresh and the writing crisp. Granted, the novel is a bit bloated and some elements may raise the ‘really?’ eyebrow of critique, but on the whole it works. It is easy to consider many bits as cliche in the modern day, but important to remember that it was Chandler that invented it before it became cliche. There is also a really charming self-consciousness to this novel with regards to the writing. ‘Why did I go into such detail?’ Marlowe asks of himself, ‘because the charged atmosphere made every little thing stand out as a performance.’ The writing truly fits the scene and the P.I. narrator. While in most novels it would be easy to sneer at a lengthy passage on the physical description and dress of a character as they first walk on the scene, here it is at home since Marlowe would need to analyze a fresh face for all they are worth to build a profile of them quickly in order to interact with them and press for the goal. Chandler has a true gift for dialogue and character mannerisms as well, creating a wide, engaging cast. ‘He was a guy who talked with commas, like a heavy novel,’ he says at one point, and the dialogue of each character is always brilliantly nuanced. There is even a wonderful sense of satire on authors present, with Chandler poking fun at top-selling authors who write for profit and not for artistic merit, as is shown with Roger Wade. The continuous satire and critique of Hollywood and California that permeates Chandler’s novels comes alive in comical form with the desert sobering-up-clinic and the mentally challenged guard who cannot separate his fantasy role-playing of cowboys and tough guys from reality. On the surface it is easy to scoff at these scenes, but Chandler plays for something deeper.It is fascinating to have read Chandler grow as a writer and to see his characters develop and age over time. Like a racoon, Marlowe has grown older and meaner and tougher, but all the more honorable, strong-willed and fearless. Maybe I was tired and irritable. Maybe I felt a little guilty. I could learn to hate this guy without even knowing him. I could just look at him across the width of a cafeteria and want to kick his teeth inThe relationship between him and Ohl has soured a bit, both of them really elbowing the other in the ribs with more force and sadistic pleasure, with Ohl no longer a chain-smoker but constantly rubbing an unlit cigarette between his lips. What has not changed is the insight into Los Angeles and Hollywood, blossoming now into subtle jabs of social insight with Marlowe looking down at all the socialites as their sins and flaws seem to define them. The Long Goodbye reads almost like a western where the territory is wild and untamed and crime running rampant not as a driving force but as a symptom of the American lifestyle we have let cultivate itself. Power and greed and evil are seen here as byproducts of a society ruled by its own fear and vice, and Marlowe must navigate these deadly waters to uphold the good names of himself and those he cares about.The Long Goodbye is a cornerstone of noir and mystery that rises above any genre into simply being a beautiful piece of literature. A searing social critique orchestrated with dazzling plot twists, enviable dialogue prowess and a firm grounding in doing what is right simply because it is right, Chandler has created a masterpiece that is just as potent today as it was when first written. This is the sort of novel that scratches an itch of being both a fluff read and an intellectual endeavour (there must be a term for this somewhere) and grabs the reader by the throat and heart and won’t let go until the final, heart wrenching few lines. Plus, the Robert Altman film starring Elliott Gould is fantastic (though not a perfect adaption it still works) and rivals even Chinatown as a masterpiece of noir cinema. This novel was a true comfort on many a dark night and it was sad to see it end. Marlowe is a true literary hero and one I won’t ever forget.4.5/5‘Out there in the night of a thousand crimes people were dying, being maimed, cut by flying glass, crushed against steering wheels or under heavy tires. People were being beaten, robbed, strangled, raped, and murdered. People were hungry, sick; bored, desperate with loneliness or remorse or fear, angry, cruel, feverish, shaken by sobs. A city no worse than others, a city rich and vigorous and full of pride, a city lost and beaten and full of emptiness.It all depends on where you sit and what your own private score is. I didn’t have one. I didn’t care.I finished the drink and went to bed.’¹ While there is plenty of drinking to be had (finish this novel without wanting to go order a gimlet, I dare you), Chandler does well to also add an air of caution to the intake of alcohol. To drink in moderation is one thing, but the horrors of alcoholism and excess make up a major portion of the novel. ‘A man who drinks too much on occasion is still the same man as he was sober. An alcoholic, a real alcoholic, is not the same man at all. You can't predict anything about him for sure except that he will be someone you never met before.’"
4063,Love the Life You Live: 3 Secrets to Feeling Good--Deep Down in Your Soul,Les Parrott III,3.81,37,7,Jerry Raviol,3,"This is excellent practical advice with just the right mix of an easy read and thoughtful analysis. The manner and depth of presentation reflects the best the authors have to offer from their combined talents as both highly trained professionals engaged in individual counseling, and mass consumption authors. One of the authors is the founder of eHarmony.com – you must have seen the incessant ads on T.V.The book starts with the deep and simple plan that you need to have “profound significance, unswerving authenticity, and self-giving love to achieve happiness. One thing I really liked were the “tests” it offers to see how well you rate on different dimensions that can have an impact on your happiness. You answer a series of multiple choice questions and then look at the answer key to see how you rate. These are good tools for judging the areas you are doing well in, or the areas that need improvement, in the safety and comfort of your home. If you are brave enough the text also offers several exercises you can engage in with others to see the difference between how you perceive yourself, and how others perceive you. Remember we can never see our own dark spots. . It does not offer any one “Secret” that can change your life, but it does offer good discussions of key areas you can focus on to improve things. I liked how it talked about moving past your past, tuning into your self-talk, discovering you blind spots, and harnessing your wild side/passions. I enjoyed the discussion of the need to not simply destroying or choose not to act on our passions. We need to harness them, recognize they can be used for both good and bad, and learn to direct them towards the good that can bring us happiness."
4061,Finding the Love of Your Life,Neil Clark Warren,3.8,275,39,Abby,5,"This is one of the best books ever, period. Not so useful if you are already married, though. If you don't like your spouse, it will point out all the reasons you were dumb and shouldn't have married him or her. If you like your spouse, you'll congratulate yourself on being so level headed and smart, even in the passionate throes of young love.However, if you are still single BUY THIS BOOK BUY THIS BOOK BUY THIS BOOK!! It's not too late for you!!! Brent Barlow, a professor at BYU, assigned me to read this book when I was a single gal. Best assignment ever. I decided to marry my husband after reading this book. I would probably still be a lonely virgin today if it wasn't for this book."
4114,GOOD TO GRT  SOCIAL SECTOR PB,James C. Collins,4.04,4081,210,Ensiform,3,"A monograph to accompany Collins’ Good To Great (which I haven’t read). The underlying principle of this “missing chapter” is that we don't need to impose the language of business on the social sector, but develop a language of greatness. He does this by focusing on five issues that he used in the book and tweaking them for a different mission and context.The first is Defining Great (How do we calibrate success without business metrics?). Instead of money being an output, as it is in the business world, a quantifiable measure of success, in the social sectors money is only an input. Greatness here is measured by results (performance, impact, legacy) and is always an ongoing process. The next point is Level 5 Leadership (Getting things done within a diffuse power structure). Collins makes the point that without a clear hierarchy, or in the face of tenure in the case of colleges, true leadership is even more apparent in the social sectors. In business, CEOs can simply wield power. Here, leaders must inspire by their ambition for the cause. The third issue is “First Who” (Getting the right people on – and off – the bus within social sector constraints). Since the business model of firing and cross-promoting is not always as easy in the social sectors, especially those which rely heavily on volunteers, Collins suggest that leaders must simply create a pocket of greatness. Make this pocket selective, ambitious and meaningful, and the right people will come – and eventually, the mediocre ones will realize they’re in the wrong place. The fourth point is his Hedgehog Concept (Rethinking the economic engine without a profit motive). Here, Collins maintains the key concepts of “what you are passionate about” and “what you are best in the world at,” but replaces “what drives your economic engine” with “what drives your resource engine” – that is, how you best use the resources of time, money and brand. The last concept is Turning the Flywheel (Building momentum by building the brand, as each move you make builds on previous work and builds the foundation for future increases). As with Max DePree, I was impressed by Collins’ clarity of writing and the good solid sense he makes. Certainly, this is information that both educates and inspires."

I recommend this book to anyone who is new to eBay, wants to begin working from home, or wants to take their sales to the next level."
2367,Brave Companions,David McCullough,3.97,3017,391,Rex Fuller,4,"Haven’t read much by McCullough. Seems just a hair pretentious, like all liberal historians (I majored in history). But never mind all that. This is really good. It’s like having coffee with maybe the most fascinating collection of people you could pick. Just look who is here:Alexander von Humboldt, geographer, naturalist, surveyor, and much more, an “academy unto himself.” When visiting Jefferson in the White House to describe his, the first, explorations of South America, Humboldt flummoxed his listeners – but not Jefferson himself – by slipping unknowingly from English to German to French and Spanish.Harriet Beecher Stowe, who Lincoln called “the little woman who made this big war.” She knew her share of tragedy and wrote a great deal more than Uncle Tom’s Cabin.Frederic Remington who put “the West” in our mind’s eye.Teddy Roosevelt in his Medora, North Dakota, incarnation.Louis Agassiz, the Harvard professor who made vast institutional and scientific contributions to zoology, geology, and elsewhere, rooted in his admonition to his students to “look at your fish.”Pioneering pilots Charles and Anne Lindbergh, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry and Beryl Markham.Harry Caudill, the Kentucky lawyer who made strip mining an issue.Dame Miriam Rothschild (yes, of those Rothschilds) who earned international recognition for her study of fleas, was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and collected paintings by schizophrenics.The men who made the Brooklyn Bridge, its designer John A. Roebling, and his son Washington Roebling who erected it. They invented technologies and tools to do it, and put up the longest bridge in the world at the time and, perhaps still, the most beautiful.Conrad Richter, the author who brought the American frontier to the readership of the world.David Plowden, gifted photographer of vanishing industrial and agricultural America.In the introduction, McCullough tells us he found these people much more alike than he imagined before collecting his essays about them into a book. I won’t spoil the fun of discovering just how they were alike or what the significance of that is. However, McCullough also included two speeches at the end, one extolling travel and the other history that drive his main thoughts home."
569,HTML Utopia,Rachel Andrew,3.26,47,6,Bryan Higgs,3,"I bought this book some time ago, and just finally got around to reading it in its entirety.When it was published, this book would have been very good. That was a time (2006) when CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) was just starting to become important in the creation of web sites, and many web developers were used to using plain old HTML tables for their web page layouts. For many reasons, CSS is a far superior way to go, but back then it was taking a while to catch on. So, the focus of this book -- Designing Without Tables Using CSS -- was very relevant, and there were precious few books that covered CSS in this fashion (and they were needed!)This book was the 2nd Edition, and unfortunately there don't seem to be any more recent editions. That's a shame, because the book was very useful indeed, but desperately needs updating. HTML5, CSS3, and many other important technologies have come along in the intervening years (JQuery, as well), and many topics in the book have become out of date. There are lots of references to Internet Explorer 6, and Netscape 4, both of which have, we can only hope, gone away long ago, since they were terribly non-standard and buggy. A whole cottage industry was spawned by these browsers of people who came up with various ""hacks"" to overcome buggy behavior, especially in IE 6.My guess is that this book hasn't been updated to later editions because, nowadays, web developers use CSS all the time, in the ways that this book describes. In other words, the reason for the book's existence might have been seen to have gone away. I disagree, because there are always web developer newbies coming along who need to learn ""the proper way to do things"" (whether they like it or not!). There are too many books that emphasize ""Tricks and Tips"", encouraging people to just cut and paste stuff without understanding it. (That's one sad part of our current culture, in general: Don't bother learning things properly, because it takes too long, and we have to get the product out the door/project finished and don't have time for ""theoretical stuff"". Sigh...)If this book were updated to a new, modern edition, I'd likely give it a much higher star rating. It's still a very useful book, as long as you know that there are more modern things to learn that replace some sections and add to them. I'm not sure what CSS book might be a better choice today -- it would talk about both HTML5 and CSS3, plus JavaScript, including major JavaScript libraries such as JQuery. The problem is that describing all of that is a pretty major task, and there might not be enough readers willing to spend the time and effort learning how all these technologies interact, and how best to use them."
568,The CSS Anthology,Rachel Andrew,3.85,208,21,Bryan Higgs,3,"I read this book just after reading HTML Utopia HTML Utopia by the same author. (See my review https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...).This book suffers from many of the same problems as HTML Utopia -- it's quite out of date. Specifically, it doesn't talk about HTML5 or CSS3 (neither of which were around at the time). Now, at least, the author has published a new edition: The CSS3 Anthology: Take Your Sites To New Heights, 4th Edition which apparently talks about CSS3 and HTML5 ; I haven't read that version, so can't really review it.This book consists of a very short introduction to CSS, and then provides a large number of ""Tips, Tricks and Hacks"" using HTML and CSS. While this is definitely useful, I dislike books that focus on ""tricks and hacks"", since I believe they tend to encourage people to just copy code without understanding it properly. Most of these so-called ""tricks"" are relatively obvious if you understand CSS and how it relates to HTML. If you spent the time to thoroughly understand CSS and HTML, you could probably figure out all these ""tricks"" for yourself. On the other hand, the book does provide a useful background, and does explain how things work pretty well.I suspect that I would give the latest edition of this book a higher star rating, as I presume it is more up to date (although its publish date is March 2012, and a lot has happened since even then)."
570,"HTML, XHTML, and CSS (Visual Quickstart Guide)",Elizabeth Castro,3.81,538,45,Mike,3,"A little over a year ago, my job situation changed slightly as I moved from one capacity into that of the local website manager for our company. I wasn't in charge of any actual coding, just putting the Wordpress CMS to work and helping to build images and content for the site. I decided at some point that using Wordpress wasn't going to be good enough; I wanted to know how the gears worked. Under recommendation from a friend, I picked up a copy of ""PHP 6 and MYSQL 5"" by Larry Ulman and dug in. Then I realized I was going to need some HTML/CSS first, so I grabbed ""HTML, XHTML, and CSS"" by Elisabeth Castro. And dove into that one instead.As a relative newbie to web development via code, I thought the book did a great job of walking me through the basic concepts and giving me the syntax needed to make everything work. It explains the differences betweeen plain HTML and XHTML, the reasons for using the latter, and a good intro to CSS and it's benefits over the older forms of style markup.The problem I had with the book may just be chalked up to my learning style. While she printed plenty of examples and allowed you to download those examples from her site, that didn't really help me. I could have typed out every example, but then I'd be left with a jumble of random pages. In comparison, as I'm starting ""PHP 6..."" I've found the examples to be more instructional; they provide a good walkthrough and well labeled files that you build upon as you go through the book. I guess I would've rather the book walked me through building a basic site, so that when I reached the end, I had a large completed project I could look at and be proud, while having learned something at the same time.In regards to reference, I think it's great. I know I'm going to be coming back to it again and again as I track down a variety of HTML and CSS elements, or just need to use the large color board in the back. If you're after a good reference for HTML and CSS basics, check this book out. But if you're looking for something to help you build a basic site while learning to do so, or that helps you build something and pick it apart to see exactly why it works, this one might not be for you."
5372,"Amber and Ashes (Dragonlance: The Dark Disciple, #1)",Margaret Weis,3.86,2539,73,Katrin,4,"very good book in the dragonlance series! i already liked mina as a character and here she again shines throughout the book. she is a kind of an anti-hero, but so admirable, you simply cannot hate her. there are just a few key figures in the story, but they are very nicely portrayed. i of course loved the kender, haha. this surely is a good start to a gripping story and it's sad that i don't have the following volumes. still i enjoyed this book quite a lot. the only annoying thing is the obvious cliffhangers here, haha!"
5370,Amber Brown Is Green With Envy,Paula Danziger,3.94,765,40,Elle B.,5," This book is a great book written by Paula Danziger, expressing the feelings of a 9 year old girl feeling things, seeing things, and having to understand things that are not things she wants to have to deal with at this age.  Amber’s parents got divorced at the age of 8, and her dad moved away to paris for while to do some work for his job. he came back hoping to get back together with Amber’s mom, but she was not focused on him anymore. She was in love with Max.  Now her dad is being a jerk about Ambers mom having a boyfriend, now Max and Amber’s mom are moving in together, now they are looking for a house, and her dad has a girlfriend, so Amber is confused, and is stuck in the middle of everything that is going on in her family.  This is a great book, because it is more of a feel good book to me. It lets you know that nothing is considered normal, and that there is no such thing as perfect.That is why I give this book 5 stars, because I can relate to this book and i highly recommend that you read this book! "
5512,The Boy Who Loved Anne Frank,Ellen Feldman,3.63,1342,159,Sarah,4,"8/8 - It was interesting reading this because I kept forgetting it wasn't real, that Peter hadn't actually survived the Nazis and made it to America. I was very impressed with the amount of research Feldman put into the story and I really liked the quotes, taken from numerous sources, that started each paragraph. Those quotes gave authenticity to what was happening in the story, they seemed to make Peter fit in to the documented events completely believably.Some of Peter's actions and reactions to life were a bit weird and I found it hard to understand why he did some of the things he did. But then I'm not a survivor of anything (except a few heart operations), so I know that I have no way of knowing how I would behave if I was Holocaust survivor. So while I didn't understand some of his reactions to every day life, I didn't question the legitimacy of any of it, I just found it hard to relate to.At the start I was surprised to read that they had no records of exactly what happened to Peter after the secret annexe was discovered. I was sure I remembered there being the final information for each of the inhabitants of the Secret Annexe in the epilogue or notes at the end of The Diary of Anne Frank. But it has been over a year since I read it, so I figured maybe I was misremembering. It turns out I was not, that Feldman had used the mistake of a tour guide (got to say that's a pretty stupid mistake for a tour guide of the Secret Annexe to make) to create her alternate history. A stupid mistake that lead to a pretty good book that I would recommend to anyone who enjoyed The Diary of Anne Frank or any other piece of literature on the subject."
5381,Eyes of the Dragon,Margaret Leaf,3.79,19,2,"Randie D. Camp, M.S.",3,"The magistrate (a leader) of a Chinese village wanted to protect his people so he had a huge wall built. He was very proud of this accomplishment. The magistrate catches his grandson and other children coloring on the wall, at first he is upset but then he begins to think that he great wall is ""plain."" The magistrate hires a painter to paint a dragon on the wall. The painter accepted the responsibility of painting the dragon but he gave some conditions. What will happen when the magistrate challenges the painter's conditions?The story reads like a folk tale...a long, heavily worded story but we divided into 2 nights and my son really liked the illustrations."
5382,Los ojos del dragón ,Stephen King,3.92,82590,3128,James Lafayette  Tivendale,4,"When the majority of individuals think about Stephen King's credentials; it is generally about his amazing work-rate at producing memorable and top quality horror stories. With that in mind; in addition to The Dark Tower saga, this novel is one of Mr.King's lesser known creations that is definitely more Tolkien than Tommyknockers. It is an easy story to get into and I was intrigued from the first page. My grandfather gave me this book when I was a wide-eyed, eleven-year-old lover of Goosebumps books as I possessed pretty good reading skills for that age and I loved every second of this tale back then. Memories of the book from 19 years ago are of course hazy so I am glad I picked it up again - half for the nostalgia but also to delve back into the mythical land of Delain which lurks somewhere within Mid-World.The book is presented by an omnipresent narrator who may very well be Stephen King himself. This story was written and dedicated to his daughter Naomi after all. The storyteller keeps us updated with his opinions, lets us know the personae's thoughts and motives throughout the plot and reverts back to us as a reader to find out how we are getting on. It is a nice touch for a pleasant story. It follows the royal family of Delain. King Roland the Good is an average monarch. He loves his alcohol, hunting and is just generally an okay guy. He reminded me of Robert Baratheon from Game of Thrones. His defining feat was killing the last known dragon - the head of which remains in his drawing room as a trophy.

5383,Los ojos del dragón,Stephen King,3.92,82590,3128,James Lafayette  Tivendale,4,"When the majority of individuals think about Stephen King's credentials; it is generally about his amazing work-rate at producing memorable and top quality horror stories. With that in mind; in addition to The Dark Tower saga, this novel is one of Mr.King's lesser known creations that is definitely more Tolkien than Tommyknockers. It is an easy story to get into and I was intrigued from the first page. My grandfather gave me this book when I was a wide-eyed, eleven-year-old lover of Goosebumps books as I possessed pretty good reading skills for that age and I loved every second of this tale back then. Memories of the book from 19 years ago are of course hazy so I am glad I picked it up again - half for the nostalgia but also to delve back into the mythical land of Delain which lurks somewhere within Mid-World.The book is presented by an omnipresent narrator who may very well be Stephen King himself. This story was written and dedicated to his daughter Naomi after all. The storyteller keeps us updated with his opinions, lets us know the personae's thoughts and motives throughout the plot and reverts back to us as a reader to find out how we are getting on. It is a nice touch for a pleasant story. It follows the royal family of Delain. King Roland the Good is an average monarch. He loves his alcohol, hunting and is just generally an okay guy. He reminded me of Robert Baratheon from Game of Thrones. His defining feat was killing the last known dragon - the head of which remains in his drawing room as a trophy. In his later years when his subjects are worried at a lack of an heir - he is introduced to a witty, charming, younger lady called Sasha and thanks to a couple of magic potions to aid sexual prowess two children are born.

3679,On Beauty,Zadie Smith,3.69,50559,3968,Kinga,4,"Before we talk about Zadie Smith, let’s talk about me first. Here issomething you should know – I was a serious book-worm up until I turned 16 (more or less) at which point I lost all interest in anything that wasn’t parties, boys, alcohol, drugs or sex. There, I said it. For the next five years my brain didn’t see much action (I somehow managed to finish high school and got accepted into the University of Warsaw but generally I found education a big distraction to my social life). I was about 21 when finally the fog surrounding my brain cleared a little and I decided to go to my local library. I had no idea what to read or how to choose. I was just browsing idly when I saw a book called ‘White Teeth’ with an interesting cover. I checked it out, went home and started reading. Soon I was mesmerized. I had no idea there were books like that, that there were stories like that and that people were telling them. I can’t quite recall now what it was about ‘White Teeth’ that spoke to me so but it was as if a curse was lifted and I could read and use my brain again.For this OCD reason or another, a decade had to pass before I read another Zadie Smith’s book. I am more cynical now and not so easily impressed as I was back then. I felt l could see what Smith was doing there; I was onto all her tricks. Nonetheless, I enjoyed this book tremendously. All this mixing of race, politics, academia, art, love and death – what’s not to love? Even if some of the observations were not particularly revelatory to me I have to give it to Zadie – she knows how to write people. That’s what the characters in ‘On Beauty’ were – people, rather than characters. They were so well put together I feel I would recognize them if I chanced upon them at a party (you know, I still go to parties). Zadie Smith is at the same cruel and merciful towards her subjects. She won’t hesitate to point out all the silliness of their lives but allows us to feel compassion for them and look upon their futile attempts to practice what they preach with forgiveness.Also the climax was quite astonishing. I begin to believe that the ability to write a good climax, to make the reader understand you knew exactly what you were doing from page one is exactly what separates great writers from everybody else. But we shouldn’t forget humour either:‘[…] A brother don’t need a gate – he jumps the fence. That’s street.’‘Again, please?’ said Howard.‘Street, street,’ bellowed Zora. It’s like, “being street”, knowing the street – in Levi’s sad little world if you’re a Negro you have some kind of mysterious holy communion with sidewalks and corners.’And descriptions. Here is my personal favourite (for obvious reasons):The African women in their colourful kenti cloths, the whippet blonde with three phones tucked into the waistband of her trucksuit, the unmistakeable Poles and Russians introducing the bone structure of Soviet Realism to an island of chinless, browless potato-faces, the Irish men resting on the gates of housing estates like farmers at a pig fair in Kerry… Bone structure! You can thank us for that later."
3758,"Casino Royale (James Bond, #1)",Ian Fleming,3.73,47520,3150,Grace Tjan,3,"To: MFrom : Jane MoneypennySubject: An assessment of Agent 007's conduct during operation “Casino Royale”Dear Sir,I am aware of concerns raised by certain members of the Service regarding Agent 007’s performance during the abovementioned operation. Therefore, I would like to offer my personal assessment, based on the debriefing reports and my own long familiarity with the subject.It is true that Agent 007 had somewhat compromised the operation by letting himself getting caught by the Target, otherwise known as “Le Chiffre”. It is also undoubtedly true that he might have compromised the integrity of the valuable intelligence that we gathered by becoming an intimate of No. 3030, a.k.a. Vesper Lynd. However, despite all of that, he had managed to accomplish all of our objectives in the operation, as well as unmasking a potentially dangerous double agent.I can personally vouch that the ‘errors’ that Agent 007 had allegedly committed stemmed not from gross negligence or willful disobedience, but strictly from certain aspects of his character, which are regrettable but perfectly understandable in a man of his persuasion. The most obvious of these is his antipathy toward female operatives, best illustrated by these quotes from the debriefing report:“And there was this pest of a girl. Women were for recreation. On a job, they got in the way and fogged things up with sex and hurt feelings and all the emotional baggage they carried around. One had to look out for them and take care of them.”And also:“These blithering women who thought that they could do a man’s work. Why the hell couldn’t they stay at home and mind their pots and pans and stick to their frocks and gossip and leave men’s work to the men.”Isn’t it patently obvious, sir, that such preconceived notions caused him to fall for the Target’s devious trap? However, he had subsequently paid dearly for such deplorable misogyny by suffering the worst kind of torture known to the male of the species --- a ghastly affair that involved a cane chair with cut out seat, a 3 foot long carpet beater and Agent 007’s naked nether regions --- the details of which is available in the medical report attached to Head of S’s memorandum.Further on, his psychological condition during the long convalescence led him to develop certain feelings for Miss Lynd, to the extent that he was prepared to propose marriage to her. I can assure you that such feelings were genuine (even though he later rather callously repudiated them) and that he truly had honorable intentions toward her. It is obvious from Miss Lynd’s unfortunate reaction that the feeling was mutual.Based on the aforementioned reasons, I propose that we keep Agent 007 in active duty as he had proved that he was able to overcome his personal weaknesses for the good of the Service. Besides, we now have incontrovertible proof that Agent 007 is irresistible to enemy females, a quality that might come handy in future missions that might require such ability.Signed: Second Officer Jane Moneypenny, WRNS.P.S. : Please disregard any insinuation from certain members of the Service (you know who they are, sir) that I have a ‘crush’ on James Agent 007.

3756,James Bond and Moonraker,Christopher Wood,3.6,287,14,Mark,4,"When I first discovered James Bond in the cinema the movie was called ""Moonraker"" and while it made me an immediate fan of Roger Moore as 007 I was somewhat puzzled as the Fleming ""Moonraker"" novel which I rate fairly high had very little in common with the book. Remember this was pre-internet era of globalization as we know it today.Then I found this novelization by Christopher Wood and was pleased to read some more about James Bond as I already had read the Fleming and Markham novels various times, and something new is always welcome.This book is closer to the movie with quite a few more Flemingesque moments written in the book as the movie has. Some of the big plot holes cannot be solved but are comfortable steered clear from. The story is more down to earth than the movie but of course we get into space which is somewhat different from the movie, I admit I liked the events of the movies less than the book offered. But it might have stretched the budget of 'Moonraker"" too far.It is a well written novel which together with 'The spy who loved me"" is actually the best novelization written in the 007-verse. It does surpasses some continuation books easily as well. For a fun 007 adventure recognizable for movie fans you cannot go wrong. The so-called Fleming purist will pull up his nose in horror, but then there are fans and fans."

8175,"Birthright: Christian, Do You Know Who You Are?",David C. Needham,4.24,63,5,Melanie,5,"The concepts in this book are Biblical, but very new to me. I have struggled with the simplicity of the Christian message taught by many people and churches that encourage one to just admit they are a sinner and believe in Christ and you will be saved. In fact, I often ranted about what happens next? Now that I have my “golden ticket”, what am I supposed to do with the rest of my life? Many times people focus on not sinning and doing good deeds. If you are a Christian, but struggle with the hypocrisy of your own life, then this book might help you. The message is one of real hope and true joy. It addresses who you have become and the relationship with God available to you because of Jesus through the Holy Spirit. How we think of ourselves has a huge impact on how we actually live our lives. This book is a big help for understanding what God has to say about who we are. The Author explains these concepts in just the way I needed to hear them. Read it, you won't be disappointed!"
151,Anna Karenina,Leo Tolstoy,4.02,480064,18321,Nataliya,3,"As a daughter of a Russian literature teacher, it seems I have always known the story of Anna Karenina: the love, the affair, the train - the whole shebang. I must have ingested the knowledge with my mother's milk, as Russians would say.............My grandpa had an old print of a painting hanging in his garage. A young beautiful mysterious woman sitting in a carriage in wintry Moscow and looking at the viewer through her heavy-lidded eyes with a stare that combines allure and deep sadness. ""Who's that?"" I asked my grandpa when I was five, and without missing a beat he answered, ""Anna Karenina"". Actually, it was ""A Stranger"" by Ivan Kramskoy (1883) - but for me it has always remained the mysterious and beautiful Anna Karenina, the femme fatale of Russian literature. (Imagine my childish glee when I saw this portrait used for the cover of this book in the edition I chose!) **Yet, ""Anna Karenina"" is a misleading title for this hefty tome as Anna's story is just the tip of an iceberg, as half of the story is devoted to Konstantin Levin, Tolstoy's alter ego (Count Leo's Russian name was Lev. Lev --> Levin), preoccupied with Russian peasantry and its relationship to land, as well as torn over faith and his lack of it, Levin whose story continues for chapters after Anna meets her train. But Anna gives the book its name, and her plight spoke more to me than the philosophical dealings of an insecure and soul-searching Russian landowner, and so her story comes first. Sorry, Leo Levin.Anna's chapters tell a story of a beautiful married woman who had a passionate affair with an officer and then somehow, in her quest for love, began a downward spiral fueled by jealousy and guilt and societal prejudices and stifling attitudes. ""But I'm glad you will see me as I am. The chief thing I shouldn't like would be for people to imagine I want to prove anything. I don't want to prove anything; I merely want to live, to do no one harm but myself. I have the right to do that, haven't I?""On one hand, there's little new about the story of a forbidden, passionate, overwhelming affair resulting in societal scorn and the double standards towards a man and a woman involved in the same act. Few readers will be surprised that it is Anna who gets the blame for the affair, that it is Anna who is considered ""fallen"" and undesirable in the society, that it is Anna who is dependent on men in whichever relationship she is in because by societal norms of that time a woman was little else but a companion to her man. There is nothing new about the sad contrasts between the opportunities available to men and to women of that time - and the strong sense of superiority that men feel in this patriarchial world. No, there is nothing else in that, tragic as it may be.""Anything, only not divorce!"" answered Darya Alexandrovna.""But what is anything?""""No, it is awful! She will be no one's wife, she will be lost!""*No, where Lev Tolstoy excels is the portrayal of Anna's breakdown, Anna's downward spiral, the unraveling of her character under the ingrained guilt, crippling insecurity and the pressure the others - and she herself - place on her. Anna, a lovely, energetic, captivating woman, full of life and beauty, simply crumbles, sinks into despair, fueled by desperation and irrationality and misdirected passion. ""And he tried to think of her as she was when he met her the first time, at a railway station too, mysterious, exquisite, loving, seeking and giving happiness, and not cruelly revengeful as he remembered her on that last moment.""A calm and poised lady slowly and terrifyingly descends into fickle moods and depression and almost maniacal liveliness in between, tormented by her feeling of (imagined) abandonment and little self-worth and false passions which are little else but futile attempts to fill the void, the never-ending emptiness... This is what Tolstoy is a master at describing, and this is what was grabbing my heart and squeezing the joy out of it in anticipation of inevitable tragedy to come.""In her eyes the whole of him, with all his habits, ideas, desires, with all his spiritual and physical temperament, was one thing—love for women, and that love, she felt, ought to be entirely concentrated on her alone. That love was less; consequently, as she reasoned, he must have transferred part of his love to other women or to another woman—and she was jealous. She was jealous not of any particular woman but of the decrease of his love. Not having got an object for her jealousy, she was on the lookout for it. At the slightest hint she transferred her jealousy from one object to another.""Yes, it's the little evils, the multitude of little faces of unhappiness that Count Tolstoy knows how to portray with such sense of reality that it's quite unsettling - be it the blind jealousy of Anna or Levin, be it the shameless cheating and spending of Stiva Oblonsky, be it the moral stuffiness and limits of Arkady Karenin, the parental neglects of both Karenins to their children, the lies, the little societal snipes, the disappointments, the failures, the pervasive selfishness... All of it is so unsettlingly well-captured on page that you do realize Tolstoy must have believed in the famous phrase that he penned for this book's opening line: ""Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.""Tolstoy is excellent at showing that, despite what we tend to believe, getting what you wanted does not bring happiness. ""Vronsky, meanwhile, in spite of the complete realization of what he had so long desired, was not perfectly happy. He soon felt that the realization of his desires gave him no more than a grain of sand out of the mountain of happiness he had expected. It showed him the mistake men make in picturing to themselves happiness as the realization of their desires. ""*And yet, just like in real life, there are no real villains, no real unsympathetic characters that cause obstacles for our heroes, the villains whom it feels good to hate. No, everyone, in addition to their pathetic little ugly traits also has redeeming qualities. Anna's husband, despite appearing as a monster to Anna after her passionate affair, still is initially willing to give her the freedom of the divorce that she needs. Stiva Oblonsky, repulsive in his carelessness and cheating, wins us over with his gregarious and genuinely friendly personality; Anna herself, despite her outbursts, is a devoted mother to her son (at least initially). Levin may appear to be monstrous in his jealousy, but the next moment he is so overwhelmingly in love that it's hard not to forgive him. And I love this greyness of each character, so lifelike and full.And, of course, the politics - so easily forgettable by readers of this book that carries the name of the heroine of a passionate forbidden affair. The dreaded politics that bored me to tears when I was fifteen. And yet these are the politics and the questions that were so much on the mind of Count Tolstoy, famous to his compatriots for his love and devotion to peasants, that he devoted almost half of this thick tome to it, discussed through the thoughts of Konstantin Levin. *Levin, a landowner with a strong capacity for compassion, self-reflection and curiosity about Russian love for land, as well as a striking political apathy, is Tolstoy's avatar in trying to make sense of a puzzling Russian peasantry culture, which failed to be understood by many of his compatriots educated on the ideas and beliefs of industrialized Europe. ""He considered a revolution in economic conditions nonsense. But he always felt the injustice of his own abundance in comparison with the poverty of the peasants, and now he determined that so as to feel quite in the right, though he had worked hard and lived by no means luxuriously before, he would now work still harder, and would allow himself even less luxury.""I have to say - I understood his ideas more this time, but I could not really feel for the efforts of the devoted and kind landowner striving to understand the soul of Russian peasants. Maybe it's because I mentally kept fast-forwarding mere 50 years, to the Socialist Revolution of 1917 that would leave most definitely Levin and Kitty and their children dead, or less likely, in exile; the revolution which, as Tolstoy almost predicted, focused on the workers and despised the loved by Count Leo peasants, the revolution that despised the love for owning land and working it that Tolstoy felt was at the center of the Russian soul. But it is still incredibly interesting to think about and to analyze because even a century and a half later there's still enough truth and foresight in Tolstoy's musings, after all. Even if I disagree with so many of his views, they are still thought-provoking, no doubts about it.""If he had been asked whether he liked or didn't like the peasants, Konstantin Levin would have been absolutely at a loss what to reply. He liked and did not like the peasants, just as he liked and did not like men in general. Of course, being a good-hearted man, he liked men rather than he disliked them, and so too with the peasants. But like or dislike ""the people"" as something apart he could not, not only because he lived with ""the people,"" and all his interests were bound up with theirs, but also because he regarded himself as a part of ""the people,"" did not see any special qualities or failings distinguishing himself and ""the people,"" and could not contrast himself with them.""========================It's a 3.5 star book for me. Why? Well, because of Tolstoy's prose, of course - because of its wordiness and repetitiveness. Yes, Tolstoy is the undisputed king of creating page-long sentences (which I love, by the way - love that is owed in full to my literature-teacher mother admiring them and making me punctuate these never-ending sentences correctly for grammar exercises). But he is also a master of restating the obvious, repeating the same thought over and over and over again in the same sentence, in the same paragraph, until the reader is ready to cry for some respite. This, as well as Levin's at times obnoxious preachiness and the author's frequently very patriarchial views, was what made this book substantially less enjoyable than it could have been. --------By the way, there is an excellent 1967 Soviet film based on this book that captures the spirit of the book quite well (and, if you so like, has a handy function to turn on English subtitles): first part is here, and the second part is here. I highly recommend this film.And even better version of this classic is the British TV adaptation (2000) with stunning Helen McCrory as perfect Anna and lovely Paloma Baeza as perfect Kitty."

8931,Jamie's Dinners: The Essential Family Cookbook,Jamie Oliver,4.07,3934,51,Mdh,5,"When I was in University, I had the best deal in the whole world. I did all the cooking for my roommate, and she did all our dishes. I hate dishes, and she didn’t know how to cook beyond the basics of sandwich making. To be fair, I didn’t really know how to cook either, but I was eager to learn, eager not to do dishes, and I could do slightly more than make a sandwich. I can’t remember who bought me this cookbook, but it was one of the best things that ever happened to me and my roommate.If you’re new to cooking, this book is a great place to start. It’s not that the recipes are necessarily simple, but Oliver’s instructions are fairly detailed. He’s descriptive enough that you feel like you know what you’re looking for at each step, which can be a godsend when you have no idea what it means to make a roux. The book also has a section in the front that gives you a basic recipe and then modifications or extensions for that recipe – like a basic tomato sauce with instructions for pasta, a cassoulet knock off, and some Mediterranean style baked fish, or a method for really good baked potatoes, and then a range of toppings and fillings. There are also recipes for things like a really great onion gravy, which is a nice thing to have in your back pocket. It even has an inventive sandwich chapter!Another great thing about this cookbook for novice cooks are the way he measures some things – a knob of butter, or a wine glass of wine. And he frequently tells you to “chuck it in” or “bash it together.” One of my favourite things about cooking is that most of the time you can eyeball things or tweak a recipe to make it your own. This book gave me a lot of confidence in my own ability to decide the right amount of an ingredient, and not to fret if I’m missing something. The recipes made me feel like cooking food can be something fun that you throw together casually, rather than something that needs to be done with scientific precision. (As you may have gathered, I am not a baker.)I fondly remember hosting a dinner party with recipes entirely from this book – a roasted chicken stuffed with a lemon and thyme sprigs and draped in bacon, roasted potatoes with rosemary and garnished with the crumbled bacon from the chicken, and French peas with more bacon, butter and lettuce. In retrospect, it was perhaps not the most balanced of meals in terms of flavour, but I will never forget proudly bearing that chicken to the table and hacking it apart in front of my awed guests.Now, almost ten years after someone gave me that book, I love cooking, inasmuch as something you have to do to everyday to survive can be, I consider it a hobby. I don’t need this book anymore for it’s detailed instructions (although they’re sometimes nice to have), I still return to it for the proportions for some recipes (the carbonara with bacon and peas is foolproof and creamily comforting) and for some of his more inventive dishes (there is one where chicken breasts are stuffed with banana, topped with bacon, and baked on top of white beans with leeks, cream and white wine – he calls it grotesque, and it is, but it is also delicious). That lemon stuffed chicken has become a standby for my old roommate and I (she learned to cook after all). Even if you’re not new to cooking, I certainly wouldn’t consider this book a waste of time. Perhaps you won’t appreciate his detailed instructions as much, but there are a lot of interesting and delicious recipes in the book."
8921,The Hound of the Baskervilles,Arthur Conan Doyle,4.09,181213,5536,Doug Cannon,4,"My Grandpa Cannon loved this story, and he often told of a time when he went to see a ""picture show"" about the Hound of the Baskervilles. ""It scared the willies out of me,"" he said, and then he and his friend had to part ways as my grandpa rode his bicycle home in the dark.He was thinking about this devil-hound, and then he heard something panting behind him. He pedaled faster and faster, but the panting only got faster and faster too. Then, it was harder and harder to pedal, and his bike was going slower and slower. Just when he thought for sure he was doomed to die and the hound would get him, his bike stopped, the panting stopped, and he found that his back wheel had a flat tire. A flap of rubber had made the panting sound as the air was being released.That has nothing to do with this story, except that it is the reason I read the book. Good book too! Almost as good a story as my grandpa's."
8930,Jamie's Italy,Jamie Oliver,3.99,7055,89,Monika,5,"Even if the recipes weren't wonderful, I love the photos and commentary. But ohmyfrikkingod, the pizza dough alone is worth buying this book.My review over at 101 Cookbooks Library (yes, I am too lazy to retype it):May 12, 2010This is one of my favorite cookbooks, hands down. The photographs are beautiful, the recipes are easy to follow, and you can feel Jamie's passion for this food emanating from every page. This is also one of my toddler's favorite cookbooks - she will thumb through and gaze at each page slowly, taking great care to pick just the right recipe for that evening's meal. "
8934,The Return Of The Naked Chef,Jamie Oliver,4.02,3280,44,Klinta,3,"I love Jamie and his thoughts about veg and home cooking. In this book though everything is so... Italian? Well I don't like pancetta or Parma ham, honestly, I don't like any cured, hard meats. But most of the recipes have them, which is a little sad for my home cooking.And since I have worked in quite a few kitchens now already, some of the things were familiar to me already (but that is not a bad thing, I just got a bit more inspired to do something like that at home as well).Nevertheless, there were few good tips (not particular recipes, but tips and advises) that I stored in my mind and will definitely use. I enjoyed bread and pizza chapter (perhaps because I have always made it like that (thanks, mom)), veg as well, though I thought that is it a little to short, would have loved it, if there would be a bit more stress on it. And funnily enough I liked the fish chapter (although I do not eat fish and the fishes in the pictures looked a bit sad) I have always improvised when I had to cook fish and seems that I have done the right thing."

110,The Road to Dune (Dune Universe),Frank Herbert,3.84,4176,101,Chris ,4,"This was a very entertaining collection of deleted scenes, short stories, and letters about the novel Dune and its sequels. It's definitely one for the Dune enthusiast and probably won't be much use to the casual fan.""Spice Planet"" takes up most of the first half of the book. The cover advertises this as a ""new"" novel by Brian Herbert & Kevin J. Anderson. In reality, it is a short novel length work that they put together based on an outline by Frank Herbert. This outline was a very early draft of what would eventually become Dune. Dubbed ""the alternate Dune"" novel, this is really an early vision of what might have been. The story itself is much different than what Frank Herbert eveutnally published, though there are many recognizable plot points and characters that are kept in the final product. This story on its own was a fun read. The writing is bad in places and quite adolescent in many spots. It seems to lack any kind of editing, which surprised me since Kevin J. Anderson is also a professional editor as well as author. It read like a rough draft. But that being said, the story was very engaging. The characters had cheesy dialogue, but were otherwise well detailed. Perhaps the parallels to Dune helped make them likable, but ""Spice Planet"" on its own is an entertaining story. But let's all be thankful that Frank Herbert kept expanding on his ideas and polished them up to produce the true masterpiece that Dune was.The letters of Frank Herbert and those sent to him about the Dune publishing experience were interesting. It was cool to see the path that the novel took before being accepted and finally published. And you know some of those publishers that rejected the manuscript have to be beating their heads on the wall to this day.The deleted scenes. Well, I compare this section to the typical part of a DVD that has extras. The scenes that were cut from Dune were interesting to read, but there really wasn't anything awe inspiriing. In short, they were cool to read but the original novel didn't lose anything by having them cut. I won't say the same about the scenes from Dune Messiah, though. The last two ""alternate ending"" chapters included here were very interesting, beautifully written, and quite surprising. I think the original Dune Messiah ending was just fine as it was, but these two scenes show how it could have ended. They would have been a good way to end the novel as well, except that they would have screwed up the next novel, Children of Dune.The short stories. Now, these were fun to read. The first one, ""A Whisper of Caladan Seas"" tells the story of a troop of Atreides fighters in the Harkonnen attack in Dune. It's sad and poignant, while giving an air of mystery and intrigue. The writing is a little jagged, which is understandable as it is the first collaboration work between Brian and Kevin.The other three short stories deal with the Butlerian Jihad era, occuring some 10,000 years before Dune. These focus on the war between the ""thinking machines"" and the oppressed humans. I feel sure that Herbert's orginal ideas for this era were a big influence on later works by movie producers such as Battlestar Galactica, The Terminator and The Matrix. These three stories serve as an appetizing introduction to the Legends of Dune series written by Brian & Kevin. As entertaining as they were, I've pushed those books up on my TBR. Great stuff! These stories probably pushed The Road to Dune up to a 4-star rating for me, from the 3-star I was thinking it would get until I read those.My only complaint about this book: the paperback edition was released about a year later and it included a new short story left out of the hardcover edition: ""Sea Child"". Those that buy the more expensive hardcovers should not get less than those that wait a year and buy the cheaper edition. The only way I can get that story now is to buy the paperback. I don't want to spend that kind of money on a single short story, and I don't want to give up my copy when I have the entire Dune library in hardcover. They did this again with the release of their next book, Hunters of Dune. They should at least make those stories available for free as ebooks or something to those that bought the hardcovers."
79,Coming into the Country,John McPhee,4.21,5066,239,Cody,4,"Many of my favorite childhood memories took place in Alaska. It is the most beautiful country I have yet come across and you cannot beat the fly fishing. I've had my eye on this book by John McPhee for quite a while and finally picked it up before my latest trip up to The Country.The book is comprised of three parts. The first, titled The Encircled River, is the strongest. It is easy to detect McPhee's awe for the scenery as he describes a canoe trip with several park rangers down the Salmon and Kobuk Rivers (northwest region of Alaska). This is the section in which McPhee's writing really shines. While he never explicitly tells us this was one of his earliest trips in Alaska, the feelings he describe in the opening section reflect many of mine own upon seeing Alaskan wildlife for the first time (and every time thereafter actually). Reminded me a bit of Graves' ""Goodbye to a River"" but with prettier surroundings. The second part is a bit more historical and covers the State's contemplation of moving the Capital from Juneau to a yet-to-be-determined new location. It is here that McPhee introduces us to the rivalries between different regions and towns of the State (particularly Anchorage and Fairbanks). This is our first glimpse into the Alaskan mindset. This chapter, while interesting, will mostly likely appeal more to those who have already been introduced into the Alaska way of living.The final section focuses on a town in central Alaska known as Eagle. We are introduced to numerous characters (and I do mean characters) that have abandoned city life in favor of peace, quiet and the right to live off the land. Unfortunately this final chapter drags a little, as many of the individual stories start to sound a bit repetitive. Some people might prefer this part of the book more than the other two, however, since this section includes individual survival stories. For the most part a great read. Offers those of us who have been to Alaska a chance to revisit this beautiful country and will (hopefully) inspire others to make the trip when they get a chance."
125,The Power of One: Daisy Bates and the Little Rock Nine,Dennis Brindell Fradin,4.43,28,7,Cristina,4,"Summary of Text“Oft-times it seems that the wheels of justice turn slowly—but turn they must as long as we have young people such as these…exemplifying courage, vision, and dedication not only for the cause of democracy in Arkansas, but that mankind around the world may enjoy dignity and freedom.” In her acceptance speech for receiving the Spingarn Medal in 1958 on behalf of the NAACP, Daisy Bates commends the bravery and commitment of the young “Nine”—the nine black teenagers who enrolled in Little Rock Central High School during its integration in 1957. These nine courageous students faced horrible resistance, violent threats, and physical attacks. The woman who stood behind these students, enduring much of the same kind of abuse, was Daisy Bates. In an account of the events leading up to, through, and following the Little Rock Nine Integration Crisis, Fradin and Fradin depict Bates’ guidance and mentoring of the “Little Rock Nine” as well as her impactful role in the battle for integration and the Civil Rights Movement. Evaluation of Literary MeritsIn The Power of One: Daisy Bates and the Little Rock Nine, Judith and Dennis Fradin chronicle the life experiences of Daisy Bates that led her to become the President of the Arkansas branch of the NAACP and a pivotal figure in the Little Rock Integration Crisis of 1957. This text, however, cannot simply be deemed a “biography,” as it is so much more than an account of one person’s life. Throughout the text, Fradin and Fradin analyze the social unrest in Little Rock, Arkansas, ranging from police brutality and other violent crimes, to Civil Rights struggles including the Supreme Court’s ruling in Brown vs. Board of Education that “separate but equal” is not constitutional and school desegregation. In order to provide accurate and thorough information of this historical period, Fradin and Fradin collected primary documents, consulted numerous texts (books, articles, newspapers, videos), and conducted several interviews in the Arkansas and Chicago areas with Bates’ relatives, members of the “Little Rock Nine,” and other experts with knowledge of the Little Rock Nine Integration Crisis. In addition to the extensive research done for this text, Fradin and Fradin have put together an appropriate, easily accessible, and visually pleasing text for young adult readers. The text includes a clearly organized structure, one that maintains a consistent chronology of the events of the Little Rock Nine Integration Crisis. The authors present an easy-to follow blended text, which flows from narrative to expository and vice versa. In addition, the book maintains typical patterns of organization structure for information text; these are: narrative, descriptive, and sequential. To contribute to the visual aesthetic and overall attractiveness of the text, Fradin and Fradin strategically embed images of primary source documents and archived photographs to support the reader’s understanding of key events, people, places, etc. The authors’ years of personal investment in this text and authority on Daisy Bates’ life and the events of the Little Rock Nine Integration Crisis allows for young adult readers to gain a deep understanding and appreciation of the heroes honored in this book.

123,"The Power of One (The Power of One, #1)",Bryce Courtenay,4.34,61570,4628,Elyse,5,"Wow... incredible!!! I fell in love with Peekay even 'before' he was five years old, starting in South Africa, when he shares of being nursed from his lovely black nanny before being sent to boarding school. ( although we follow him from age 5 to 20 - from the late 1930's to mid 40's).Our oldest daughter attended a boarding High School in Michigan for a short time -an academic/arts school. The family separation was painful. I can't begin to imagine sending a 5 year old away to a boarding school even in the 'best' of conditions.And the fact that this story is inspired by the authors real life....for me, this is one of the most wrenching parts of the entire book....""being sent away from his family at age 5 -- from 'love' he was receiving to 'hatred' he was walking into. Peekay is bullied and abused almost immediately upon arrival as a 5 year old at his boarding school. He's the youngest child in the school. Missing the comfort of his Black nanny ( Peekay is English and white), who would soothe his hurts...missing his mother who was sent away due to a nervous breakdown, Peekay was the first live example of the congenital hate they carried for his kind.  ""The Boer War had created great malevolent feelings against the English, who were called the 'rooineks'. It was a hate that had entered the Afrikaner bloodstream and pocked the hearts and minds of the next generation"". Given that Peekay, spoke English, he pronounced sentences that killed their grandfathers and grandmothers to the world's first concentration camps. Little Peekay had no advance warning that he was wicked before coming to the school. One of the other kids - called 'Judge' abused Peekey regularly. Peekay even made a deal with him to do the Judge's homework and make sure he didn't fail-- but he still continues to abuse him. - really 'tortured him.  We see how Peekay begins to survive- horrific conditions at such a young tender age: Peekay says: ""One thing got to them more than anything else. They could make me cry. Even the Judge, with all of the fear he could provoke, could not make me cry. I suspect they even began to admire me a bit. Many as them brothers my age at home, and they knew how easy it is for a five-year-old to cry. In fact, I had turned six but nobody had told me, so in my head, I was still five"".  ""Not being able to cry was the hardest part for me as well. Crying can't be a good camouflage. In truth, my willpower had very little to do with my resolve never to cry. I had learned a special trick and, in the process, had somehow lost the knack of turning on the tap"". Peekay is a diamond in the rough....an inspiring character. He's smart, open minded, and doesn't have an ounce of bitterness or hatred in him. He develops meaningful friendships with teachers and mentors who teach him to read. He meets a healer, and a boxer. We learn a tremendous amount about boxing. We also learn a lot about the history of South Africa through the eyes of a child. The themes of discrimination were well defined by the author: the Boers vs. the English - South Africans vs. the Germans - the Jews vs. the Germans - white Africans vs. the Black Africans. Violence is graphic - so be warned. It's a cruel and beautiful world we live in! "
113,"Dune (Dune Chronicles, #1)",Frank Herbert,4.19,533287,13533,Manny,4,"There's a characteristically witty essay by Borges about a man who rewrites Don Quixote, many centuries after Cervantes. He publishes a novel with the same title, containing the same words in the same order. But, as Borges shows you, the different cultural context means it's a completely new book! What was once trite and commonplace is now daring and new, and vice versa. It just happens to look like Cervantes's masterpiece.Similarly, imagine the man who was brave or stupid enough to rewrite Dune in the early 21st century. Like many people who grew up in the 60s and 70s, I read the book in my early teens. What an amazing story! Those kick-ass Fremen! All those cool, weird-sounding names and expressions they use! (They even have a useful glossary in the back). The disgusting, corrupt, slimy Harkonnens - don't you just love to hate them! When former-aristo-turned-desert-guerilla-fighter Paul Muad'Dib rides in on a sandworm at the end to fight the evil Baron and his vicious, cruel nephew, of course you're cheering for him. Who the hell wouldn't be?So that was the Dune we know and love, but the man who rewrote it now would get a rather different reception. Oh my God! These Fremen, who obviously speak Arabic, live on a desert planet which supplies the Universe with melange, a commodity essential to the Galactic economy, and in particular to transport. Not a very subtle way to say ""oil""! They are tough, uncompromising fighters, who are quite happy to use suicide bombing as a tactic. They're led by a charismatic former rich kid (OK, we get who you mean), who inspires them to rise up against the corrupt, degenerate... um, does he mean Westerners? Or only the US? And who is Baron Harkonnen intended to be? I'm racking my brains... Dubya doesn't quite seem to fit, but surely he means someone? Unless, of course, he's just a generic stereotype who stands for the immoral, sexually obsessed West. This is frightening. What did we do to make Frank al-Herbert hate us so much? You'd have people, not even necessarily right-wingers, appearing on TV to say that the book was dangerous, and should be banned: at the very least, it incites racial hatred, and openly encourages terrorism. But translations would sell brilliantly in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, and a bad movie version would soon be made in Turkey.I honestly don't think Herbert meant any of that; but today, it's almost impossible not to wonder. If anyone reading this review is planning to rewrite The Tale of Benjamin Bunny, you'd better make sure you get your timing right. Who knows how it will be interpreted five years from now?"
8527,The Edge,Dick Francis,3.99,3754,184,Kwoomac,3,"This was not one of my favorite Dick Francis novels and it tool me awhile to sort out why. It certainly had all the right components in the protagonist, Tor Kelsey. Orphaned (sort of): check. Average guy with above average talents: check. Instalove with slow build up: check. Clever bad guy: check. Even more clever good guy: check.. So what was missing? For me, it was the lack of a relationship between Tor and the bad guy. Julius Apollo Filmer (bad guy) doesn't even know Tor exists. Tor works for the Jockey Club as a sort of ""invisibles man"" who effortlessly wanders race courses in disguise, looking for people breaking the rules. No one knows he exists and the lawbreakers are always stunned when they get caught. Filmer is good at getting other owners to turn their horses over to him. The owners are afraid to tell the Jockey Club why. One owner kills himself, a stable lad who hints at knowing what Filmer is doing turns up dead. When Filmer joins a Canadian train trip for racehorse owners, the Canadian Jockey Club decides to employ Tor to thwart whatever Filmer is planning. In addition to three horse races along the route, there is also a mystery being played out during the ride. Remember when those staged mysteries were popular? The book was a lot of fun but there was very little tension, as Filmer didn't know of Tor's existence, so he was really never at risk. I generally enjoy Francis' s ability to write an interesting nemesis for our hero to take down, but this one was a little too removed for my taste. It's like if someone tells you about something horrific that happened to a friend of a friend of a friend...just a little too far removed to really kick you in the gut (or maybe that's me being cold blooded). Anyway, not quite enough bang for my buck here."
8531,Proof,Dick Francis,4.02,5132,182,Harry,5,"What is there to say about Dick Francis? As I think about all of his books (yes, this review covers all of his books, and yes I've read them all) I think about a moral ethical hero, steeped in intelligence and goodness embroiled in evil machinations within British horse racing society - either directly or indirectly. The heroes aren't always horse jockies, they can be film producers, or involve heroes engaged in peripheral professions that somehow always touch the horse racing world.But more than that, Francis's heroes are rational human beings. The choices made are rational choices directed by a firm objective philosophy that belies all of Francis's novels. The dialogue is clear and touched with humor no matter the intensity of evil that the hero faces. The hero's thoughts reveal a vulnerability that is touching, while his actions are always based on doing the right thing to achieve justice. Causing the reader to deeply care about the characters in a novel is a difficult thing to do. No such worries in a Francis novel. The point of view is first person, you are the main character as you read the story (usually the character of Mr. Douglas). The hero is personable, like able, non-violent but delivering swift justice with his mind rather than through physical means. This is not to say that violence is a stranger to our hero. Some of it staggering and often delivered by what we would think of normal persons living in British society.You will come to love the world of Steeple Chase racing, you will grow a fondness for horses, stables, trainers and the people who live in that world. You will read the books, devouring one after the other and trust me Dick Francis has a lot of novels (over 40 by my last count).There are several series woven into the fabric of Francis's work: notably the Sid Halley and Kit Fielding series.Assessment: Dick Francis is one of my favorite writers. I read his books with a fierce hunger that remains insatiable and I mourn his death."
8530,Risk,Dick Francis,3.92,2621,80,Algernon,4,"Risk is one of the better titles in the Dick Francis catalogue, one that I recommend to readers as yet unfamiliar with his opus as a showcase of his abilities as a storyteller. As usual, it is told in first person by a likable character that looses no time in getting under the reader's skin and gaining his sympathy. How's this for an opening line: Thursday, March 17, I spent the morning in anxiety, the afternoon in extasy and the evening unconscious. Read on to find out how the fortunes of Roland Britten, up-and-coming young accountant and amateur steeplechase jockey, rise and fall from one moment to another, with the regularity of a  montagne-russe  ride. A rather lengthy opening sequence describes Roland's attempts to escape from being kidnapped for unknown reasons. The time is well spent for getting acquainted with his level headed approach to problem solving, his ingenuity and his stoical acceptance of things out of his control (  When things go bad, you endure what you must, and thank God it's not worse. ). Back in England (come on, you knew he would escape, Francis is not George R R Martin to snuff out his main character in the middle of the story!), Roland tries to put back the pieces of his life and return to the routine of balancing accounts, auditing tax declarations and sneaking off to ride in another weekend race. With the usual thorough research, Francis makes the rather boring activity of adding up columns of numbers into a glamorous and dangerous pastime. The mysterious bad guys are not finished with Roland and the plot thickens with the introduction of a trio of ex-convicts as potential suspects (sent down by Roland himself for fraud) plus assorted trainers, horse owners, bookmakers and racegoers. Complications of a romantic nature with a rather ripe and plain school mistress ( I wonder though what kind of school the author went to?) competing for Roland affections with the young and lively daughter of one of his clients.I have read so many of Dick Francis thrillers that I am now able to spot the bad guy from his first or second appearance on the scene. With Risk, I am discovering it doesn't do to become overconfident, as the author is still capable of pulling a fast one on me ((view spoiler)[ I was right about his boss being crooked, but didn't see the mastermind that organized the kidnapping, and also didn't cotton on to the fact a whole coterie of baddies might be involved, as in Agatha Christie's classic Orient Express murder  (hide spoiler)]). The finale is typical Francis, brains and resilience (  Endurance is like tax. You're silly to pay more than you have to, but you can't always escape it. And you can whine, or suffer with good grace. ) versus violent ruthlessness and greed, leaving me with a feelgood smile pasted on my face and a little more hope in my fellow humans. In the introduction, critic H. R.F. Keating says Francis scores equally with professors of logic reading in the train from Oxford and children reading under the desk at school. I find myself in agreement with him, and look forward to keep reading these books as I get older."
8529,Reflex,Dick Francis,4.05,4651,136,Algernon,5,"Warning!!! Fanboy rating !I’ve been reading and re-reading the novels of Dick Francis since the early 1990’s and I’m hardly objective when it comes to judging their worth. I am aware that many critics consider him a ‘one trick pony’ who somehow stumbled over a succesful formula for writing murder mysteries set in and around the racing world, and then applied ‘rinse and repeat’ for about forty more novels written in the same manner, with the same type of characters and the same type of plot. Yet for me they are more comfort reads than guilty pleasure, as sure a thing to pick me up when I’m blue as a P G Wodehouse romp through a country manor.My all time favorite remains  Whip Hand , which is also the first one I read, before the formula became apparent. It’s due for a re-read, but what I wanted to point out is that  Reflex  comes very close on the heels of number one in my preferences. Francis must have been on a good roll, as I noticed the two books were published in the same year (1981). In support of my rating I make note of :-	there is actual steeplechase racing in the book, as Philip Nore, the protagonist, is still active on the racetrack as an amateur jockey-	by now Dick Francis became aware that he needed to diversify his set-ups with other passions / interests and other avenues of investigation into the murders. In Reflex this hobby horse is photography, which plays right up into my own interests in the subject.-	the plot is less linear and predictable than usual, as there are multiple avenues of investigation and more than one adversary / puzzle to be solved-	there is a romantic complication, treated as usual with understated intensity and delicacy of touch (I’m starting to give credit to the rumours that the wife of the author was involved in one form or another in the production of his novels)Briefly, the novel starts with Philip Nore being asked to throw off a race by a venal owner with the tacit acceptance of the horse’s trainer. Simultaneously, Philip tries to help a fellow jockey whose father died recently in a suspicious car crash. This man, George Millace, was one of the best racing photographers, a passion that Philip shares as an enthusiast amateur who likes to carry his camera everywhere he goes in the hope he will stumble on a good subject or a good trick of the light. The son and widow of Millace are soon dealing with aggravation as their house is burgled first and then set on fire. It looks like somebody is looking for damaging images that the dead man was using to blackmail the crooks who can usually be found wherever apparently easy money attract crowds of the general public. A third storyline has Philip visiting his terminally ill grandmother and being required to find out a sister he never even knew he had.Philip is everything I have come to expect from a Dick Francis hero : a bit of a loner, self-reliant and perseverent, whipsmart yet modest, with a strong inner compass about right and wrong, even as he admits that making a living in the racing world sometimes requires compromise. He’s got a fine sense of humour and an easy, laidback demeanour that makes people underestimate him at their own peril. A difficult childhood spent in various improvised foster homes as his teenage mother is chasing drugs and parties at the height of the Flower Power rage, turns Philip in compensation into a seriousminded and independent adult who knows how to find happiness in the simple things in life, like running over fences at breakneck speed. Most people think, when they’re young, that they’re going to the top of their chosen world, and that the climb up is only a formality. Without that faith, I suppose, they might never start. Somewhere on the way they lift their eyes to the summit and know they aren’t going to reach it; and happiness then is looking down and enjoying the view they’ve got, not envying the one they haven’t. Philip knows he will never be the best jockey out there, but he is willing to give it his best, for as long as he is allowed to. But as he cannot accept to cheat as he is required, he needs a fallback option. This may come from the photography that he has until now considered just an expensive hobby. This hobby may be turned into a profitable career, or it may terminate his life in a brutal manner, as he accidentally comes in possession of the late George Millace compromising images. These photographs are cleverly hidden in plain sight, as underexposed film or junk prints full black or full white, or transparent plastic. The quest of Philip to reveal the secret in the throwaway box of the dead photographer was probably the most interesting part of the novel for me, as I had some personal experience with developing film and printing out on paper in my own bathroon laboratory, back before digital made all this stuff obsolete. I was also reminded of the movie  Blow Up  by Michelangelor Antonioni, another story woven around a crime and an investigative photographer. Beside the familiarity with the equipment and the techniques, I have also shared in Philip’s worries about the prospects of making money from my hobby: Everyone took photographs, every family had a camera, the whole Western world was awash in photographers ... and to make a living at it one had to be exceptionally good. One also had to work exceptionally hard. and in another place: I would never be a salesman.Taking photographs for a living, I thought ruefully, would find me starving within a week. I think I’ll hang on to my day job for a while longer...Coming back to the novel, the romance when it blooms may be a little abrupt, but again, I know it can happen in this unplanned and often irrational way. I could not find it in me to be grumpy or coldly analytical about Philip putting his heart at risk: It began in friendship and progressed to passion. Ended in breathlessness and laughter, sank to murmurs and sleep. If I were to find something to criticize about the plot, it is the fact that I could spot the bad guys a mile off, another drawback of reading too many of the Francis novels. Almost all his fictional bad guys are cast from the same mould, which makes me wonder sometimes if there is any basis in reality, some bully that marked his early years or his later career so strongly that he goes back to the master copy in every book he writes: A bully boy on the march, power hungry and complacent, a trampler of little men. With this image of the quinetessential bully I come to my last quote, and one of the explanations of the appeal the books of Dick Francis still hold for me: he believes in the power of good men and women to stand up and defeat the takers and the violent and the ruthless who believe the world belongs to the wolves: Most people’s lives, I thought, weren’t a matter of world affairs, but of the problems right beside them. Not concerned portentously with saving mankind, but with creating local order: in small checks and balances.Neither my life nor George Millace’s would ever sway the fate of nations, but our actions could change the lives of individuals: and they have done that. Recommended to readers as yet unfamiliar with the novels of Dick Francis as a good gateway drug, and to the fans as one of his better offerings."
8528,Rat Race,Dick Francis,3.92,2340,89,James Thane,3,"This is a fairly typical Dick Francis novel. In this case, the loner, withdrawn protagonist is a pilot, Matt Shore, who once flew for BOAC but who is now reduced to flying puddle-jumper charters. It's not initially clear why this is the case. Like a lot of Francis's heros, Shore has also recently been divorced and is very gun-shy regarding women, although inevitably a beautiful and desirable woman will soon be practically dropped into his lap.Matt flies a party of four to a race meet and only a minute or so after they land, the plane explodes. It's a narrow escape, and luckily no one is hurt. But several other incidents follow and it appears that someone may be targeting a prominent jockey who frequently flies with Matt. As usual, there's a dark sinister force lurking in the background pursuing a foul agenda irrespective of the cost in lives or in property damage. Matt will have to sort all of this out and tame his own demons as well if he hopes to bring the mystery and his own personal circumstances in for a happy landing. Anyone who enjoys Francis's work could spend a pleasant evening with this book."
8526,Shattered,Dick Francis,3.89,4434,175,Maria V. Snyder,3,"I started reading Dick Francis when I was 14 years old and looking for a mystery in the library. The cover of the first one I read looked intriguing, the title, Nerve seemed interesting, and the synopsis about a jockey who has lost his nerve made me add it to my pile of books. After that I was hooked, reading his novels until I caught up on his entire back-list and then had to wait a year for the new one. I traveled to see him and his lovely wife every year to get books signed and, as he aged, I started stockpiling his books. I didn't want to read them until I had a few saved up. I had three left when he passed away :( (not including the ones co-written with his son, Felix - I tried to read that one...).Last week I decide to treat myself to one of the three I've saved. Well, I'm older and have written a few cough...fourteen....cough novels and teach writing at an MFA program cough...Seton Hill University...cough. The story and characters were great it's just the magic...well, it's gone for me. And I don't know if it's because his later books were written without his lovely wife helping (although the research about glassblowing was spot on) or because he was in his 80s or if it's because I'm older and more experienced. I recently listened to Odds Against and loved it so I guess I need to re-read one of this older titles and see - although I'm kinda reluctant to mess with my memories.This has turned into a rather long-winded review! As for the story - it's a bit dated mystery with a number of parties searching for a VHS tape - there needs to be more emotions and the ending was rushed. I guessed a number of things, but it's hard to surprise me. It's a quick read and overall enjoyable."
8533,Slay Ride,Dick Francis,3.77,2198,74,Harry,5,"What is there to say about Dick Francis? As I think about all of his books (yes, this review covers all of his books, and yes I've read them all) I think about a moral ethical hero, steeped in intelligence and goodness embroiled in evil machinations within British horse racing society - either directly or indirectly. The heroes aren't always horse jockies, they can be film producers, or involve heroes engaged in peripheral professions that somehow always touch the horse racing world.But more than that, Francis's heroes are rational human beings. The choices made are rational choices directed by a firm objective philosophy that belies all of Francis's novels. The dialogue is clear and touched with humor no matter the intensity of evil that the hero faces. The hero's thoughts reveal a vulnerability that is touching, while his actions are always based on doing the right thing to achieve justice. Causing the reader to deeply care about the characters in a novel is a difficult thing to do. No such worries in a Francis novel. The point of view is first person, you are the main character as you read the story (usually the character of Mr. Douglas). The hero is personable, like able, non-violent but delivering swift justice with his mind rather than through physical means. This is not to say that violence is a stranger to our hero. Some of it staggering and often delivered by what we would think of normal persons living in British society.You will come to love the world of Steeple Chase racing, you will grow a fondness for horses, stables, trainers and the people who live in that world. You will read the books, devouring one after the other and trust me Dick Francis has a lot of novels (over 40 by my last count).There are several series woven into the fabric of Francis's work: notably the Sid Halley and Kit Fielding series.Assessment: Dick Francis is one of my favorite writers. I read his books with a fierce hunger that remains insatiable and I mourn his death."
8525,Dead Cert,Dick Francis,3.95,4808,137,James Thane,3,"First published in 1962, this is the book that started Dick Francis on his career as a novelist. Francis was forty-two at the time, a veteran of World War II, and a former steeplechase jockey himself. Virtually all of his novels take place in and around the world of British horseracing. While he repeats the same character only a couple of times, virtually all of his protagonists are the same sort of man--relatively young, intelligent, determined, courageous, and somewhat aloof--at least until the point where they might the right woman and then, often as not, it's love at first sight.Early on in the course of each novel, the protagonist discovers some glaring injustice and determines to investigate. Inevitably, he antagonizes the wrong person and finds his own health and well-being in grave jeopardy. Often there is some powerful, sinister force, directing events from behind the scene, and our hero must root him out. In this case, the protagonist is Alan York, an amateur steeplechase rider. He comes from a moneyed family in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), and when he's not riding, he works in this father's shipping firm in London.As the book opens, York is riding in a race alongside his best friend, Bill Davidson, who is riding a horse called Admiral. Davidson and Admiral are the heavy favorites in the race, a ""dead cert"" to win. But then, at the back of the course, Admiral trips over a fence. The horse goes down on top of Davidson, who will die as the result of the injury. York, riding right behind Davidson, saw something suspicious just before his friend fell. After the race, York goes back to the jump where Davidson fell and discovers that someone had stretched a wire across the top of the jump, causing the horse to fall and Davidson to be fatally injured.By the time York can get someone in authority to examine the scene, the wire has been removed and there is no evidence that the horse was deliberately tripped. York knows this to be the case, however, and begins his own investigation. He discovers that someone has been attempting to fix races and the deeper he gets into the investigation, the more trouble he finds himself in. Before long, he discovers that he's in a contest of wills against a very dangerous adversary who will stop at nothing to preserve his criminal enterprise.All in all, it's a good story. As in all of these books, one learns a great deal about the world of British horse racing, and the novel should appeal to anyone who enjoys classic British crime fiction."
9087,House,Frank E. Peretti,3.6,19946,1477,J. Kent Messum,1,"I keep practically every book I ever read......I didn't keep this one though. (Update: I was going to leave it at the two lines above since I'm not particularly fond of a giving a book a bad review, but I just can't let this one get away without giving it a damn good spanking. And so...)I've read a lot of bad books in my time. And I've probably read worse that this one. But whenever someone asks me what the most terrible book I ever read was, 'House' inevitably springs to mind. To this day I still can't get over what I steaming pile of shit this novel was, written by TWO acclaimed authors no less. How something like this goes on to sell thousands and thousands of copies is beyond me.... but we do live in the age where '50 Shades Of Grey' is the top-selling book of all time... so maybe I shouldn't be all that surprised.I find it hard to describe this book without vulgarity, probably because it was an utter waste of my fucking time and extraocular muscles. I won't bore you with the details (and trust me, you'd be sleep-drooling on your keyboard in no time), but the plot walks face first into walls, the characters make cardboard look like personality plus, the writing is such drivel that it would embarrass most authors, and the ending of the story is the kind that should surely end a writer's career on the same note.Oh, 'House' is a horror novel all right; I was truly horrified that something like this got published and popularized. When I was done with it I thought about giving the book away to a thrift store, but then felt so bad about passing this waste of wood along and subjecting anyone else to the torment, like it was the videotape in 'The Ring' or something.The only time I ever think it would have been wise to keep this book around is on the odd occasion I unexpectedly run out of toilet paper."
427,Miami,Joan Didion,3.7,876,83,orsodimondo,4,"SI PREGA L'ULTIMO AMERICANO A LASCIARE MIAMI DI PORTARE CON SÉ LA BANDIERAMiami è la città cubana con il più alto numero di popolazione bianca statunitense (anglos). La ridotta distanza dall’isola, le consente di essere per certi versi parte dell’isola: si può partire da Miami con un buon motoscafo per andare a prendere l’aperitivo all’Avana e rientrare in nottata (Miami Vice, il film di Michael Mann).Gong Li e Colin Farrell prendono il motoscafo da Miami per andare a bere un mohito a L’Avana nel film di Michael Mann (2006). Mann è stato produttore esecutivo anche nelle cinque stagioni della serie, che ha contribuito a creare e alla quale ha impresso per così dire il suo marchio di fabbrica.Joan Didion la racconta nella sua mirabile maniera, collegando fatti apparentemente distanti, intervistando e incontrando una quantità impressionante di persone, usando acume e ironia a volontà: la racconta nel corso del Novecento, ma soprattutto a partire dagli anni Sessanta, quando JFK ‘tradì’ gli immigrati cubani con la nota sòla della Baia dei Porci, diventando l’uomo più odiato al mondo dopo Fidel Castro; e la racconta ancora più a fondo negli anni Settanta e Ottanta, il periodo in cui lei scrive e pubblica questo reportage.Per capire e godere il libro a fondo ho rivisto Scarface di De Palma con un indimenticabile Al Pacino nella parte del protagonista Tony Montana (Tony: Accontentati tu, io prendo tutto, tutto quello che posso; l’amico Manny: E cosa vuoi tu? ; Tony: Il mondo chico... e tutto quello che c'è dentro. E ancora, Tony, colpito da decine di pallottole, piomba nella fontana che arreda l’ingresso della sua casa, con il neon The World Is Yours che rimane l’ultima immagine del film…). The eyes, chico, never lie!Tony Montana rappresenta la seconda ondata massiccia di emigrazione cubana: nel 1980 Castro lasciò libertà di fuga, e 125 mila persone ne approfittarono per abbandonare l’isola dal porto di Mariel e approdare a Miami, tra le braccia di parenti e amici, ma soprattutto tra le braccia dei poliziotti USA che li rinchiusero nei campi organizzati dal governo – anche perché il ‘regalo’ di Castro comprendeva un cospicuo numero di esuli rilasciati dalle prigioni e dagli ospedali psichiatrici cubani (Jimmy Carter non ha mai dimenticato questo scherzo del dittatore cubano). È quell’ondata migratoria passata alla storia sotto il soprannome di banana boat.Lo spagnolo è la seconda lingua nazionale negli US: ma in tutto il paese è essenzialmente la lingua della classe bassa, dei giardinieri, dei camerieri, dei facchini… A Miami è diverso: Gli esuli che a New York o a Los Angeles si sentivano discriminati, isolati a causa della lingua che parlavano, a Miami erano sulla cresta dell’onda. Un imprenditore che non parlava inglese a Miami poteva comunque, comprare, vendere, negoziare, fare leva sui suoi punti di forza, speculare in borsa e, se ne aveva voglia, andare in smoking a un paio di galà a settimana.Didion chiama Miami la città ""spettacolarmente depressa"" dove le vanità dell'Avana vanno a morire. Racconta la tristeza de Miami fatta di donne con vestiti di seta e sandali col tacco, che si asciugano gli occhi dietro gli occhiali scuri: sembra appartenere specificamente a Miami. Quella degli esuli cubani a Miami è una comunità politicamente artefatta che ha vissuto diversi decenni in una favola o dentro un'opera teatrale: la trama (ai loro occhi) era il tradimento subito.Parla dell'exilio come di un rituale, una tradizione rispettata, e una visione della politica così centrale per la condizione umana che per descriverla sembravano non esserci parole adatte nel vocabolario della maggior parte degli americani. L'invasione della baia dei Porci fu organizzata dalla CIA durante l'amministrazione Eisenhower, con tanto di addestramento militare di esuli cubani, ma Kennedy diventato presidente decise di non sostenere il piano. L’esercito sconfisse la forza d'invasione in soli tre giorni di combattimentiE intanto mette a fuoco i meccanismi che per più di vent'anni (dall'amministrazione Kennedy a quella Reagan), hanno guidato la politica di Washington.Un libro sulla politica di Washington, lo definisce Joan Didion, spiegando che tutto ciò che a Miami ha assunto la forma di ‘esilio cubano’ è stato generato dalle promesse fatte e non mantenute da Washington, ben rappresentate da quella di un'invasione sfociata poi nella Baia dei Porci.Ma come molta della produzione letteraria della Didion, è prima di tutto un libro sull’arroganza di Washington e l’intossicazione da potere (I diritti umani, che sono un concetto culturalmente e politicamente relativo…devono essere messi da parte e rimpiazzati da una politica [non interventista] di realismo etico e politico, si legge nei documenti di una commissione parlamentare dell’epoca reaganiana).Quell’arroganza infarcita di follia che, per esempio, come fosse uscita direttamente da “Catch 22” di Joseph Heller, permetteva che le operazioni autonome facevano parte della cosiddetta strategia di “livello due” che, anche se non si sapesse bene cosa volesse dire in teoria, di fatto significava che la JURE (Junta Revolucionaria Cubana) poteva per esempio richiedere e ottenere esplosivi e granate dalla CIA anche se per il “livello uno” la stessa JURE risultava sotto inchiesta da parte dell’FBI per possesso illegale di armi da fuoco.Joan Didion e la figlia Quintana Roo"
428,Play It as It Lays,Joan Didion,3.86,18907,1463,Jeffrey Keeten,4,"“There was silence. Something real was happening: this was, as it were, her life. If she could keep that in mind she would be able to play it through, do the right thing, whatever that meant.” Joan DidionWhenever Maria called, it was as if the ringing of the phone heralded the end of any conviviality I might have been harboring. I always had the impression when I talked with her that the Fun to Be Around Maria was dying in another room, and all I was left with was the beautiful corpse. She was beautiful. Even though we had all seen changes to her appearance recently. So beautiful, in fact, she could still get acting jobs without too much trouble. I could see this all ending soon because she was so morose that her mood permeated the whole movie set. She had become so lost, so indifferent to everything. She was a zombie, long before Hollywood became infatuated with them. Her relationship with men was not particularly complicated. They wanted to sleep with her, and she was rather indifferent as to whether she slept with them or not. When we had first met, I’d “seduced” her while blinded by her glamour and allurement. It was only after we were entangled that I realized that all of that was only skin deep. “By the end of the week she was thinking constantly about where her body stopped and the air began about the exact point in space and time that was the difference between Maria and other.”She had leaned on one elbow and shared that revelation with me. Her hair was still rummaged from my fingers. Her lipstick was smeared from my lips. There was something gone from her. The worms in her head had eaten into the core of her. The flame that had made her a star was nothing, but ashes. I left her with vestiges of misery clinging to me as if I’d been tainted by her own unhappiness. But we remained friends.I worried about her and worried about myself whenever I knew I had to see her. Things weren’t going well with her husband, Carter, or with her other lovers for that matter. They all were finding it harder to find the woman that first made them want her. Her mantra of late was: “I know what ""nothing"" means, and keep on playing.”Her circle of friends continued to take her calls because we were all afraid that by not answering we might be putting her life in danger. Someone so miserable had to be suicidal. It was like a guillotine hanging over all of us, waiting for her to decide when and how. It was frustrating to see someone who had been given so much not being able to find any way to enjoy the life that many desired. I’d been drinking one night after losing yet another part that would have insured many years of future success when she called. Her unhappiness fueled the fire of my own dejection. I heard myself scream into the phone, “For all our sakes just get it over with.” I’d slammed the phone down and poured myself a couple of fingers more of scotch. I couldn’t afford to know Maria anymore. It was too debilitating, too disheartening, and inspired too many ugly thoughts of resentment. I wanted her melancholy to be left to song. Remorse wrapped crumpled newsprint around all my further thoughts.

477,The Collapse of Complex Societies,Joseph A. Tainter,4.13,616,79,Mark,5,"Ok, done!Tainter's work is an opus. How could it be otherwise with a title like that? Yet, it lives up to the title: aiming and broadly succeeding to argue the causes for collapse. It's a little ponderous to read, because it is documented and reasoned like a thesis. This is a historical analysis, with applicability to our age that's noted only lightly along the way: it's not a political position paper, though it could be.Tainter says diminishing returns eventually trap civilization in a no-win situation. The idea of diminishing returns (well explored) meaning that more fertilizer, internet, railroads and regulations produce more food per man-hour invested, but only to a point. Eventually the return on investment tapers to nothing, and then further effort would actually COST energy, blood and treasure. ...and critically, you can't go back.I don't think he successfully argues why we can't step back from that precipice, why for instance the diminishing returns aren't their own regulator, moreso because the broad curve of lost benefit implies a smooth hilltop, not a cliff (My precipice description makes Tainter's point, but it seems inaccurate to describe the actual dynamics.) It seems pretty simple negative feedback: the farmer eventually looks at a JET powered tractor, (plows 20% faster, but uses 3x the gas) & thinks, ""no thanks."" There IS a valid issue of ""measurement delays"" though. Maybe when you're a city planner contemplating a bridge too far it's not obvious that it's total cost/value is a losing proposition. Surely there will someday be one road too many, if not already!Another possibility (I'm trying to cinch down the last loose knot on his thesis, you see) is that the complexity is a house of cards. A famous ""cappuccino"" speech (by Greenspan) trumpets the hyper-complicated chain of products that enables something as wonderful and only SEEMINGLY simple as a cappuccino: where'd the ore for the selenium cobalt in the magnets in the electric motor that ground the beans come from? If our system is interdependent (and surely it is for is not the efficiency derived substantially from specialization that interdependence allows?) then perhaps because of fragility it cannot regress to a simpler time. There is no retrenchment possible; removing a keystone will bring it all down, and every stone is a keystone.A final idea I'll offer is that we become addicted. Not in a bad way either. We are addicted in that we want to support our population: it's not o.k. with us if people die. But that's what will happen because, as we expand our capability (e.g. the green revolution that fed Asia), we respond by literally eating up that excess capacity. Some of it goes into luxury, but lots goes into people too, and we are thereby committed to the additional technology. I heard a great study about a lane mover that would increase one way traffic on the I-70 corridor during ski season. 50% less crowds? No, the crowds will respond, said the analysis, and it'll just be 50% more people skiing, with the same traffic jam as ever. I believe it! We invent an improvement and then gobble up it's benefit instead of banking it away against lean times. So the change becomes not really an improvement, but instead a permanent commitment to additional infrastructure, additional complexity. In Skinner's Walden II they lived a life of ease founded upon 30% more efficient work habits. Why then don't I live a life of ease with (the US average) 10kW at my disposal? That's the equivalent of a dozen horses, working for me 24/7. The answer is that we use it up. Also I suppose I DO live a life of ease and luxury in comparison to a 19th century Russian peasant with only one actual horse in his stable. Anyway, Tainter does talk about this obliquely at one point.Re-reading my review a year later, both Tainter's analysis and mine leave me uncomfortable, unsatisfied. Trying to be succinct, I don't think it's about diminishing returns, but about slack and momentum. Consumption of all the slack technology provides leads to an irrevocable commitment to complexity and interdependency. ""Commitment"" is the mouths to feed, and it's the inertia you need to make instability possible. Commitment means you can't retrench to simpler technology in a bad year because the greater efficiency has become the new minimum baseline. Now you're in danger of actual collapse.One more last thought (how many ""last thoughts"" is one allowed?) is that maybe the famous hidden ""negative externalities"" provide the extra lag in measurement that could trip us over the self limiting point of diminishing returns and into an unsustainable vicious cycle of collapse. The farmer buying the fast tractor doesn't see the oil cost in it's impact on fertilizer cost, or food prices in poor countries, or something similar, so he makes what is for him the right Local decision, but Globally, it is the wrong one.Of course bringing oil into it pulls Jared Diamond to mind. Only soil, Diamond's favorite limited resource, could be more apt. Here's a link to some comparison between this book and Diamond's Collapse.About a year later, a gloomy note  from Thomas Edsall of NYT opining that America's had her run, and will be next. Hope he's wrong.And later still, the latest foodie trend here in Boulder is to disparage the humble wheat stalk, it's multifarious chromosome threatening our digestion. What if this graduates from trend to generally accepted fact? What if the ideal response is to regress to einkorn and yields drop by half? Just in case society does collapse, I'll document the fall here, so at least at the end I can say ""I told ya so!"" (I expect there's a great business in Cassandrasim, but the rewards are fleeting.)"

Some of the dialogue here is strikingly similar and the rational and overwhelmed central female protagonist, Lenore Beadsman, struggling through a world of neurotic men in Wallace's novel seems heavily based on Cleo Birdwell and her many suitors.This is an excellent book, laugh-out-loud funny, and the best of the five or six DeLillo novels I've read.

This is one of a few books that have Laura's articles she wrote for the Missouri Realist in it. The way she writes is fitting for today as it was during her lifetime. Here is quote from one of her articles that I liked: ""While blue is without a doubt a heavenly color, it is better in skies than in one's mind ..."" Very fitting. I also found this very fitting as how to make your life more simple seems to be the theme in a lot of books and magazines. In January 1924 Laura wrote an article about how to simplifying your life. I thought we could all go by her advice. She said ""Here is a good New Year's resolution for us all to make: To simplify our lives as much as possible, to overcome that feeling of haste by remembering that there are just as many hours in the day as ever, and that there is time enough for the things that matter if time is rightly used.""

8181,Question of Proof,Joseph Amiel,3.68,79,9,Jo Reason,3,"It is not all that past faced but it is a good solid read. Plenty of greed, sex, old money and family secrets. A classic who dunnut murder mystery and you can´t beat those. It took a while to get into, there are loads of characters that I found confusing at first. I really needed to concentrate at the beginning of the book, so make sure you can get some time out or you will need to re-read pages. And as the chapters are rather long you might find it difficult to get into. But get over that little hiccup and you have a good solid read. Not as much court room drama as I thought and a rather interesting love story in it also that the author spent plenty of time on elaborating. This book was originally published in 1993, but has since been republished, it hasn´t outdated. I am not sure if the cover is the original or new for this edition, but it seems a little antiquated and could be better. This is a good court room drama but it takes a long time getting there covering the background of the main characters and the lead up to the trial takes up the majority of the book and if you are looking for a longer court room drama this might not be the books for you. Although having said this the ending is spectacular, I never saw it coming and I loved it. Dan was a good character, with a past that seems to be more and more common, an ex-wife and son living the other side of the country. He was my favourite character of the lot. And by far my favourite part was the trial. Highly recommended for those lovers of courtroom dramas, with a little extra twist in the tale. 3 ½ stars out of five.At the page 314 of the epub edition (not sure if this is the correct location though) there is a mistake. Close to the end of the page it says:His first guess was correct: to entertain Jamie, Susan and Ron were staying at Circus Circus. It should say Hannah and Ron."
8179,Judah's Sceptre and Joseph's Birthright,J.H.   Allen,4.15,20,3,Washicd,5,"For those who might liken the Bible (especially the Old Testament) to a very large puzzle without an accompanying reference picture, this book greatly simplifies the putting of the pieces in objectively proper order with it's Biblical referencing and documentation generously applied (and in proper context). I highly suggest this book, but only after you've read the Bible. Otherwise you may be tempted to relegate it as fiction or the unsubstantiated musings of a well meaning but overreaching searcher. I have to admit that the style of writing is from a bygone generation which makes it a bit of a difficult read but well worth the difficulty for the understanding that it contains. Allen's ability to tie together the glaring loose ends that modern Biblical understanding leaves unattended is immensely re-enforcing. Also, this is not the 'self help / life coaching' sort of spiritual jambalaya that fills the book shelves of today's Christian book shops. Want to understand the Bible?, this is a good start to a firm foundation.While Allen winds up giving a persuasive argument for a sort of British Israelism, I tend to see more toward a 'Christian Israelism' where the gentiles are adopted in. Of the several modern day disciples/teachers that God has led my direction, Allen sits atop the list with few others."
8201,"The Early Years Collection (Little House, #1, 3-6)",Laura Ingalls Wilder,4.34,372,12,Heidi,5,"Couldn't find the exact version, but we read a hardcover version with the first 3 books of Little House on the Prairie. These were our ""naptime/quiet time"" books that I would read every afternoon wit the girls. They really loved this series. And the fact that these were true stories made them all the more intriguing for us. We love Laura and all her adventures. The only thing I was a little surprised at was that she didn't talk a whole lot about how their faith brought them through their trials. I suppose it's because she saw all this as a little girl. I think we'll read a few more of the series when the girls are a couple years older. I think we'll look at a fantasy/ficion series again. Any suggestions?"
8183,Birthright,Joseph Amiel,3.97,62,6,Amanda,5,"Reasons I decided to read this book:1) I was bored2) It was the only book my mother owned that wasn't either a cookbook or how to knit a doily kind of book.3) It didn't look like she was taking me to the library anytime soon, so I had to settle.The category it fills on my bingo board is: a book that has been made into a movie and it could also fall under A book with a main female character.What I hate about seeing a movie that has created from a beloved read of mine, is that nothing is quite right. It might be the way that the casting is all wrong (for the last damn time! Annabeth's hair is blonde not bloody red! All children of Athena mut have BLONDE hair! Seriously! Why is this so hard for the caster person to understand?). It might be that they do not move or sound at all the way you pictured or heard them in your head. (Why do you sound like a grizzly bear, Captain Haddock?). And sometimes the offense is serious, like when the scene from the perfect book has been taken and destroyed mercilessly at the hands of the director. (Dude! Voldemort died like a regular man! He fell to the floor with a mundane finality! It was important! Why the hell did he turn into butterflied in the movie??).This was the terrible misfortune that befell Birthright. The stupid director changed many of the main ideas of the book, till it was no longer the brutal, touching story of a strong ambitious girl, who finds herself orphaned even amongst her adoptive family and takes her future into her own hands till she succeeds in building herself a bright future, but the silly traipsing of a flirt who wins by stealing men's hearts.My favourite character was definitely Deborah De Kronengold. She was such a strong, beautiful character that every reader could not help but to feel a connection with her. We were also given the opportunity to watch Deborah's personality grow and change over the years. In the beginning we met and fell in love with the bright, playful girl of around 7, who is witty and extremely cheeky, and has not yet discovered her true heritage. At this stage in the novel, Deborah is carefree and happy, not a worry on her mind. We cry with her as her adoptive father recklessly lets slip she is adopted and for the first time a seed of sadness and doubt is planted in her heart and watch as her personality becomes more serious and insecure. Why did her parents not want her? Was she not good enough? We delight as she grows to be stronger, bearing the hardships along the way and working hard and fighting for everything she believes in. What I so admire about Deborah, is that in the time this book was written, women were just starting to work and they had certainly never owned their own business, and Deborah will not give up till she manages to fulfil her dream.My favourite quote is ""You adopted me, but you never truly accepted me as your own and for that, Leslie De Kronengold, you deserve every bit of misfortune about to befall you."" Yes, I loved this quote. It really touched me because as a reader I was really beginning to feel a lot of personal hatred towards the fictional Mr. Kronengold, who as Deborah said, adopted but never accepted her. It really struck me that when Deborah said this, it was the voice of the vulnerable child who had been in desperate need of love or simply acceptance from her ""father"" and was instead given hatred and abuse, who spoke.Something I learnt, or rather that I was reminded of was that, the future really is up to you. When times seem bleakest, fight because you know that you're not going to achieve anything by just sitting there and moping. Hey Ms Berry! Hope you're not too tired from marking our reviews! Good Luck!"

8540,Blood Sport,Dick Francis,3.86,4515,121,James Thane,3,"Gene Hawkins is an English civil servant--actually a very astute investigator for a department that is never named. He's also severely depressed following the end of a love affair and is toying with the idea of suicide. He has a three-week vacation coming, and this is probably not good news for a man who has no life outside of his work and who is thinking of ending his own life.Just as his vacation begins though, Hawkins's boss asks him to accompany him and his family on a Sunday afternoon boating outing. This is very odd, since the boss has never before asked Hawkins to socialize outside of work. The boss's precocious young daughter picks Hawkins up and drives him to the boat. They cast off and the boss introduces Gene to the rest of his family and to his other guest, a man named Dave Teller.Obviously, there's an ulterior motive lurking behind the invitation, and it turns out that Teller is part of a syndicate that has just lost a very expensive horse in the United States. This is the third such horse that has gone missing, the boss wonders if Hawkins would mind using his vacation to go to the U.S. and investigate the matter as a favor to Teller. Hawkins has no interest in undertaking such a mission and turns the offer down. But then, while the party is still on the river, an incident occurs that convinces Hawkins to change his mind. Before long he's on his way to the U.S. and begins tracking the latest missing horse. Obviously, this is going to be a very dangerous mission, But his adversaries have no idea that Hawkins is already contemplating ending his own life, so what does he have to lose?This book is a bit unusual for a Dick Francis novel in that most of it takes place in the U.S., rather than the U.K. And, while there are horses involved, the main protagonist is not actually part of the racing world. It's a fun, quick read, but maybe not quite on a par with a lot of other Dick Francis books. Hawkins is an OK protagonist, but one of the things that usually characterizes a Dick Francis novel is an especially menacing bad guy who's controlling things from behind the scenes. The villains here are not as scary as usual, but that's a relatively small complaint and fans of Dick Francis should certainly enjoy this effort."
8539,Whip Hand ,Dick Francis,4.06,4898,142,Algernon,5," Winning was all. Winning was my function. What I was there for. What I wanted. What I was born for.In the dream, I won the race. The shouting turned to cheering, and the cheering lifted me up on its wings, like a wave. But the winning was all; not the cheering. I woke in the dark, as I often did, at four in the morning.There was silence. No cheering, just silence.I could still feel the way I moved with the horse, the ripple of muscle through both of the striving bodies, uniting in one. I could still feel the irons round my feet, the calves of my legs gripping, the balance, the nearness to my head of the stretching brown neck, the mane blowing in my mouth, my hands on the reins.There came, at that point, the second awakening. The real one. The moment in which I first moved and opened my eyes, and remembered that I wouldn’t ride any more races, ever. Sid Halley is the quintessential Francis hero. It is no surprise for me that in a long list of stand-alone novels, he is the only one to be given a second and third chance in the limelight. He is probably the closest the author has come to talk about himself, about the former top steeplechase jockey whose whole life turned around the racing track, who was forced to give up the love of his life and start a new career. And who brought to this new career all the will to get to the top, all the dedication and the professionalism that defined him on the back of a horse.This particular novel has an additional personal appeal to me, as it is the very first thriller by Dick Francis that I ever read, back in the early 1990’s. Twenty five years later, I am still one of the faithfull fans of the author.Sid Halley has been forced out of his chosen profession by a horrible accident that mauled his ‘whip hand’. In his first novel (Odds Against), he is trying to deal with the trauma, and to find a new purpose in life by joining a private investigation agency focusing on the racing world. In the beginning of this second novel, Sid is still investigating crooks and liars around the racetrack, is self-employed, and rather too well appreciated for his success. This fame and his rate of success translates in the bad guys trying to drive him out by threats and physical violence.As you can see from my opening quote, the thriller is written in the first person narrative, and a liking for the protagonist is key to the enjoyment of the ride. When I try to picture Sid in my mind, I’m thinking of one of those ‘tall-in-the-saddle’ cowboy heroes of the 50’s, like Jimmy Stewart, Gary Cooper or Gregory Peck. The quiet types, unassuming, soft spoken and serious, but unbending and relentless in the pursuit of justice. Sid may be viewed as bad news by the rascals he chases, but in his own mind he is daily battling with feelings of inadequacy, with loneliness and regrets over his broken marriage, with the empty places left in his life after he was exiled from the racetrack-	When you look at me, what do you see?-	You know what I see.-	Do you see a lot of fears and self doubts, and feelings of shame and uselessness and inadequacy?-	Of course not, you never show feelings like that.-	No one does. Everyone has an outside and an inside, and the two can be quite different. [...] To myself, I’m a jumble of uncertainty and fear and stupidity.I believe Sid is saved by this very insecurity, which pushes him to try harder and to fight back. I also admire his stoicism, his sense of humour, and his curiosity about the world and the people he meets. In a cynical world that eyes only profit and where the end justifies the evil means used to achieve it, Sid is a breath of fresh air and hope in the chance of the underdog to bring down the fat cats of business.I will not go into details about the plot, it is good and clever but not exceptional. Three separate lines of investigation weave in and out of focus: the mysterious death of champion colts, an internal investigation of corruption at the top level of the Jockey Club and a private request from Sid’s former wife to unmask a confidence trickster. The obligatory scenes of brutality and physical injury are starting to annoy me a bit, after encountering them in every single novel by Francis that I read, but they serve their purpose in the plot and in separating the bad guys from the good guys.In conclusion, my rating is a subjective (rabid fan) one, but I would recommend the first two Sid Halley novels as a great ‘entry drug’ for readers as yet unfamiliar with the books of Dick Francis."

2122,The Fountainhead,Ayn Rand,3.85,257320,10311,Jason Pettus,3,"Would you like to hear the only joke I've ever written? Q: ""How many Objectivists does it take to screw in a lightbulb?"" A: (Pause, then disdainfully) ""Uh...one!"" And thus it is that so many of us have such a complicated relationship with the work of Ayn Rand; unabashed admirers at the age of 19, unabashedly horrified by 25, after hanging out with some actual Objectivists and witnessing what a--holes they actually are, and also realizing that Rand and her cronies were one of the guiltiest parties when it came to the 1950s ""Red Scare"" here in America. Here in Rand's first massive manifesto-slash-novel, we meet the theoretically ultimate Objectivist -- architect Howard Roarke, who is so just completely sure of what he should be doing with his constructions, he won't even participate in his industry at all unless his client gives him complete and utter control over the final project; which is why Howard Roarke barely ever completes any projects over the course of his life, which according to Rand is because of the vast unwashed masses of the insipid keeping the obvious genius down. Righteous, Ayn, righteous! Ultimately it's easy to see in novels like this one why Rand is so perfect for late teenagers, but why she elicits eye rolls by one's mid-twenties; because Objectivism is all about BEING RIGHT, and DROPPING OUT IF OTHERS CAN'T UNDERSTAND THAT, and LET 'EM ALL GO TO HELL AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, without ever taking into account the unending amount of compromise and cooperation and sometimes sheer altruism that actually makes the world work.

8551,Flying Finish,Dick Francis,3.92,2551,89,James Thane,3,"In this Dick Francis novel the protagonist is an amateur jockey. However, unlike most of Francis's novels, our hero spends very little time on horseback, and racing constitutes a very minor part of the story. Henry Grey is heir to a British title but would prefer not to be. The last child and the only son in his family, he was largely ignored as a child and developed into something of a loner with few social skills. He's happiest when he's piloting a small rented plane on his days off, alone in the skies over Britain.Like many of Britain's noble families, Henry's has fallen on hard times financially. The massive family home is ancient and falling into disrepair. His parents and elder sisters expect Henry to do the right thing and marry some wealthy heiress who will bail out the family, but Henry wants no part of it and constantly avoids the young women that his mother keeps throwing at him.He works in an office that arranges for the transportation of racing horses to countries near and far, but he's bored with that and so takes a job on the planes that actually fly the horses from one destination to another. The man who owns the company humors Henry by giving him the job, but he's sure that the titled nobleman won't stick it out for very long.Obviously, though, the employer has never read a Dick Francis novel and doesn't know the kind of man he's really dealing with here. Like most Francis protagonists, Henry Grey is a quiet but very intelligent and capable man. He's also very determined and once he sets his mind to something, it's virtually impossible to change his course. Before long, Henry will discover that something very odd is going on in the horse transport business, and his discovery could well cost him his life.Like most Dick Francis novels, this one is well-plotted and moves along at a brisk pace. The climax is riveting and if I have any reservations it's only because Henry Grey is not quite as interesting as the protagonists in most of the other books. Still, I enjoyed the book, and I'm sure that most Dick Francis fans will as well."
8550,Risk,Dick Francis,3.92,2621,80,Algernon,4,"Risk is one of the better titles in the Dick Francis catalogue, one that I recommend to readers as yet unfamiliar with his opus as a showcase of his abilities as a storyteller. As usual, it is told in first person by a likable character that looses no time in getting under the reader's skin and gaining his sympathy. How's this for an opening line: Thursday, March 17, I spent the morning in anxiety, the afternoon in extasy and the evening unconscious. Read on to find out how the fortunes of Roland Britten, up-and-coming young accountant and amateur steeplechase jockey, rise and fall from one moment to another, with the regularity of a  montagne-russe  ride. A rather lengthy opening sequence describes Roland's attempts to escape from being kidnapped for unknown reasons. The time is well spent for getting acquainted with his level headed approach to problem solving, his ingenuity and his stoical acceptance of things out of his control (  When things go bad, you endure what you must, and thank God it's not worse. ). Back in England (come on, you knew he would escape, Francis is not George R R Martin to snuff out his main character in the middle of the story!), Roland tries to put back the pieces of his life and return to the routine of balancing accounts, auditing tax declarations and sneaking off to ride in another weekend race. With the usual thorough research, Francis makes the rather boring activity of adding up columns of numbers into a glamorous and dangerous pastime. The mysterious bad guys are not finished with Roland and the plot thickens with the introduction of a trio of ex-convicts as potential suspects (sent down by Roland himself for fraud) plus assorted trainers, horse owners, bookmakers and racegoers. Complications of a romantic nature with a rather ripe and plain school mistress ( I wonder though what kind of school the author went to?) competing for Roland affections with the young and lively daughter of one of his clients.I have read so many of Dick Francis thrillers that I am now able to spot the bad guy from his first or second appearance on the scene. With Risk, I am discovering it doesn't do to become overconfident, as the author is still capable of pulling a fast one on me ((view spoiler)[ I was right about his boss being crooked, but didn't see the mastermind that organized the kidnapping, and also didn't cotton on to the fact a whole coterie of baddies might be involved, as in Agatha Christie's classic Orient Express murder  (hide spoiler)]). The finale is typical Francis, brains and resilience (  Endurance is like tax. You're silly to pay more than you have to, but you can't always escape it. And you can whine, or suffer with good grace. ) versus violent ruthlessness and greed, leaving me with a feelgood smile pasted on my face and a little more hope in my fellow humans. In the introduction, critic H. R.F. Keating says Francis scores equally with professors of logic reading in the train from Oxford and children reading under the desk at school. I find myself in agreement with him, and look forward to keep reading these books as I get older."

4583,Everything Is Illuminated,Jonathan Safran Foer,3.9,145508,7096,Kim,5,"Sometimes reading makes me so angryDammit.I’m a freaking mess. I realize this and I accept it.Ugh.Why, Jonathan Safran Foer? Why? Why do you do this to me? And why the hell are you so young? I know that some call you gimmicky and think that you are just a phosphoresce in the pannikin (yes, I, too, have access to Thesaurus.com) but I just…just…spleen them. They can read their Anderson and their Coetzee and leave us dreamers alone. I am ‘Team Foer’; others be damned. (I still wish you weren’t so freaking young, though)The story is fragmented, told through letters and hodgepodges of writings that might or might not be parts of a novel. There is the story about the people of Trachimbrod, which might be Trochenbrod, a city in western Ukraine that was decimated during WWII by a Nazi Invasion. There is the story of Alex and Jonathan and their journey to find out Who is Augustine?  And to thank her for saving Jonathan’s lineage. There is the story of Grandfather and Herschel (copious amounts of tears during that one). And then there are the stories within the stories. The story of Brod, Jonathan’s great great great great great grandmother and her struggle with loving the idea of love and her 613 sadnesses ( “Mirror Sadness”, “Sadness of not knowing if your body is normal”, “Beauty Sadness”, “Sadness of Hands”, “Sadness of knowing that your body is normal”, “Kissing Sadness”, “Sadness of wanting sadness”, “Sadness of feeling the need to create beautiful things”, What if? Sadness”, “Sadness”, “Secret Sadness.”) The story of the would-be ‘Augustine’ and her house with its many labeled boxes ( ‘Silver/Perfume/Pinwheels’, ‘Watches/Winter’, ‘Darkness’, ‘Pillowcases’, ‘Poetry/Nails/Pisces’, ‘Dust’, 'Menorahs/Inks/Keys', 'Death of a Firstborn', 'In Case')I loved them all. I love the awakenings and the not-truths. I love the humor and the tragedies and the friendships. I am giddy and heavy hearted. I am in love with the idea. What I loved most, what I clung to after I finished the book, was this:Jews have Six SensesTouch, taste, sight, smell, hearing….memory. While Gentiles experience and process the world through the traditional senses, and see memory only as a second-order means of interpreting events, for Jews memory is no less primary than the prick of a pin, or its silver glimmer, or the taste of the blood it pulls from the finger. The Jew is pricked by a pin and remembers other pins. It is only by tracing the pinprick back to other pinpricks—when his mother tried to fix his sleeve while his arm was still in it, when his grandfather’s fingers fell from stroking his great-grandfather’s damp forehead, when Abraham tested the knife point to be sure Isaac would feel no pain---that the Jew is able to know why it hurts. When a Jew encounters a pin, he asks “What does it remember like?”The idea of memory as a sense. Okay, I’ve admitted it before and will again and again. I’m a shiksa—a French-Canadian/German/NH bred—Shiksa. I can’t fathom the horrors of having the Holocaust in my past, I won’t even begin to pretend to imagine the ramifications. But I can appreciate this idea:  “What does it remember like?” Aren’t we all tied to the past? Aren’t all of our future actions predetermined by a memory?  “Everything is the way it is because everything was the way it was.”So much for Free Will. At one point, Alex begs Jonathan when writing their story:  “I beseech you to forgive us, and to make us better than we are. Make us good.”We have that power in writing.

4584,Everything Is Illuminated,Jonathan Safran Foer,3.9,145510,7096,Kim,5,"Sometimes reading makes me so angryDammit.I’m a freaking mess. I realize this and I accept it.Ugh.Why, Jonathan Safran Foer? Why? Why do you do this to me? And why the hell are you so young? I know that some call you gimmicky and think that you are just a phosphoresce in the pannikin (yes, I, too, have access to Thesaurus.com) but I just…just…spleen them. They can read their Anderson and their Coetzee and leave us dreamers alone. I am ‘Team Foer’; others be damned. (I still wish you weren’t so freaking young, though)The story is fragmented, told through letters and hodgepodges of writings that might or might not be parts of a novel. There is the story about the people of Trachimbrod, which might be Trochenbrod, a city in western Ukraine that was decimated during WWII by a Nazi Invasion. There is the story of Alex and Jonathan and their journey to find out Who is Augustine?  And to thank her for saving Jonathan’s lineage. There is the story of Grandfather and Herschel (copious amounts of tears during that one). And then there are the stories within the stories. The story of Brod, Jonathan’s great great great great great grandmother and her struggle with loving the idea of love and her 613 sadnesses ( “Mirror Sadness”, “Sadness of not knowing if your body is normal”, “Beauty Sadness”, “Sadness of Hands”, “Sadness of knowing that your body is normal”, “Kissing Sadness”, “Sadness of wanting sadness”, “Sadness of feeling the need to create beautiful things”, What if? Sadness”, “Sadness”, “Secret Sadness.”) The story of the would-be ‘Augustine’ and her house with its many labeled boxes ( ‘Silver/Perfume/Pinwheels’, ‘Watches/Winter’, ‘Darkness’, ‘Pillowcases’, ‘Poetry/Nails/Pisces’, ‘Dust’, 'Menorahs/Inks/Keys', 'Death of a Firstborn', 'In Case')I loved them all. I love the awakenings and the not-truths. I love the humor and the tragedies and the friendships. I am giddy and heavy hearted. I am in love with the idea. What I loved most, what I clung to after I finished the book, was this:Jews have Six SensesTouch, taste, sight, smell, hearing….memory. While Gentiles experience and process the world through the traditional senses, and see memory only as a second-order means of interpreting events, for Jews memory is no less primary than the prick of a pin, or its silver glimmer, or the taste of the blood it pulls from the finger. The Jew is pricked by a pin and remembers other pins. It is only by tracing the pinprick back to other pinpricks—when his mother tried to fix his sleeve while his arm was still in it, when his grandfather’s fingers fell from stroking his great-grandfather’s damp forehead, when Abraham tested the knife point to be sure Isaac would feel no pain---that the Jew is able to know why it hurts. When a Jew encounters a pin, he asks “What does it remember like?”The idea of memory as a sense. Okay, I’ve admitted it before and will again and again. I’m a shiksa—a French-Canadian/German/NH bred—Shiksa. I can’t fathom the horrors of having the Holocaust in my past, I won’t even begin to pretend to imagine the ramifications. But I can appreciate this idea:  “What does it remember like?” Aren’t we all tied to the past? Aren’t all of our future actions predetermined by a memory?  “Everything is the way it is because everything was the way it was.”So much for Free Will. At one point, Alex begs Jonathan when writing their story:  “I beseech you to forgive us, and to make us better than we are. Make us good.”We have that power in writing. To take away the bad and to recreate. We usually choose not to. It has to be gritty…fairytales are for the young…we need to set the story straight… we need to exorcise our demons….and so on. Make us good. God, that just about killed me.And this is why I will always defend Foer. His ability to bring me to this awareness and to break my heart in 300 pages or less. "
4578,Journey Between Worlds,Sylvia Engdahl,3.59,138,19,Rhode,3,"I got a copy of the 2006 hardcover edition with an absolutely crazy-sauce, cartoony cover that I adore. It's worth the cost of the book alone. It does not represent the book's contents though which are far more classic.In her Afterward to this edition, the author notes she was surprised that aside from a few scientific updates the biggest changes that she had to edit for when updating her 1970 original for this edition were the consequences of late 20th century feminism. As she puts it, ""modern women's outlook toward marriage and toward careers...have changed more than my views of space have.""Despite her updates, the book's relationships feel slightly old fashioned. The heroine unthinkingly lets her boyfriend push her around, her career dream is to be a teacher and the only other teacher we meet is also female, plus it's assumed that a man doing business in a foreign place must need a wife, or wife substitute, to serve as a 'hostess' at his side. That said, I shudder to think what the 1970 version must have had going on...and am somewhat fascinated to realize that those 1970s edition attitudes were what I lived through as a little girl. I don't think young women today have any grasp on how huge a revolution occurred in the generation just before them.Those musings aside, this is a sweet book. It's truly a coming of age, new adult thing. The heroine on occasion is so dumb about her attitudes that you want to shake her. But I'm willing to give it a pass because all that can be new adult in reality.The descriptions of life on Mars colony are very well done indeed. And it's exceptionally pleasant to read a science fiction novel where it's not a huge space opera, nobody has to save the world, the aliens are not coming, and the revolution is not nigh. It's ordinary life instead. Real, true feeling ordinary life."
4577,Century of War,F. William Engdahl,4.22,276,19,Chris,4,"You won’t know what to believe anymore after reading this book. It’s an insane but compelling economic history of the exploitation of the world under the guise of national strategy. It’s a treasure chest for the conspiracy theorist. Perhaps it should be subtitled: “And that’s why they hate us.” Engdahl has some far fetched accusations as he strings his economic history of the exploitation of oil by the Anglo-Americans. He indulges in guilt by association but he connects the dots in a compelling manner. This is in the style of Howard Zinn as an expose that makes you feel ashamed to have a government like ours. If the Tea Party is trying to take the country back, well I’ve got news for them, we the people have never had the country, period. And if you’re trying to buy this book, good luck finding it. That sort of proves Engdahl’s point too, I guess."
7460,Security Analysis: The Classic 1940 Edition,Benjamin Graham,4.32,5064,91,Phillip,5,"The 6th edition (which is the 75th anniversary of the 1st edition) has an absolutely wonderful and very heartfelt introduction by Buffett. This is actually a reprint of the 2nd edition but annotated by revered investors/academics, which I enjoyed. I have to warn this is basically a textbook and will come across as very dry. The first few times I read Graham I thought it was very dry but I've acclimated myself to him and now enjoy his writing. Graham is always very careful never to inject any flamboyance in his writings. He is, I believe, at heart a teacher (he taught at Columbia and UCLA for more than 30 years cumatively) but he was also a brilliant money manager. He invented the first hedge fund in the 20's (but doesn't get credit for it). Graham's style is like a scientist, if there is any doubt for a method, he will readily illuminate it for the reader. He is very understated so as not to ever elevate expectations for the student/investor. Getting back to the teacher, he wanted everyone to be able to apply his writings so the book is very quantitative (not heavy in math, just statements that can be delimited). I recommend Fisher for the qualitative. Graham addresses the qualitative in other writings, but the reader will probably pick up he is uncomfortable and/or apathetic with it and limits it as much as possible.This is 5 stars not simply for the comprehensiveness but the originality. There is a time-period bias for the modern reader. Graham literally invented most of the methods and ideas in the book. He is a modern day Newton whereby he had to invent calculus to explain gravity, Graham invented fundamental investing and provided, if I can borrow from Sagan, a candle in the dark to illuminate the irrationality, ok I paraphrased from Sagan."

1801,Reading Greek Tragedy,Simon Goldhill,4,25,2,Michael Hattem,5,"If you are someone who has read Greek tragedy on your own and enjoyed it, then this book may be for you. It is almost impossible for someone without a solid grounding in Greek culture, history, mythology, and philosophy to fully grasp the tragedies. Goldhill's literary criticism of the tragedies is revelatory. He opens up the tragedies to reveal layer upon layer of subtext. His discussion of the use of language in The Oresteia is near-breathtaking and this book will make one see the masterworks of Greek tragedy in a completely different light."
1802,The Poet's Voice: Essays on Poetics and Greek Literature,Simon Goldhill,4,5,1,Caracalla,4,"The early chapters on Homer are highly derivative, the Theocritus chapter is almost unreadable at times but he provides a necessary corrective to didactic readings of Aristophanes. The Pindar chapter is possibly derivative but seems to be presciently close to modern consensus otherwise. Goldhill's unsure about his deconstructionism here for some reason, maybe because his earlier attempts just emphasized textual uncertainty and lacked critical edge; certainly the Pindar reading lacks radicalism. Valuable for me, taught me a lot particularly on unfamiliar Hellenistic poetry."
1797,Pindar's Homer: The Lyric Possession of An Epic Past,Gregory Nagy,4.67,9,2,Bryant,4,"My reading focused on the four chapters in which Nagy treats the stirring (and heretofore unexplored) correspondences between the lyric poetry of Pindar and the ancient world's first great prose achievement, the Histories of Herodotus. Nagy's chapters remain the fundamental study for four aspects of interrelation: the ways in which both writers talk about their own work, the narrators' techniques of establishing authority, the representations of tyranny in both genres, and the convergent purposes of lyric and historiography. John Marincola has pointed out (in the opening chapter of the Cambridge Companion to Herodotus) that more work awaits those who wish to tease out the connections between lyric poetry and Herodotus' project. Nagy's chapters are the essential launchpad for all such studies."
1800,"Love, Sex  Tragedy: How the Ancient World Shapes Our Lives",Simon Goldhill,3.75,145,17,Terence,3,"What I liked about Simon Goldhill’s Love, Sex & Tragedy was that he (mostly) avoids sounding like a curmudgeonly stick-in-the-mud who can’t handle the loss of the classical curriculum in education and the knowledge of Western civilization’s origins. He laments it not because he wants to hear people quoting Homer from memory (in the original Greek) or see glowing comparisons of politicians to Cincinnatus but because he sees little evidence that what’s replaced it is tackling the same issues in as deep a manner. He doesn’t see any counterparts today to Homer, Herodotus and Thucydides, or to Sophocles and Euripides, among others. And this dumbing down of our public discourse infects all aspects of culture – politics, entertainment, social relationships, literature, the arts, etc.Why study the classics?I’m going to be lazy and simply quote the author from the last pages of the book, where he concludes:For thinking hard about the past reveals the buried life of the present, its potential for change, for being different. Looking back critically at where we come from is a revelatory education about the present.The simplest point that emerges from looking back at how the myths of Greece and Rome have functioned in the history of European culture is this: the past matters. It matters because in psychological, social, intellectual, artistic and political terms the past is formative of the present. It is the person’s or culture’s deep grounding. It matters how the past is understood or told. Stories change lives. They make foundations, they build hopes and they can kill. A self-aware appreciation of the past requires reflecting on the myths and the histories, the story-telling and the critical analysis, which makes sense of the past – and thus the present....Understanding the past also requires that we understand how previous generations thought of the past, were stimulated and inspired by it, rebelled against it, denied it. Classical antiquity has constantly been reinvented as the privileged model of the past, and it has been thus a force for comprehending – and changing – the present....If we do not recognize how classical antiquity furnished the imagination, stimulated and structured thought and acted as a banner of artistic and political revolution, our view of our own cultural tradition will be necessarily distorted. (pp. 319-20)Aside from the general conclusion above, I found several of the specifics the author focuses on interesting. One in particular stood out because of personal interests, and I’ll mention it here so you can get an idea of the issues Goldhill deals with. He spends a great deal of time (two chapters – 26 pages) discussing the Oedipus myth (as transmitted by Sophocles; there were other versions) and how it became and remains a profound analysis of the human condition, helped by Freud making it the basis for his psychology.Oedipus is the archetypal hero figure trying to discover where he comes from: “Oedipus’ search for himself, his journey to discover where he comes from, is the paradigmatic example of how we must look back for self-knowledge, but also of how disturbing and painful that necessary process can be” (p. 298) and “Most shocking is the play’s insistent and disturbing claim that is it exactly at the moment you think you know where you come from and who you are that you are most open to a tragedy of self-deception” (p. 306). Goldhill sees Oedipus as particularly important in the 21st century when Western civilization struggles ever more desperately to know and to control but only seems to discover ever more uncertainty and ever less control.I would recommend the book. Even if you don’t agree with the author’s conclusions in parts of the book, it’s still an interesting look at the influence Greece and Rome had and continues to have over our lives."

Jest to zasadniczo pierwsza książka o CSS, jaką przeczytałem, dlatego też trochę trudno ocenić mi jej jakość, porównując ją do czegokolwiek innego. Oprawa graficzna mogłaby być ciut lepsza. No i książka pomimo wielu aktualizacji ma już swoje lata, czego trudno nie zauważyć.This is a really nice references book about the CSS where we can find a lot of key information that are good to know at the beginning.

7251,The Poisonwood Bible,Barbara Kingsolver,4.03,566829,20123,Ebookwormy1,1,"On one hand, there is nothing new here, and on this same old tirade, I disagree strongly with the author. Examples:* Relativism. I'm sorry, I believe infanticide to be wrong for all cultures, for all times.* Missionaries, particularly protestant missionaries to Africa were entirely the endeavor of egotistic, abusive, colonialists who were merely out to change Africa into either a western society or an exploitative factory for western society. Wrong again, read Tom Hiney's ""On the Missionary Trail"" for a non-fiction perspective that documents ways in which many missionaries were actually upsetting the colonial balance by preparing native peoples for independence, tutoring leaders on negotiation with world powers, recording native history and cultural practices and transcribing their languages, ; see also Philips Jenkins' ""The Next Christendom"".* Marriage is an oppressive institution that consumes women; they need to escape. Certainly SOME marriages are, but that doesn't mean we go the way of disregarding it as a foundational institution of society. * America is an evil power of which we should all be ashamed. False again. I cannot deny mistakes have been made in American foreign policy, and certainly events of the Congo, as presented in this book, would appear to be this way. But, there are also many things America has done that are good (such as preserving freedom for those who live here to write books ripping on America), and these shouldn't be ignored.* All cultural traditions should be preserved because they have merit in and of themselves. I do not agree with this at all. Female circumcision should not be, regardless of whether it is a cultural tradition. Not only does it serve no purpose to enhance the lives of either men or women, it is destructive to them. At the same time, the American high-fat, high-sugar diet, while traditional (burgers, fries and shakes) should be changed. American isolationalism that doesn't consider other cultures and peoples should also go too.* The work is hailed as an ""examination of personal responsibility"". Clearly all Belgians, American, colonialists, businessmen, husbands/fathers, missionaries, and mothers (to a lesser extent) are to be found culpable in the downfall of the Congo, as if this type of situation has never occurred in history before. But the truth is often far more complex, and the events in Congo, while horrible, cannot really be understood outside of their larger context. Was Congo the only African nation to suffer? Was there truly not a single benefit of colonialism? Were all businessmen/ westerners culpable or colluding? Were all involved in the downfall of the Congo Christians? Were not the African leader, Mbuto (funded by the US, yes) and his followers not equally guilty of selling out Africans for personal gain? Were there not some westerners (like the noble parents of the author mentioned in the prelude) trying to make life better for Africans? Is this not the same thing we see currently in Zimbabwe? If we are going to examine evil and exploitation, let's remember that no one person, country, or even time, has a lock on it. And lets not paint extreme pictures of those we chose to reject, while painting those we agree with in glowing terms. As with many fictional accounts, we don't like to admit the good and the bad falls on both sides.*Christianity is merely a tool people use to exploit others and promote their own agenda. I fundamentally disagree with this perspective. Christianity is a relationship with Christ that involves following after Him and becoming more like Him.The extreme situation the author creates in this fictional account allows her to proclaim her philosophies of life with vigor, particularly anti-Christianity and anti-Americanism. In the foreword, she makes effort to point out that her parents (who went to the Congo in the same time period) have NOTHING in common with the main subjects of the work, essentially preparing the reader for the assault upon the southern baptist missionary and his 4 children from Georgia who are the main characters.With such flaws, a work should be easily dismissed. However, there are some glowing strong points. The writing is exceptional, and there are many rich scenes that are not soon forgotten. The understanding of African life, customs, language and landscape as well as the ability to portray this amazingly beautiful land as a living organism were compellingly impressed upon my mind. The character development and interaction of perspectives (each chapter is the perspective of one character, the book being a series of their interwoven stories), is extraordinary; though it is noteworthy that the author doesn't include a single chapter from the perspective of the husband/father/missionary zealot of the family, but only permits him to be defined by the others. I really cared about the characters and wanted to know what would happen to them.The examination of cross-cultural interaction and communication is powerfully illustrated as we begin with a purely American perspective that slowly opens (through the eyes of some, not all, characters) to an African perspective.While it might be a helpful work to those longing to know Africa or understand cross-cultural disconnects, I cannot give it more than two stars because of the blatant agenda referenced above.ADDENDUM: For those really wanting to understand the history of the Congo, including the dark side of it's formation, I recommend ""King Leopold's Ghost"" by Adam Hochschild. Hochschild's work is well told, enjoyable even to non-historians, and will give an excellent picture of the dynamics (both the good and the evil) at work in the Congo. Looking back, compared to the exceptional ""King Leopold's Ghost"", Poisonwood Bible was an incredible waste of time - i'm lowering it to one star.Tom Hiney's ""On the Missionary Trail"" is also excellent in content, though not as well written, for those interested in the lives of ordinary (meaning not generally famous) missionaries around the world.King Leopold's Ghost, Hochschild, 1999https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...On the Missionary Trail, Hiney, 2001https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...Give Me this Mountain, Roseveare, 1966https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...This is a non-fiction memoir written by a missionary serving in the Congo during the time period covered by Kingsolver. You will notice the prose lacks Kingsolver's enchantment, but you will learn something of what it was actually like for a mission and some of it's servants to live through the independence of the Congo and the following civil war. UPDATE:Research quantifying the impact of protestant missionaries around the world. A summary:http://www.breakpoint.org/bpcommentar...Scholarly publication in American Political Science Review, here:https://www.academia.edu/2128659/The_...PS. I believe this to be the WORST review I have ever written on Goodreads, yet it is the most discussed! I was so annoyed by the material, I didn't want to spend the time to polish my thoughts - I just wanted to be done with it! Yes, now I regret it. For what I consider better work, and no less controversial, check out my review and follow up comments/ discussion of Roots by Alex Haley."
582,1000 Families,Uwe Ommer,4.13,15,2,Ruth,5,"I disagree with the other review. Although the families photographed may display some stereotypical qualities, they are unique individuals. I enjoyed reading the tidbits about each family. He does blend in some non-traditional families. I just finished reading about the Central Asian families included and was surprised by how many of them had migrant parents who began their lives in other parts of Asia or Europe. He includes some contemporary styled city families as well as more traditional families from the countryside. Initially I was annoyed that I could not simple flip to a section labeled Central Asia instead of having all of the areas mixed together on every page of the book, but I believe his theory in mixing them up is to show the similarities between families from around the world and to create a feeling of closeness in the Global Family. The style is a success in that. I have not read the entire book, but keep it at hand to peruse from time to time. Like humanity, it's never boring."
579,Virgin All-time Top 1000 Albums,Colin Larkin,3.64,22,2,Patrick Neylan,4,"Larkin collates all the serious lists of 'top albums' and makes a master list. In that sense it's an objective list, but the write-ups of the records themselves are opinionated, as they should be. That said, he's got something good to say about everything, and he can't like them all. Such encyclopedic knowledge is impressive, and the reviews contain enough warmth and humour, even the bad ones (definition of a bad review: one I disagree with). Take the list with a pinch of salt (the best five albums of all time are shared between the Beatles and Radiohead), but the positions don't matter. It's a list of 1000 great albums with enough to get you interested in finding something new. That's the real point."

Was there truly not a single benefit of colonialism? Were all businessmen/ westerners culpable or colluding? Were all involved in the downfall of the Congo Christians? Were not the African leader, Mbuto (funded by the US, yes) and his followers not equally guilty of selling out Africans for personal gain? Were there not some westerners (like the noble parents of the author mentioned in the prelude) trying to make life better for Africans? Is this not the same thing we see currently in Zimbabwe? If we are going to examine evil and exploitation, let's remember that no one person, country, or even time, has a lock on it. And lets not paint extreme pictures of those we chose to reject, while painting those we agree with in glowing terms. As with many fictional accounts, we don't like to admit the good and the bad falls on both sides.*Christianity is merely a tool people use to exploit others and promote their own agenda. I fundamentally disagree with this perspective. Christianity is a relationship with Christ that involves following after Him and becoming more like Him.The extreme situation the author creates in this fictional account allows her to proclaim her philosophies of life with vigor, particularly anti-Christianity and anti-Americanism. In the foreword, she makes effort to point out that her parents (who went to the Congo in the same time period) have NOTHING in common with the main subjects of the work, essentially preparing the reader for the assault upon the southern baptist missionary and his 4 children from Georgia who are the main characters.With such flaws, a work should be easily dismissed. However, there are some glowing strong points. The writing is exceptional, and there are many rich scenes that are not soon forgotten. The understanding of African life, customs, language and landscape as well as the ability to portray this amazingly beautiful land as a living organism were compellingly impressed upon my mind. The character development and interaction of perspectives (each chapter is the perspective of one character, the book being a series of their interwoven stories), is extraordinary; though it is noteworthy that the author doesn't include a single chapter from the perspective of the husband/father/missionary zealot of the family, but only permits him to be defined by the others. I really cared about the characters and wanted to know what would happen to them.The examination of cross-cultural interaction and communication is powerfully illustrated as we begin with a purely American perspective that slowly opens (through the eyes of some, not all, characters) to an African perspective.While it might be a helpful work to those longing to know Africa or understand cross-cultural disconnects, I cannot give it more than two stars because of the blatant agenda referenced above.ADDENDUM: For those really wanting to understand the history of the Congo, including the dark side of it's formation, I recommend ""King Leopold's Ghost"" by Adam Hochschild. Hochschild's work is well told, enjoyable even to non-historians, and will give an excellent picture of the dynamics (both the good and the evil) at work in the Congo. Looking back, compared to the exceptional ""King Leopold's Ghost"", Poisonwood Bible was an incredible waste of time - i'm lowering it to one star.Tom Hiney's ""On the Missionary Trail"" is also excellent in content, though not as well written, for those interested in the lives of ordinary (meaning not generally famous) missionaries around the world.King Leopold's Ghost, Hochschild, 1999https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...On the Missionary Trail, Hiney, 2001https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...Give Me this Mountain, Roseveare, 1966https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...This is a non-fiction memoir written by a missionary serving in the Congo during the time period covered by Kingsolver.

7482,Human Traces,Sebastian Faulks,3.61,3379,288,Maciek,3,"Human Traces is a a huge and ambitious novel, which aims to explore the development of psychiatry, psychoanalysis and neurology in the late 19th and early 20th century. It took Sebastian Faulks five years to write, and involved spending hundreds of hours on research and creating charts and timelines to keep track of events and characters. The novel begins in the 1876, with the introduction of the two protagonists - Jacques Rebiere and Thomas Midwinter. They are both 16 years old, and although separated by social status, language and land, they both undergo personal experiences which make them wish to become doctors. Jacques is a poor boy living in rural France, forced to abandon his education and an early age and work in the villages to support his family. Jacques is fascinated with anatomy and dissects frogs in his spare time, drawing detailed illustrations. But what he most wishes for is to understand madness: he wishes to be able to cure his brother, Olivier, who succumbed into it and is forced to live locked in the stable, shackled to the wall. Oliver was the last person to have seen their mother, as she died shortly after giving birth to Jacques. Their father refuses to talk about his late wife, and Jacques sees in Oliver the only chance to learn anything about her.In England, Thomas Midwinter dreams to study Shakespeare andbelieves that literature allows for understanding of humanity. For Thomas, literature deepens the perceivement of emotions and heightens one's awareness of being alive. He is met with scorn from his father, who is experiencing financial troubles and is forced to arrange a marriage for Thomas's sister, Sonia. It is Sonia who advises Thomas to study medicine, as itwill also allow him to study the nature of humanity...and guarantee a respectable income.These early sections show Faulks at his very best; they're compelling and evocative. full of humanity and wonder. Although the hardships which Jacques faces are overwhelming, he never gives up: his devotion to knowledge and understanding is admirable and beautifully shown, and his love for his brother and the mother he never saw compensates for all sacrifices. Thomas is forced to abandon his dreams of studying literature, like his sister is forced to enter into marriage; both will have to shape their lives this way and not the other because of the place and time they were born in. When the lives of Jacques and Thomas intersect, both discover that the other shares the same fascination: both pledge to pursue further understanding of the human condition and all that comes with it, and eventually set up their own clinic. With time, each begins to form a different hypothesis: Jacques believes that traumatic experiences at a young age can are the cause of madness and schizophrenia, while Thomas remains a strict naturalist and believes that mental and physical problems are genetic. This is fascinating material, and the novel promises to be a wonderful experience. Sally Vickers in The Times compared it to works by Balzac, Stendhal and Mann, praising its scope and ambition - the novel's canvas encompasses three continents. It spans several decades and generations, and is victorian in its lenght and drama: from sweeping love affairs to tragic death, journeys to faraway lands and even war and its tragedy, all this with exploration of scientific, religious and philosophical themes.Yet, as a novel, it is greatly flawed. The main sin it commits against the art of storytelling is the sheer amount of exposition: after the brilliant opening it lapses into a display of its impressive background research, with the characters becoming little more than speakers for the author who illustrate his points; several chapters are devoted to long and academic discussion over the nature of mental illness, and in one chapter a whole lecture is transcribed from beginning to end. These chapters could have been edited and shortened to a portion of their lenght; the pace and dramatic impact of the narrative would greatly gain from such treatment. Likewise, the portions of the novel set in Africa and California seem to be more of a recounting of the research that went into writing them than genuine parts of the storyline; the plot starts looking as if the story was so framed to fit the background research - which would explain several improbable coincidences - than the research resulting from the nature of the story and the characters which populate it, moving very linearly and mostly predictably and perfunctorily. It's as if the sheer amount of ideas was too large for its canvas, forcing Faulks to cut his characterization short in order to present psychoanalysis and psychiatry with the attention and detail he felt it deserved.The novel shines with insividual sequences - descriptions of mental asylums and the patients within them are haunting and effective, with one feeling their squalor and despair - but on the whole the plot and character interactions feel scripted, the novel's world tailored only to present its themes and not allowed to evolve and live on its own. Still, despite these factors it's not a failure: it is an intelligent work, and the author's devotion to the subject and representation of science from that period, with its many doubts but also enormous promise, is to be acknowleged and praised. The novel begins to regain the opening grandeur as it nears towards the end, with events which I found bitterly ironic and deeply saddening. The end of Human Traces is powerful and sublime, written in passages echoing with quiet beauty. It's almost cathartic in effect, purifying the artificual plot with truly human emotions; I closed the book forgiving it its flawed and weak parts, being glad that I was able to experience the strong and beautiful."

3858,Holy Cow: An Indian Adventure,Sarah Macdonald,3.52,14332,1092,Petra Eggs,4,"India as a giant spiritual supermarket! Sarah Macdonald peruses the aisles and samples the product. Jainism here, Judaism there, Hindus, Parsis, Buddhists, Sufis and Christians she samples all their wares. And the book is just about as superficial as it sounds. It is not about these religions (although Sarah does try for some depth) but about her experiences of them with some rather wacky people. Both the 'magical' gurus and the hippie-types who sit at their feet and swoon.Sarah, like the adventuresome Australian she is, backpacks to India, has a crap time, leaves but meets an ugly old soothsayer who tells her she will come back to India and find lurrrrve. And eleven years later she comes back with her boyfriend. He works in broadcasting and is always off covering the latest insurrection and massacre with the high point being Afghanistan. So to fill in the time she becomes a spiritual tourist shopping for the 'truth'.Now this is the interesting part. She really does see India as it seems to be, a society of great contrasts. Whether it is between rich and poor, or the religions, the languages or the cultures everyone (apart from those involved in insurrections and massacres) meaning the ordinary people, just rub along together. She goes to ashrams, temples, 'coffee shops' in Nepal and other places of worship and attempts to learn the path about who we are and where we are going. There isn't any universal path to be found, everyone has to make their own, or not bother (me, the apatheist). Quite a lot of these spiritual homes charge a lot of money for imposing fairly punishing regimes on Westerners who would seek the truth. Religion is quite an industry in India.One of the funniest parts of the book is detailing the various people she meets. I would never have guessed that the stonedest least spiritual tourists around are the Israelis who are considerably less precious than the sort of hippie type travellers she meets in the Hindu ashrams (think Shantaram). The most fanatical people are the Parsis, known as Zoroastrians in Iran, who are the most exclusive of exclusive types in the world. No one can convert and no child that doesn't have both parents from the Parsee community is accepted. The group she met saw the preservation of that exclusivity as the most important part of their culture and are willing to accept the problems of inbreeding that results from this. Their other preoccupation is breeding vultures - pollution seems to be killing them off - so that their dead can be eaten by them in their traditional funeral rites.The book took me about six months to read. I just couldn't get into it. I kept it next to the stove in the kitchen and read a few pages when I had to stir something and as it went on it got more interesting. It helps that the author can write well. It helps that she has a very strong, somewhat bolshy, opinionated personality, very Australian, and it was more Sarah MacDonald, the author, who sucked me. I wanted to know what she would do next much more than I cared about 'the next'.So three and a half stars rounded up to four because Sarah is just the sort of person you'd love to go out to lunch with and amid the chatter she would tell you about how these a-mazing people she met in India are coming to stay and would you like to meet them? How about dinner... Oh yes, you think, I'll bring a couple of bottles."
3856,User Stories Applied: For Agile Software Development (Addison Wesley Signature Series),Mike Cohn,3.9,1726,94,Aleksander,3,"User Stories Applied: For Agile Software Development is a decent introduction to user stories. The book could have benefitted from more depth on user stories and a little less breadth on adjoining topics. It is from 2004 and is starting to show its age.The user story is a frequently used tool in agile software development methods such as eXtreme Programming (XP) and Scrum. It is used both for documenting the existence of a requirement and as a worm package for use in scope planning and scheduling. This is possible due to the incremental nature of agile methods. Work is decomposed into work packaged along user goal and contain all or at least most of the steps in the software development lifecycle. This in contrast with sequential methods where the work is decomposed by type instead.User stories with the addition of conditions for satisfaction (high-level acceptance test cases) is the most important artefact in the communication between the customer team and development team. This interface is probably the hardest to get right in IT and being to able to write good user stories would be a great boon.The book is from 2004 and is beginning to show its age. I think Cohn might have changed his mind on some things since then, for instance on the use of ideal days as the measure of a story point. Scrum no longer insists on 30-day sprints. The Wideband Delphi technique for estimating user stories described by Cohn is now usually referred to as planning poker.The age becomes apparent in another way as well. For some reason Cohn writes a lot about subjects only tangentially related user stories. There are even introductions to both Scrum and eXtreme Programming in there. That might have made sense in a time where these were not as well known as they are today.Despite this, the book is a decent introduction to user stories, what they are, how to write them and how to use them, complete with a case study. It is pretty short, not a bad thing per se, but it also tries to cover a great range of topics. This means there is not much space left to go into detail on the user stories themselves. I would have liked more both on developing roles and personas and on the ""trawling"" for user stories. As it is, anyone already familiar with agile methods will find them selves skipping big parts of the book.As always with Cohn, the book is well written and easy to follow."
3860,O Holy Cow!: The Selected Verse,Phil Rizzuto,4.27,55,6,Charles,3,"Phil (The Scooter) Rizzuto was the regular shortstop for the New York Yankees for the years 1941-1956. After retiring from baseball, he went on to be a fixture as a radio and television announcer for Yankee games. Rizzuto developed a very unusual style, often engaging in non sequitur tangents that had little or nothing to do with the action on the field. This book is a collection of some of those oddball moments.  There is nothing here in the form of verse or thoughtful prose, sometimes you do not really understand what he said after you read it. While some are charmed by what Rizzuto said, it is often so difficult to comprehend that I found it off-putting. For there is no insight into the beauty and complexities of baseball, where weird plays can happen at any time.  However, I did learn that his trademark expression was, “O Holy Cow!” a remark that I thought had originated with Harry Caray. "
656,War and Peace,Leo Tolstoy,4.11,196492,8255,Jessica,4,"So, I know you've all been on edge these past two months, and since I should be studying for the social work licensing exam tonight, it seems like the perfect time to put an end to your suspense.After all my agonizing and the thoughtful suggestions below about whether I should mutilate my gorgeous hardcover Pevear and Volokhonsky translation in the interest of less hazardous subway toting.... Readers, I carried him. All 1272 pages. Every day, across five boroughs and three states, for nearly two months....So the burning question on your mind is, ""Should I risk misalignment and a redislocated shoulder in the interest of preserving a pristine edition that's inevitably going to get all banged up anyway, as I lug it across battlefields and through trenches, for what seems an eternity? Which is more important: the book's spine, or my own?""Bookster, I am here to put an end to all this wondering! Here is what you must do: simply take a keen exacto knife (you might ask a helpful Cossack to sharpen it for you), and slice out the final ""Epilogue"" portion of this burdensome tome. You will do no damage to the book -- the epilogue's like an appendix (and hey, what the hell, cut that out too) -- as this part is not necessary, and in fact though it's theoretically only about 7% of the book, this portion is actually responsible for at least 63% of its weight. So slice that bitch out, and throw it away! Your vertebrae will thank you later.Another advantage to getting rid of the Epilogue is that it will save you from having to read what is conceivably the most deadly dull and deflating ending to a vast and magnificently readable book, ever written. As a particularly exacting size queen, I demand that the glory of a huge novel's ending be proportional to its length. I feel this is only fair: I was loyal and patient, and devoted many hours to reading the author's story, and at the end I should be rewarded for my fortitude with a glorious finale. That's always been my philosophy, anyway. Apparently, though, it's not Tolstoy's.What is Tolstoy's philosophy, you ask? In particular, what's his philosophy of history? Well, let me tell you! Or better, let him tell you. Cause he will. Over and over. And then again. And then, in case you were interested and wanted to know more, let him REALLY tell you.... and keep telling you.... and tell you some more.... and some more.... no, let him get into it finally now, in great detail.Yeah, Tolstoy's that perfect house guest who crashed on your couch for nearly two months and you're just thrilled as hell the whole time to have him visiting, because he's just such a smart and great and interesting and heartfelt guy. Quel raconteur! Oh, sure, sometimes he gets a bit dull and wonky with his policy ramblings, but that stuff's basically okay. And then yeah, he's got these ideés fixes about history that are fine, you guess, but it's a bit weird how he's always repeating them and focusing on the same points over and over, and he will corner your roommate's friend or a classmate you run into at the supermarket, or an old lady waiting for the bus, to explain yet again why he thinks Napoleon really isn't that great at ALL, yeah, that's odd, but basically Leo is just super, and you're thrilled to have him -- even for such an extended visit -- because he really is so brilliant and diverting and nearly truly worth his weight in gold.... You are sad to know he's going to leave, but then his plane is delayed and you're happy you'll have him there just one more night, but somehow that's the night that he suddenly decides to come back to your house, completely high on cocaine. Leo then proceeds to stay up for hours drinking all your expensive scotch and talking your EAR off about his goddamn PHILOSOPHY of HISTORY that you really just could not care LESS about, and he WILL not leave and let you go to bed, he keeps TALKING, and it's BORING, and apparently he thinks your catatonic stare signals rapt interest, because he just keeps on going, explaining, on and on -- He WILL NOT SHUT UP! It is almost just like being physically tortured, by this guy who you'd thought was the best houseguest in the whole wide world. And so when Leo finally leaves again the next morning -- ragged and bleary and too dazed still to be properly sheepish -- you're not sorry to see him go, in fact you're very glad. And does one annoying night cancel out two months of the great times you had together? Of course it doesn't, and you remember him fondly, and tell anyone who asks how nice it was when he stayed. But the night does carry a special weight because it was the last, and when you remember dear Leo, your wonderful houseguest, your affection will not be totally untainted by the memory of his dull, egotistical, coked-out rantings, the night before he left for real.By which I mean to say, the rest of this book was totally great! As my Great Aunt Dot (who's read this twice) commented, ""It's really not a difficult read at all; there's a chapter about War, and then a chapter about Peace, so it never gets boring."" War and Peace is hugely entertaining, and largely readable. Plus, it's enormously educational, as you will be forced to learn more than you ever wanted to know about the great Napoleon! (According to Tolstoy, he wasn't that great. No, I mean really, he wasn't that great.) War and Peace is a terrific date book, because it's got lots of bloody action and also tons of romance, plus you can make out during the dull parts where Tolstoy's talking for like twelve pages about various generals and strategies and his nineteenth-centuried out opinions about history.If there's a standard I value more highly than my long-book-great-ending demand, it's the one that I call ""Make Me Cry."" I don't really think a book's that great unless it makes me cry. (No, this doesn't work in the other direction -- just because a book makes me cry doesn't mean it's great. I've cried at really silly movies before, and I used to cry regularly whenever I read the newspaper, which is one reason I stopped.) War and Peace made me cry like a colicky baby that's been speared with a bayonet, THREE TIMES! I don't mean I misted up or got a little chokey -- I mean I sobbed, wept, and groaned, thoroughly broke down and lost my shit on a very cathartic and soul-rending level. Hooray! I can't guarantee that War and Peace will also make you cry, but I bet if you're prone to that sort of thing, you've got a good shot.GOD this book is good. See, you should really skip the Epilogue, because besides being crushingly dull, it's also very depressing (in the wrong way), and in addition to making you vow never to marry could make you forget how GREAT and AMAZING the rest of this is. What a GREAT and AMAZING book! Holy shit! I'm flipping through now, and it's all coming back to me. This was totally The Wire of 1868: If you like serious character development and plotting that unfolds over a long period of time, you should seriously read this book. I really didn't know much about this book before I read it, but I think I remember someone -- Jane Smiley? -- writing that War and Peace is about everything. I wouldn't go along with that (I'm not sure if she would either), but it is about most of the things that really matter. If you are someone who thinks at all about life or death, you might like this book. Here is a passage, from a character who's a POW marching barefoot through Russia in October:In captivity in the shed, [he] had learned, not with his mind, but with his whole being, his life, that man is created for happiness, that happiness is within him, in the satisfying of human needs, and that all unhappiness comes not from lack, but from superfluity; but now, in these last three weeks of the march, he had learned a new and more comforting truth -- he had learned that there is nothing frightening in the world. He had learned that, as there is no situation in the world in which a man can be happy and perfectly free, so there is no situation in which he can be perfectly unhappy and unfree. He had learned that there is a limit to suffering and a limit to freedom, and that those limits are very close; that the man who suffers because one leaf is askew in his bed of roses, suffers as much as he now suffered falling asleep on the bare, damp ground, one side getting cold as the other warmed up; that when he used to put on his tight ballroom shoes, he suffered just as much as now, when he walked quite barefoot (his shoes had long since worn out) and his feet were covered with sores. (p. 1060)I just think that's great. Maybe it's not, out of context.... Anyway, one of the best things about reading this is how much of it is so strange -- Russia! 1812! OMFG! all so different! -- and how much is the same. The nuance, specificity, and instant recognizability of the characters in here is pretty amazing. I know this sounds dumb, but you really feel like you know these people, and in a way it's the minor characters -- Sonya, Anatole, Dolokhov (my favorite!) -- who are so perfectly drawn, and make you go, ""Man! I know these people! Woah!""I did appreciate having to think about war while reading this, because that's something I've never really done before. At the beginning I'd hoped that this would help me understand more about why wars happen, but it didn't. That might have been what Tolstoy was trying to explain in his Epilogue, but I have to confess that at that point, I wasn't really listening.Anyway, I liked this book. It is long, though."
699,"America: A Concise History, Volume 2: Since 1865",James A. Henretta,3.79,67,4,Raymond,4,"This is more a quick survey of important events and conditions from the period of reconstruction to modern day. It is immensely readable for those who enjoy history; I think this judgment of readability will hold up even for those who may not enjoy reading and pondering history quite so much.An interesting assertation about judical restrait- when the Supreme Court, prior to Franklin D. Roosevelt, was consistently supporting the rights of business over the rights of the public, Liberals were supportive of ""judicial restraint"" and States' Rights and the Conservatives were gung ho for interventionist rulings.

701,"Government in America: People, Politics, and Policy",George C. Edwards III,3.34,98,14,Christina,3,"It’s your basic textbook. It’s neither bad nor great. Its text is both interesting and boring. It has the ability to make politics - my favorite subject- boring and even more fascinating all at the same time.Government in America: People, Politics, and Policy could be better if the authors were a little less condescending and talked to their readers like they were having a conversation. But it’s certainly not the worst textbook I’ve ever read, and I appreciated how often graphics, colored text boxes, and memory-jogging photographs were used."
604,"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market",Eric Schlosser,3.76,5544,419,David Sarkies,4,"Investigating America's Vices19 June 2013	Written the author of Fast Food Nation, this book contains three case studies that each dealing with an area of the black market: marijuana, immigrant workers in the strawberry fields on California, and the hard core porn industry. As one can expect from Schlosser, it is a thoroughly researched and tries to look at these industries in an objective manner, and does not necessarily try to conclude with some left wing conspiracy.	Basically there are lots of books that cover the topic of marijuana in the United States and the war on drugs. Being an Australian where possession of small amounts (up to three ounces in some places) is pretty much a misdemeanor that results in a small fine, it is difficult to understand the nature of the war on drugs as it plays out in the United States. In a way the war itself is scary because it has been suggested that if you are caught with even one joint you can be classified as a dealer, locked up, and have all of your possessions confiscated, even before you have been convicted. In a way I believe that this is a really heavy handed approach, particularly since the laws date back to the 1930s, where the Dupont company pushed for the criminalisation of marijuana so that it could dominate the textile industry.	Another argument is also that since it is only recently that marijuana has become a popular Anglo-saxon drug (up until the sixties marijuana was predominantly a Mexican pleasure, and its narcotic purposes were only used in cure-all potions made by chemists, who in those days did not necessarily need a license to practice). Unfortunately, it is very difficult to access anything these days on the history of drugs and drug use since many of these documentaries are generally not made, or if they are, do not appear on the mainstream media (unless of course its message is 'Drugs are bad'). In a way, it feels as if marijuana did not exist prior to the sixties, and that modern drugs, such as meth-amphetamine, did not exist until the late 90s (which is not true because allegedly Hitler used it during World War II and also apparently fed it to his troops).	It appears however that this book is about the black market and how the black market influences all of our lives. In a way we are all exposed to the black market, whether we smoke pot, or rent dodgy videos from those dodgy video stores that have no windows. This is where the second case study comes into play: illegal immigrants. Schlosser looks at the strawberry growers, but this applies to a lot of industries across the United States (and while it happens in Australia, the fact that we do not have any land borders with poorer nations, we have a lot less illegal immigrants than do the United States). The reason illegal immigrants are so popular is because the laws do not apply to them, so they can be paid under the minimum wage, which means more profits for the business owner, and that they are not affected by the unfair dismissal laws (or any of the other laws that apply to legitimate employees).	While the section on the porn industry applies to the black market as well, much of this has more to do with the freedom of speech amendment than it has to do with the black market (even though while the industry was fighting the obscenity laws the profits coming from the porn industry were effectively a part of the black market). Mind you, this section surprised me because I was expecting it to deal with Hugh Heffner or Larry Flynt, but they barely made a mention in this section. I guess the reason is that we are dealing not with what is termed as soft porn (if there is such a thing) but with hard core pornography. Mind you, porn has been around as long as there have been people willing to pay for it (even though before photography, we had to pay for live shows, and then we might as well go to a brothel), however with the advent of film, television, and now the internet, access to it has become a lot easier."
700,Rereading America: Cultural Contexts for Critical Thinking and Writing,Gary Colombo,3.71,260,23,Jagged,3,"I had to read this for my college diversity English class. I read it before my classes started, and again throughout my course. There are some interesting essays in here and some interesting opinions--but they are just that. We used topics from the book as our weekly discussions so I was able to get a lot of different interpretations of this book, which was unique to me. So, for the setting in which this book was used, I think it was a great fit.The problem with this book is that it only tackled one side of things, not multiple sides of the issues. For example, when it talks about the issues with the LGBTI and gay marriage, the only side you see is the side of the LGBTI and gays fighting for marriage equality. You are not shown how things went down for the religious, or even government officials. So it's very one-dimensional, and at times felt very much like attempted indoctrination. The way that feminist issues were handled was extremely disappointing as well. One of the things the book mentions is that there would be some offensive topics in here, but I was really only offended by the lack of depth and thought provocation provided. This book actually encourages racism and sexism at times with the content offered, because there is nothing to compare it to. It really suggests that you single everyone out for what race they are, what sex they are, and what sexual orientation they assign to, and then make sure you think about those differences without actually addressing them. So, this is not a book that I took too seriously once I realized it. It sure is eye opening at times, but for the most part I felt that it was just a load of propaganda being pushed to sway readers to the author's opinions on matters. Even the questions being asked at the end of essays only ask one dimensional things. You are not really encouraged to delve deeper into what you really believe, only what the author's of the book want to push you towards."
776,Buddhism Plain and Simple,Steve Hagen,4.1,5055,339,Bookdragon Sean ,3,"Is Buddhism really plain and simple? I think not. The more I read on Buddhism the more I find I need to read. This book has led to a spiralling off of an entire arc of spiritual texts I feel I need to get to grips with. I have loads sat on my shelf, and I have loads I need to learn. Last month I almost signed up for a Buddhist meditation class in part because of this book. It pushed me further down the road of perhaps one day living this belief system fully. Unfortunately life got in the way and I didn’t go to the group. Next year when I have more time I will actually go to it. Buddhism is more than just you and I. It is about the universe and positive energy; it is about making the most out of existence and understanding that all life is precious no matter what form: it is about peace and happiness. Wouldn’t the world be a better place if all word powers relinquished power to a ruling body of Buddhist monks? I speak of idealism, but these men understand the human mind more than most. “It’s called enlightenment. It’s nothing more or less than seeing things as they are rather than we wish or believe them to be.”"

The story of a North Atlantic Convoy at the beginning of World War Two. The book will remind readers of what our country owes to the men of the Merchant Navy and Royal Navy during this period.The Battle of the Atlantic raged for five years and eight months, a bitter and intense battle through which seamen endured the horrors of Hell on Earth. Suffering and death were their constant companions. Their efforts to protect and maintain the vtal supply lines were of paramount importance in support of the allied war effort in Europe.This book comes under a 'Must Read' category and I commend it to both young and old.Richard Kinsella (former seaman)"

8207,The Laughing Savior: The Discovery and Significance of the Nag Hammadi Gnostic Library,John Dart,3.43,7,1,Salvatore Leone,4,"John Dart's book, published in 1976, offers a good summary of what was known about the codices discovered near Nag Hammadi, Egypt soon after World War II. These were Gnostic writings buried for over a thousand years. This book describes the history of the codices and then offers a summation of important themes and ideas expressed in them. The author, a religion news reporter, writes the book for 'ordinary' people, not just those who are expert at these kinds of writings. Made for interesting reading."
9112,The Art of Portrait Drawing: Learn the Essential Techniques of the Masters,Joy Thomas,3.71,31,2,Kevin de Ataíde,4,"An interesting, although a very short book, good for an introduction. The first half, quite promising, describes the author's techniques and her basic set-up. The second half, with the step-by-step projects, relies very much upon the personal experience of the artist, and is better a window on her creative process than a detailed instruction. I thought best of the Conclusion of the book, where the author describes her attempts to find a decent art instruction in her youth and the usual opposition she discovered from the modernism in the art schools and how she was able to overcome it with her enthusiasm for her work. Three stars."

5267,Edith Wharton,R.W.B. Lewis,4.07,289,17,Michael,3,"This biography of Edith Wharton won the Pulitzer and Bancroft prizes when it came out. And I am only on p. 31 at this moment, but I am already finding a lot of thud moments in the writing. His big interpretations seem labored, prosaic, and debatable. I am simultaneously reading Edith Wharton: An Extraordinary Life - an Illustrated Biography, which is only 280 pages with pictures on almost every one, yet it gives more rounding to the person Edith Wharton was than the prize-winning bio does, at least for me. I am afraid Lewis's book is going to prove very much a professor's book. For all the details I am going to learn, I get the feeling the real woman will never appear before my eyes as I read it. Which is quite a shame, because for me Wharton and Faulkner are the two great American writers none of the others can quite approach. She is certainly a favorite of mine. Will update when I finish. Hope I am wrong, as there are still 500 pages to go!In the end, a thorough and fair accounting of her life and I upgraded my rating to three stars. Three appendices cover (a) the possibility, believed by some of her best friends, that Edith had a different father than her beloved George Frederic Jones; (b) the remarkable romantic career of her lover Morton Fullerton; and (c) the detailed outline and erotic fragment of an unusual story called ""Beatrice Palmato,"" about an incestuous relationship, found in her papers long after Mrs. Wharton's death."
5230,Vergeef me,Wally Lamb,4.17,259487,7837,Heather,5,"This is a book I have been meaning to read since 1997. That's actually even before it was officially published, which might seem weird, if you didn't already know that Wally Lamb was teaching writing at my high school at the time he was working on this novel; and if you didn't know that my freshman English class helped ""edit"" one of the first chapters, back in 1994 or 1995.The novel tells the story of Dominick and Thomas Birdsey, identical twins dealing with very fraternal problems, namely that Thomas is schizophrenic, and Dominick is almost his last remaining caregiver. The novel is about many things, but most of all, as told from Dominick's perspective, it is about forgiveness of the self, of family, of our pasts, both personal and collective. I know a number of the people named in the acknowledgements (including several of my high school teachers), and my high school gets a shout-out as well. I didn't know Lamb very well, but I always found him pretty favorable, one of those teachers you like because they never actually have to give you a grade. I never read this book until now because I also have a connection to one of those named in the dedication: to Sam Deglin, a high school friend who, along with her younger brother Randy, was killed in a freak car accident in front of our high school in January of 1997. I knew she and Randy were named in the dedication, and for this reason, I avoided the book. I didn't want to know how their deaths connected wtih the story, and I didn't want to be reminded at all of my hometown in southeastern Connecticut, where I assumed (correctly, it turns out) the book was set.I think enough time passed in order for me to feel OK about this book...and in fact, once I began reading, I couldn't stop. The references to people, places, and events of my hometown were only part of the allure: this book is beautifully written, and the structure of the novel - which jumps back and forth between the 1920s, 1940s, 1960s, and 1980s with refreshingly little unnecessary exposition - contributes to the sense that, like the mind of Thomas Birdsey (who I guess you could call the ""antagonist""), things are never what they seem, and that sometimes the answers to our biggest fears and questions were right in front of us, all along. I would recommend this book highly, but it certainly helps to know a thing or two about growing up in Norwich, Connecticut too!"

Lamb hasn't written an actual story so much as he's bound together a series of advice columns and chat show episodes dressed up in vague narrative form. The girl's father leaves! Then she gets raped! Then she gains weight! Then her roommate is mean to her! Then she hooks up with a bad boyfriend! Then some more bad things happen to her after that! And more still after that! And on and on, ad nauseam. Someone should have told Lamb that dreaming up parade of horribles isn't the same as writing a novel. Save yourself 500 pages and watch a couple episodes of Dr. Phil instead. Awful, awful, awful book. If I could give it less than one star, I would.Addendum: Every so often, someone comes along and flags this review as having spoilers. Complaining about spoilers in this review is, not to put too fine a point on it, really stupid. Most of the plot points I mention here are either in the actual cover copy of the book, in the Goodreads summary, or occur somewhere within the first ten pages or so. The rest are so vague (e.g., hooking up with a bad boyfriend -- a plot point that probably occurs in some form in, oh, half of the books ever written) that if you consider them ""spoilers,"" I'm not really sure why you read book reviews at all.Further addendum: If you're about to complain about spoilers in this review, please see comment 56 below."
5434,Defending the West: A Critique of Edward Said's Orientalism,Ibn Warraq,3.52,86,9,Gary,5,"Edward Said's fraudulent work, first published in 1978, has had a growing pernicious effect on the world, as have his hateful and deceitful works on the Arab-Israel conflict.Said's polemic has very much become the accepted dogma of university departments across the world that study any of the subjects covered by 'Orientalism'. Ibn Warraq refutes the perfidious lies of Said meticulously and with brutal candour in this antidote to Said's pro-Islamo-Fascist and nihilist Far Left propaganda.The effect of Said's work has been to slander the valuable work of generations of genuine scholars on the Middle East and Islamic world. but his work has gone much further than academia. He taught an entire generation of Muslims and Arabs 'the art of self-pity' which has led to the rise of Islamo-Nazi fundamentalism and terror that is the biggest threat to the freedom and decency of the world today.Warraq points out Said in his fraudulent creation of the concept of ""the other"", a cliche rammed down the throats of university students around the world, is never used to apply to non-Muslims or even non-Arabs in the Islamic world.Peoples such as the Copts, Maronites, Mandaens, Samaritans, Assyrians, Greek Orthodox Christians, Chaldeans, Berbers Zoroastrians, Baha'is and especially Jews are denied the status of Orientals and the protected status of 'the Other'. They simply do not exist in the world of Said and his intellectual followers.I have long waited for the chance to voice my opinion that the concept of 'the Other' is a massive fraud perpetrated by leftwing intellectuals which simply means selected groups of people favoured and protected by the Left who ignore the suffering and victimization of other people, thus practising exactly what they accuse Westwerners, conservatives etc of doing to those they chosen to term 'the Other'Warraq uses this term for convenience as he refers to as a 'temporary verbal surrender' , while identifying it for the dishonest cliche that it is.Warraq's brilliant analysis of the engagement the West with Eastern and Islamic cultures go's some way to both explaining that there has been much positive in western civilization and influence and that Western culture has been most open to receiving and understanding the cultures of others while Islam since 900 CE at the latest has rejected input from other cultures and civilizations as well as rejecting the pursuit of knowledge for the sake of knowledge, which is echoed in Said's contempt for science.This loathing of science and the truth and denigration of Western civilization is revealed by an exhibit at the Ontario Science Center at Toronto which gives way to such unbelievable, almost surreal relativism claiming ""Modern Western science puts the sun at the center of the solar system. but other points of view are not necessarily wrong or primitive""UnbelievableWarraq wishes to encourage progress and a true spirit of questioning in the Islamic and Arab world. but what males this almost impossible as well as any criticism of Islam in the West is Said's Orientalism which taught an entire generation the art of self-pity: 'Were it not for the wicked imperialists, racists and Zionists we would be great once more"".The propaganda and falsehood by self-pity, postimiperialist victimhood and rantings about 'imperialism' is an ""immature and unattractive quality"" we owe of so much contemporary Middle Eastern culture. This paranoid conspiracy mentality is encapsulated by Said's 1980 work ""The Question of Palestine"" where he bizarrely charges that Zionism was created by the West purely to keep Islam at bay! Again unbelievableSaid and his followers interpret intellectual and political history in a highly, in short twisting the truth which Said does not seem to believe in anyway.Warraq details the Arab role in beginning the slave trade which continues in Africa and the Middle East today and points out that the movement AGAINST slavery began in the West and it was in the West where slavery was first abolished.Warraq takes apart the accepted blaming of only the West for all evils in the world today pointing out that ""Europe has been guilty of terrible crimes but what civilization has not been?"" Confining ourselves to the twentieth century the sins of the West are no worse than the crimes and follies of Asia. Warraq then documents the killing of 70 million Chinese by Mao, and one fifth of Cambodia's population by Pol Pot. The massacres of three hundred thousand people in Uganda by Idi Amin or of 800 000 in Rwanda in 1994. The genocide of 1.8 million people in Sudan, including at least three hundred thousand in Darfur. The crimes of Saddam Hussein, the chemical of the town of Hama by Hafez al Assad in 1982 in which 40 000 people die, and the 2 million people who have died in Iran because of the policies of the Islamic Republic.Warraq dismantles Said's highly faulty and fraudulent methodology. He describes also how the very tolerance of the West has led to what he so eruditely refers to the bufooneries of Michael Moore, the exaggeration of Robert Fisk and the fanaticism of Noam Chomsky"" all of these apologists for Islamo-Nazi atrocities and terror.Warraq examines the real agenda of Islamism ignored in the mainstream media and universities. He also covers the horrific abuse of women and children in Islamic societies again condoned and ignored by leftwing intellectuals.As he describes Iran: ""The hypocrisy of the Islamic Republic of Iran should now be apparent The West does not need lectures on the superior virtue of societies in which women are kept in subjection, endure clitoridectomies, are stoned to death for alleged adultery, have acid thrown on their faces, are married off against their will at the age of nine. or where the human rights of those considered to belong to lower castes are denied""This book should be required reading for all students of the humanities brainwashed by Said's perfidious and dishonest agitprop."
5450,The Founding Fathers and the Place of Religion in America,Franklin T. Lambert,4.03,58,6,Jared,4,"Excellent work, with one exception...Dr. Lambert does not provide adequate attention to the impact of theological unitarianism in his review of the faiths of the main Founding Fathers. How can you discuss this topic and only mention Dr./Rev. Joseph Priestly only twice? But other than this oversight, this is a very good piece of scholarship. Some of the quotations he provides are typically not found in these types of books and they are very illuminating. The author clearly understands American history and does a wonderful explaining how the American population shifted religiously from the Mayflower to the Constitutional Convention in 1787. I also was impressed by his description of how important dissenters were in Jefferson's, Madison's, Mason's victory for religious freedom and disestablishment. I highly recommend this work for anyone wanting to understand the dynamic of American religion and the desire for religious freedom/disestablishment in the American colonies and the start of the United States."
5447,Founding Fathers: Uncommon Heroes,Steven W. Allen,3.99,76,15,Tara,5,This is a delightful book! Came across it when I was looking for personal info on some of the founding fathers to teach my daughter for homeschool. I wanted to make them seem more real to her instead of just some person in a book. This book was something both she and I really enjoyed. It gave me a deeper understanding of the great men who fought for our nation on so many fronts. It has many personal experiences of these men. There are two versions--a regular version and an LDS version. The only difference is the LDS version has an appendix that outlines Washington's vision and the founding fathers' appearance in the St. George temple.
5449,"The Failure of the Founding Fathers: Jefferson, Marshall, and the Rise of Presidential Democracy",Bruce A. Ackerman,3.83,60,9,Bruce,5,"As one delves deeper into portions of American history what we were taught in El-Hi and college intro courses is revealed as, to be gentle, not the whole truth. In this work Prof. Ackerman discusses the issue of electoral processes designed by the 'founding fathers'. In the first instance, until 1933 there was a long lame duck session during which damage could be done making the incoming President's job that much harder and hardening the out-going administrations policies against possible change. The election of 1800 saw the presidential election thrown into the House of Representatives because of flaws in the electoral college process. This was combined with the stacking of the judicial system by the Federalists during their lame duck session. While Marbury v. Madison is now considered the case that established judicial review, the author argues it should be combined with Stuart v. Laird and not necessarily viewed as the basis for judicial review. In fact, Chief Justice Marshall should have recused himself from the case of Marbury v. Madison because he was the one that caused Marbury's problem and thus had a vested interest in the case. I found the work enlightening and further substantiated the idea that original intent can not be established with any real certainty. Especially if one takes into consideration the contexts during which the various documents and cases were developed."
5420,'Salem's Lot,Stephen King,3.99,249328,6348,Nataliya,5,"There was a time once when vampires were ruthless predators and not the misunderstood brooding and essentially harmless creatures. Ahhhh, good old scary times... Vampire stories have been around for a long time - after all, people love a good scare, and what is more terrifying than a monster showing up at night and sucking the life essence out of you? But leave it to Stephen King to turn the terror up a notch, add a whole new layer to it. How? Simply - using the winning formula that he continues to employ in the vast majority of his work. In addition to showing us the monsters of the night, he also brings into the picture the monsters and the darkness that are already with us, that live in the deep dark recesses of everyone's soul. """"The town knew about darkness.""""The town has its secrets, and keeps them well.""""The town cares for devil's work no more than it cares for God's or man's. It knew darkness. And darkness was enough.""The eponymous 'Salem's Lot is a small town in Maine, and it is not a stranger to secrets and darkness. It's quaint and pastoral on the surface, but once you look deeper you are bound to discover what lurks behind its respectable surface. And trust me, that's the discoveries that you can easily go without for the darkness of the human soul as presented by Stephen King beats everything that any monster or boogeyman can ever send your way. The small town of 'Salem's Lot can boast your usual lies, bullying, corruption, and prejudice - and spices it up with well-hidden child abuse, violence, and murders. Not so quaint, is it? It is this portrayal of everyday people's secrets, of the towns being almost like living breathing organisms that is one of the big reasons why I am a huge fan of Stephen King's works.From the very first pages of the novel we know that some terrible fate made 'Salem's Lot a ghost town with apparently only a couple of survivors. It doesn't take the reader long to realize, as we go back in time to see how the events unfolded, that the mysterious menacing Marsten House welcomed new evil that tends to lurk at night, floating past your (hopefully, tightly shut) windows. The story itself is rather straightforward, steadily moving along to its almost-conclusion that we have glimpsed in the first few pages, and we watch with bated breath as our bunch of good guys - Ben, Mark, Susan, Matt - are trying to take on the supernatural horror. Oh, and did I forget Father Callahan? (view spoiler)[A high-five from the Dark Tower universe, Father! (hide spoiler)]King is excellent with the plotting and the pacing (since this was only his second novel, he was still a stranger to writing larger-than-life brick-sized tomes). The story never lags, the suspense and sense of foreboding are rampant, and there are quite a few truly nailbiting situations. Nothing distracts the reader from the vampire story unfolding on the background of small-town horrors. There are no heavy-handed lessons to be learned, no deep morals to take out of the story - all we get is a thrilling and quite scary ride that may make you (a) sleep with a light on, and (b) be very careful about who you invite into your home. 5 stars."
6630,Word Power Made Easy,Norman  Lewis,4.37,5153,226,Daisy Holtel,5,"""A new word is not just another pattern of syllables with which to clutter you mind --A new word is a new idea to help you think, to help you understand the thoughts of others, to help you express your own thoughts, to help you live a richer intellectual life."" pg. 141I immensely enjoyed this book. It is a interesting read on its own, as well as a reference guide and a grammatical aid. It will sit next to my dictionary for a long time and will be used frequently. It is a perfect tool for someone looking to expand their lexicon, whether they be in their teens, twenties, thirties or older. It's perfect for logophiles and those who are striving to increase their literary education. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in words or their etymology."
6625,Playing Easy to Get (B.A.D. Agency #1.5; Vikings Underground #3; Immortals After Dark #1),Sherrilyn Kenyon,4.13,12281,354,Maya,4,"This review is only for The Warlord Wants Forever by Kresley Cole. I thought I'd enjoy the other two stories but with my limited book time, I really want to read books that suck me into them withing the first ten or so pages. I trully enjoyed this story. There was so much action and I adored Nikolai for his patience and his love for his bride. Now, as far as the bride goes, she was really crazy. There were moments in her POV where I thought that she's literally crazy, since the decisions and choices she made made no sense to me at all. Hence the crazy bride... If you're looking for a lot of heartfelt moments then this is not the book for you. But if you're looking for a fun action packed time with lots crazy lovers scenes, then this is a must read. And if you've read some of the Immortals after dark books, then you'll enjoy and understand the plot and setting even more. All I can say, Kresley did a good job with this one."
6932,What Color Is Your Parachute? 2007: A Practical Manual for Job-Hunters and Career-Changers,Richard N. Bolles,3.58,4193,157,Rachel Smalter Hall,4,"I picked up this book at a time in my life when I was like, ""ok, Rachel, it's time to figure some stuff out."" Along came Richard Bolles, like my own sweet little Grandpa giving me life advice. He actually had me doing all the cheesy exercises -- lists, graphs, venn-diagrams, even a flower chart for Pete's sake. And in the end, gosh darnit, I knew I was going to move back to the Midwest and become a librarian!FYI, this book does have some serious Christian overtones, but Grandpa Bolles is pretty low-key about it. It kind of makes you want to hug him, actually."
916,And a Hard Rain Fell,John Ketwig,4.12,573,51,Eric_W,5,"A very powerful book, especially for those of us who faced the draft and Vietnam in the late sixties. Ketwig was sent to Vietnam where he faced unimaginable horrors. He rails against the army, as did most draftees, who became the ""expendables"" while the ""lifers"" stayed in their air-conditioned bunkers behind the lines and collected medals for themselves. He ""volunteers"" for a second year to guarantee a billet in Thailand rather than return home because he doesn't think he can explain his 370 days in The Nam. While there he is recognized as a first-rate welder and is airlifted to somewhere classified -- obviously Laos, where our government assured us we were not -- to do some welds on an artillery battery that was shelling North Vietnam. The section after he returned home feels a little hurried and uneven, almost as if he couldn't wait to get it out. His data regarding the effects of Vietnam on his fellow soldiers are nothing short of frightening. The Air Force ""Ranch Hand"" report found that mortality in children of Vietnam vets before 28 days was three times that of the population unexposed to Agent Orange. But of course the report said they would not hesitate to use it again.Prophetically, while in Thailand he has dinner with a Japanese businessman(remember this is 1967) who says the new battlefield will be the marketplace. ""War is too expensive."" Obviously, we in America haven't been listening.  A must read"

4620,Geisha,Liza Dalby,3.99,3849,160,Robert Beveridge,3,"[Note: At the time I wrote this review, I had not yet read Golden's Memoirs of a Geisha. And I think I may be the only person in America who still hasn't.]Of course, it's now a full week after A&E aired _The Secret Life of Geisha_, a show nominally based on Dalby's 1983 account of her time in Kyoto as the only non-Japanese ever to train and serve as a geisha. But I kept reading anyway. The show's material came, for the most part, from the first four chapters of the book, which cover a good deal of history, and ignored the rest, which is more of a personal accounting of Dalby's time in Kyoto and her research in Tokyo and some of the smaller towns.Dalby's account is straightforward and precise, though I don't want to give the impression there's nothing here that would give the reader a sense of personal experience; far from it. Dalby, an anthropologist by nature as well as trade, has a knack for being able to translate emotion into recognizable speech and get it all down on paper in an easy-to-understand form.The end result is compulsively readable, half-journal and half-explication, of the widely misunderstood world of geisha and the cultural context to which it belongs-- as important to an understanding of what geisha are as a study of the women themselves. Dalby adresses the paradox that the women considered the most servile in Japan are also those with the most freedom, and by the time the book is finished it's no longer a paradox, really. Dalby takes the reader through the world of geisha, its history, its context, and most importantly the outside world's misconception of it. All is explained in such a way as to be easily absorbed, Not in the tradition of ""classic"" anthropological works at all. Which is a good thing.Absorbing, a quick read, new stuff to be learned, how can you go wrong?"
4630,To Have and Have Not,Ernest Hemingway,3.57,19291,1121,Will Byrnes,3,"This is not at all the Nazi romp of Bogie and Bacall fame. There might be some external similarities, but they seem fleeting. If you put your lips together to whistle here, the likelihood would be that it would be to warn someone that the police were coming. Life can be tough in The Conch Republic. Harry Morgan is a hard man in a hard time. He owns and operates his own fishing boat, out of Key West, catering to those who Have and want an ocean-going adventure. When Harry is stiffed out of almost three weeks of costs by a boorish client, he immediately becomes a Have Not, is faced with some tough choices, and agrees to transport some illegal Chinese immigrants in from Cuba, a mere 90 miles away. He will go on to smuggle more materials and people over the course of the story.Desperation is a frequent visitor on these remote shores. Harry is far from alone in feeling the impact of the Depression. One shipmate is a drunk who has seen the last of his good days. A sometimes hire is desperately trying to catch a job anywhere, just to feed his family. The illegals Harry transports are as desperate as working class illegals often are. Even one of the women here is shown in some detail contemplating her grim prospects after her husband has died. One group with whom Harry has dealings is Cuban revolutionaries. Harry, echoing Hemingway, offers a bit of support for their desires, their ideals, but faced with the reality of their actions, he sees beneath the plating to something a bit less glittery. There are crooks aplenty afloat here, whether a corrupt lawyer, a murderous coyote, a tax cheat, a welcher, and the odd homicidal revolutionary. Come visit. The book has the feel of something that was thrown together, or at least done in jumps. Turns out that is indeed the case. The first chunk was originally published in Cosmopolitan Magazine in 1934 under the title “One Trip Across.” Part Two of the book first appears in Esquire, February 1936, as “The Tradesman’s Return.” The narration voice varies, from Harry’s to an omniscient narrator, to the voice of sundry others later in the book. This is not necessarily a problem, but does make things feel a bit disjointed. Contributing to this is that, while the travails of Harry Morgan occupy most of the novel, he vanishes for a considerable swath towards the end, and our focus turns to several have characters, only a few of whom we have met before. Hemingway offers us a look at the sorts of desperation these haves experience. A wealthy grain trader rues a decision made in greed some years back, as the feds circle. A ne’er do well trust fund kid is a kid no more, his holdings have been hit hard by the Wall Street crash and the sorts of banking criminality that have become far too familiar, so he has to do what he has to do to keep up at least the veneer of wealth. “The eternal jackpot. I’m playing a machine now that doesn’t give jackpots anymore. Only tonight I just happened to think about it. Usually I don’t think about it."" Harry had risked his life to provide for his family, but the haves seem at a loss when faced with a loss of workless income. the money on which it was not worth while for him to live was one hundred and seventy dollars more a month than the fisherman Albert Tracy had been supporting his family on… One particular wanderer in here is Richard Gordon, a character clearly intended as a Hemingway stand-in, a writer of renown in a troubled marriage, something Ernest knew a little something about. There is a local married lady who “collects writers as well as their books,” disdaining a husband who may be impotent. Overall, there is a dark caste here. Part of that is the times, the Depression, when it was tough to bask in the glow of much of anything. It makes sense that the characters Hemingway portrays reflect the struggles of the era. While he clearly has little sympathy for the haves, he hardly paints the have nots with halos. There is plenty of hardship, and plenty of corruption to go around. I have not read much Hemingway, so lack the sort of insights one might acquire from a broader and deeper reading of his work. Man testing his mettle vs the world is one we know about though and that is present in abundance here. Harry is screwed by the world so does what he has to do, which includes considerable physical risk. Others prostrate themselves in other ways to get what they need. Are they any less active in taking on the world? Or is it only that it is their methods that differ? Things do not work out all that great for Harry. Maybe there are better approaches to his problem. Then, maybe there are not, and the world just sucks. The world shown here certainly fits into the trope “Life’s a bitch and then you die. Have a nice day.” Is this great literature? I am open to being corrected and I did think more of it before getting down to actually writing, but I would say “nah.” Interesting certainly, bleak, but too much a Frankenstein beast, parts cadged together, however expertly, that make for a less than successful merger. To Read or Read Not? I would take the plunge. It might illuminate themes and other specifics in Hemingway's later works, while providing a dark look at a dark time. You never can tell when a dark time might come around. PS - it is impossible, even though the character Harry Morgan bears no physical resemblance to Bogart, to keep that voice and delivery out of one's head while reading this."

4782,Crecy 1346: Triumph of the Longbow,David Nicolle,3.61,23,2,Glyn,5,"This offers a clear and simple introduction to the complexity of the Hundred Years War.Nicolle, a noted military historian with a long history with Osprey Publishhng, does the honours here provided a lucid and easy to follow introduction before taking us through the invasion, the fighting at Caen and the French response to the humiliation of English troops ravaging their soil. For so well known a battle as Crecy, it may be surprising to learn that there remain significant areas of historical doubt. Wisely, given the limited page count available, Nicolle does not delve deeply into what the actual strategy Edward III was employing (raid or invasion?) was. That would take a far more in depth study to give due credit to it's importanceThe centrepoint is of course the battle and the destruction of the French nobility which he describes well Having already, as per the format detailed the armies and their make up, the account of them in action is highly satisfying.This like all this series is a brief inftroduction and inspires the reader to dig deeper."
2112,The Art of Nonfiction: A Guide for Writers and Readers,Ayn Rand,3.96,364,32,Jim,3,"The first part was interesting, but it was also repetitive due to the editing. As a series of lectures a couple of weeks apart, the redundancy was probably helpful. Unfortunately, the editor was a true believer & didn't want me to miss a single gem of her wisdom. (I wonder if her adherents ever see the irony in their deification of her? Probably not. LOL!) Many of her thoughts were obvious, since we seem to look for the same things in nonfiction. I owe a lot of that to her. I've always admired her writing, aside from her penchant for using $5 words where a nickle one would do. She's precise, if pedantic & breaks one of her own cardinal rules; keeping the subject simple & to the point. Of course, that's tough to do when she took on all nonfiction writing. It's a broad subject running from short essays to books. Various scopes require different approaches.I wouldn't recommend this to nonfiction readers. At best, it's just going to make the failings of any essay or book that much more glaring. I don't think it will help with understanding of nonfiction any better, although she does make some good points about syllogism & other forms of faulty logic (or sleight of hand) that are used by so many snake oil salesmen. Still, if you didn't spot them before or are a believer in their particular medicine, I doubt this would change your mind. I didn't find anything new, she just codified them a bit better.Nonfiction writers of all sorts would get a lot out of this, I believe. Rand was certainly a remarkable speaker & writer. Her logic is profound & intricate, even if it does reach too far beyond the human condition. Still, that's a good thing in nonfiction writing.I was on the fence whether to give this 3 or 4 stars. Since she's so precise, I'm knocking it back to 3 due to it not really being for readers."
10978,Collected Stories,William Faulkner,4.25,6617,150,Owen,3,"In my experience, one does not become a reader of William Faulkner so much as a student of William Faulkner. Reading his work is, well, a lot of work. I’m reminded of a person who is forced to attend an opera which is performed in a foreign language, in a historical setting, without the benefit of subtitles and the evening’s program. Faulkner’s art is similarly inaccessible, and I must admit that his stories initially irritated me in the same way a fat lady in a Viking costume, screeching on a stage in a foreign language, might annoy our novice opera-goer. To this day, I still read Faulkner with a pen and paper in hand, diagramming character relationships and the chronology of events as if I were a trying to an answer a question on the LSAT. More times that not, I find that I actually enjoy the second reading of his stories because I’m not so busy trying to figure such basic elements as who is speaking to whom.While Faulkner doesn’t write in Italian or German, he does like to make up his own English on occasion. Before you read his novels or Collected Stories, I recommend that you become familiar, if you aren’t already, with the words “anathema,” “apotheosis,” “sibilant,” and “effluvium.” He loves those. Also, please exercise extreme patience with his use of floating pronouns—that is, pronouns without apparent antecedents—especially in the opening pages of each story. It might take a few thousand words for you to discover the person whom “he” or “she” refers to, if you’re lucky. Finally, consider interjecting your own punctuation in sentences that last for more than a page or two. Remember that rule about limiting a sentence to one or two ideas? Neither does Faulkner. Part of the fun about Faulkner, and I’m not kidding, is figuring out what the hell is happening in the story; it’s seldom obvious. He creates this challenge both purposely and unintentionally. His stream-of-consciousness and nonlinear plotlines are, of course, intentional mystical effects. But his lack of dialogue attribution and his inability to visually orient a scene tend to nonplus the reader. Consider the opening of “The Leg.”The boat—it was a yawl boat with a patched weathered sail—made two reaches below us while I sat with the sculls poised, watching her over my shoulder, and George clung to the pile, spouting Milton at Everbe Corinthia. When it made the final tack I looked back at George. But he was now but well into Comus’ second speech, his crooked face raised, and the afternoon bright on his close ruddy head.	“Give way, George,” I said. But he held us stationary at the pile, his glazed hat lifted, spouting his fine and cadenced folly as though the lock, the Thames, time and all, belonged to him, while Sabrina (or Hebe or Chloe or whatever name he happened to be calling Corinthia at the time) with her dairy-maid’s complexion and her hair like mead poured in sunlight stood above us in one endless succession of neat print dresses, her hand on the lever and one eye on George and the other on the yawl, saying “Yes, milord” dutifully whenever George paused for a breath. 	The yawl luffed and stood away; the helmsman shouted for the lock.	“Let go, George,” I said. But he clung to the pile in his fine and incongruous oblivion.  It goes without saying, then, that enjoying Faulkner isn’t a passive activity, at least not on the first reading (or diagramming). Before tackling his Collected Stories (a nine-hundred-page volume of veritable code) you should be forewarned that all of his novels, except one, were out of print until he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1949. Such irony underscores the premise that most people don’t read Faulkner so much as they study and appreciate him. Or perhaps they study him before they read him. I know I did. I didn’t truly enjoy Faulkner until I took a graduate class in which we slowly digested five of his novels: The Sound and The Fury (1929); As I Lay Dying (1930), Light in August (1932); Absalom, Absalom (1936); and Go Down Moses (1942).Collected Stories is comprised of forty-two short stories. In today’s publishing world, I dare say more than half of these short stories wouldn’t have made the final cut. Some of them, such as “A Justice,” “Red Leaves,” and “A Courtship,” might have worked better parceled together as a novella, since they focus on the same characters and story. Others, quite simply, are poorly crafted with unrealistic dialogue (in the sense that it replicates Fraulkner’s southern gothic narrative style and not how people speak) and too many characters, nameless and otherwise, for the medium of a short story, if not a novel. It’s like trying to conduct Mahler’s 8th Symphony in a public restroom. For example, his story “Fox Hunt” has no central character, yet there are several ancillary figures playing counterpoint to this nothingness, including “the old dame,” “the boy,” “the white man,” the youth,” the older man,” “the woman,” the man,” the man at the bay.” My God, Faulkner, give me somebody I can care about.Yet there are stories that are exceptionally well done, too. And while I don’t think any modern reader with a cable and internet subscription would attempt this entire volume without either 1) Having a gun at his head, or 2) an English paper due, I suspect that many of these stories, if anthologized or reduced to a compendium, might win Faulkner a few converts. I can safely recommend eleven of these stories: 1) “A Rose for Emily,” 2) “Dry September,” 3) “Victory,” 4) “The Evening Sun” 5) “Dr. Martino” 6) “Artist at Home,” 7) “The Brooch” 8) “Golden Land” 9) “Crevasse,” 10) “Two Soldiers,” and 11) “Barn Burning.” Contrary to popular thought, not all of Faulkner’s stories are set in the deep South. Of this collection, one is actually set in Beverly Hills and several others are set in Europe during the World War I era. What makes the above mentioned stories exceptional? What, in other words, allows them to overcome the dead weight of more than half of this volume to win the National Book Award? For one, Faulkner illuminates the psychological and moral depth and the emotional and intellectual complexity of many people who were previously stereotyped and marginalized, such as African Americans and Native Americans, if not southerners in general, be they poor or wealthy. That’s an award-winning service to America in and of itself. Secondly, Faulkner’s a damn good story-teller when he doesn’t let his writing get in the way. He reminds me of so many tragic heroes who have such outstanding strengths and weaknesses that the effect is nearly bipolar, like going on a trip with Dr. Jekyll—Mr. Hyde as your guide. Consequently, I both love and hate Faulkner, depending on whether the genius can hold the monster at bay. Sometimes the reader is mesmerized with phrases such as “old women dropsical with good living” or “the iron silence of winter.” At other times he pulls along so many adjectives and clauses that the meaning of his run-on sentence eventually derails whenever the plot takes a sharp turn. For example: “But the man did not seem to notice this, so they soon were talking in undertone, watching with bright, alert, curious eyes the stiff, incongruous figure leaning a little forward on the stick, looking out a foul window beyond which there was nothing to see save an occasional shattered road and man-high stump of shattered tree breaking small patches of tilled land whorled with apparent unreason about island of earth indicated by low signboards painted red, the islands inscrutable, desolate above the destruction which they wombed.” And that’s one of the small ones. Since some of Faulkner’s sentences run the length of a short story, I’m tempted to generalize that his rococo, serpentine style is more of a liability in the short story medium than in long fiction. I certainly enjoy his novels more than his short stories. Overall, Collected Stories has many gems, but you’ll have to dig for them. I think you’ll enjoy the story about Emily Griersen, a pitiful anachronism in the New South. You’ll like the irony found in “Victory,” and the genteel evil of “Dry September.” You’ll fear Jesus, a man with a razor, in “The Evening Sun,” and marvel at the psychological grip of physically frail characters such as Dr. Martino and Mrs. Boyd. Finally, you’ll be touched by the bond of brothers in “Two Soldiers” as well as the moral dilemma faced by a young boy in “Barn Burning.”"

10962,Blitz Cat,Robert Westall,3.91,764,82,Luís C.,4,"Lord Gort is an ordinary cat: she has no magic powers and rarely does anything more than what other cats can do. When her master leaves home to fight the Germans in World War II Lord Gort sets out to track him down. In the course of her travels the black cat is befriended by a lonely volunteer in the Observer Corps, a maverick sergeant, an elderly carter and a young war widow. Adopted by the rear gunner of a bomber plane, Lord Gort flies on numerous missions over enemy territory. After many successful flights, the intrepid feline's luck runs out; she and the rear gunner are forced to bail out over occupied France. With the help of the Spanish and French resistance movements the man and the cat return to England, where Lord Gort is reunited with her master. Each of these glimpses of men and women in wartime is as perfect as a pearl; Lord Gort's journey is the single black thread on which the precious beads are strung."
10974,As I Lay Dying,William Faulkner,3.72,111884,5606,AmyAmy,1,"I know you're ""supposed to"" love this book because it's Faulker, but I HATED IT! I know you're ""cool"" and ""intelligent"" if you read Faulkner, but I can't stand him. Sorry, I don't know what he's talking about (and at the risk of sounding immodest, I am bright). I DON'T think it's cool and ""hip"" to write in a confusing manner, and I don't try to impress others by liking ambiguity. I had my fill in college with snobs who pretended to like this stuff. Sorry I sound harsh here (I'm really a nice person), but YUK!"
10977,"Absalom, Absalom!",William Faulkner,3.96,32665,1642,Jeffrey Keeten,5," The picture above was used on the first edition dust jacket published in 1936 by Random House. It is the image I had in my mind of Sutpen's Hundred the plantation built by Thomas Sutpen. The hundred stands for a 100 square miles, the geographic size of the plantation. 100 square miles of land is equivalent to 64,000 acres. In other words it is a BIG PLACE. The gist of all this is that Thomas Sutpen built himself an empire. These plantations were so large that it required an unbelievable amount of human labor to keep them productive. Mechanical invention had not advanced enough to provide the machines that the plantation owners needed to work such a large tract of land. When you own more land than you can work and there is not a labor pool available to sustain your industry...what do you do? Well, we know what they did, but what should they have done? Around 1800 when cotton became king is when the demand for slaves escalated exponentially. The potato famine in Ireland happened in 1845 which brought thousands of displaced Irish to the United States, but this wave of immigration came too late to keep the South from becoming too economically dependent on slavery. Now I'm not advocating turning the Irish immigrants or the Chinese immigrants who followed into slaves, but wouldn't it have been a better solution for our history if those plantation owners had adopted the flawed, but still better than slavery, system of tenant farmers? Eventually technology would have caught up with the needs of large land owners which would have freed up the tenement farmers for the industrial work that made the North so strong. Maybe the availability of that labor pool would have encouraged manufacturing in the South. Some of the better tenement farmers would have become land owners themselves as plantations fell out of the hands of Southern aristocratic families due to the untimely death of a patriarch or because of mismanagement. Not a perfect world, but a better world and maybe, just maybe we would have avoided a costly Civil War for which the South to this day has never fully recovered. But then would Southern literature be the same? I have a grudging respect for Thomas Sutpen. As a boy he was asked to deliver a message to a wealthy plantation owner in Virginia. He watched the plantation owner lying in a hammock with his shoes off while a slave fanned him. Thomas was asked to go to the backdoor to deliver his message. He will never forget the slight. He lays awake at night thinking about what he can do about it. He does a stint in the West Indies and comes back to the United States, specifically Mississippi, with blacks speaking a strange language. ""He wasn't even a gentleman. He came here with a horse and two pistols and a name which nobody ever heard before, knew for certain was his own anymore than the horse was his own or even the pistols, seeking some place to hide himself. Quentin Compson is the thread that sews the plot together. As Rosie Coldfield and his father and a host of other people tell him stories about Yoknapatawpha County his head becomes filled with a convoluted history of his birthplace. ""Quentin had grown up with that; the mere names were interchangeable and almost myriad. His childhood was full of them; his very body was an empty hall echoing with sonorous defeated names; he was a being, an entity, he was a commonwealth."" Quentin spends more time with Rosie Coldfield than he really wants to, but she has memories that he needs to hear to fill in the gaps of the story in his head. ""Quentin....sitting in the buggy beside the implacable doll-sized old woman clutching her cotton umbrella, smelling the heat-distilled old woman=flesh, the heat-distilled camphor in the old fold-creases of the shawl, feeling exactly like an electric bulb blood and skin since the buggy disturbed not enough air to cool him with motion, created not enough motion within him to make his skin sweat.""The families who have lived in this county in Mississippi for generations are also the same people who regarded this new comer, Thomas Sutpen, with bemusement. When he successfully rooked a drunken Indian out of some land they clucked about that, but then as he continued to gain influence and wealth, building a comfortable living out of nothing; they started to worry. This opportunity had been there for them their whole lives, but it took a man with daring from outside the county to see the potential (or have the immorality to make it happen). He took a wife descended from a good family and the community showed their disapproval by not showing up to the wedding. Undaunted, barely noticing that the community had turned against him, Thomas Sutpen forged forward siring a son and a daughter and building the life for himself he had coveted as a boy in Virginia. The Civil War happens. Almost every able man is called up to serve. Thomas's son Henry is away from school and has become friends with Charles Bon who because of the encouragement of his mother has, at the advanced age of 28, decided to go back to school. He meets up with Henry and as the plot advances we find out that Charles Bon is Henry's half brother. Charles becomes engaged to Henry's sister Judith and of course she is also his half sister. As you might expect this causes much consternation in the family. I really didn't think that Charles loved Judith. ""It was not Judith who was the object of Bon's love or of Henry's solicitude. She was just the blank shape, the empty vessel in which each of them strove to preserve, not the illusion of himself nor his illusion of the other but what each conceived the other to believe him to be-the man and the youth, seducer and seduced who had known one another, seduced and been seduced, victimised in turn each by the other, conquerer vanquished by his own strength, vanquished conquering by his own weakness."" I think he saw Judith as the only way of achieving his own birthright. (view spoiler)[Henry kills Charles to keep him from marrying Judith even though he really loved him...well...like a brother. (hide spoiler)]The story is much larger than what I've touched on here. The book is riddled with incredible passages that would balloon this review up to megalithic proportions if I were to share them all with you. The layers of the story are frustrating and magnificent. I equate this book to going to a family reunion and spending time with a great aunt, an uncle, and a grandparent and asking them each the same question. The story is told with lots of repetitiousness because the narrators know a lot of the same information; and yet, from each storyteller is gleaned a few more nuggets because each person who is solicited for the story has a unique perspective and is in possession of different pieces of the life puzzle.I had moments where I wanted to deconstruct this story, strain out all the redundant information and write this story out in a linear fashion, but then it wouldn't be a masterpiece. It would just be another book telling a story about a slice of Southern history. By writing this book, this way, Faulkner not only preserved a piece of Southern history, but also preserved the tradition of Southern oral storytelling. I found that I read this book best late at night after my family was in bed and the only sound that I could hear were the goldfish coming up for air in our fish tank. I would always begin reading intending to only read a chapter, but once I landed in Jefferson, Mississippi I was soon caught up in the intricacies of the writer's web. I found myself reading chapter after chapter as if Faulkner's hand was giving me a gentle push to continue. ""Well, Kernel, they kilt us but they aint whupped us yit air they?""I know this book is difficult, but my suggestion is to find a quiet place, while reading this book, so that you can achieve almost a zen like focus. If you can relax enough you might find yourself sitting on the porch with Quentin and hearing the Southern cadences of the voices of the people narrating this tale. Sometimes we all just need to let people tell us a story. Bonus points to those that can actually smell the ""wistaria"".

10064,Rosshalde,Hermann Hesse,3.7,3122,177,Lisa,5,"Family - greatest gift or curse?Creative life - long suffering or fulfillment?Raising the questions of humanity in the microcosm of a single family, Hesse creates a painful, yet beautiful picture of the balance between liberty and suffocation, between creativity and middle class life.Without taking sides with any of his main characters, he shows their incompatibility and their power to hurt each other for being different from each other and for not living up to each other's dreams. The plot is simple and straightforward. A famous artist, at the height of his creative power, lives as a recluse with his estranged wife in a beautiful country house, Rosshalde, and their sole connection is the youngest son, over whose love and affection they fight jealously. The destructive dynamics are chilling, and scarily realistic. A child, a token of love and affection, reduced to an instrument to exert power over another person. An unhealthy competition with a young and impressionable human heart as a prize. The reader realises early on that there can be no winners in such a contest. Are children loved for their own sake, or for being images or copies of their parents? Most people would happily say the first, while acting according to the second scenario. Hesse brilliantly outlines the difficulties of family patterns without sparing his main characters.Only when tragedy strikes they are able to break the spell of mutual pain, and move on to try to start a new life. The artist, being more focused on future projects than on past experience, feels relief, while his wife resigns herself to the bitterness of failed middle class aspirations - thus illustrating the confining role of a wife and mother in a traditional family set up. Her remaining son is the only consolation.Failure of middle class marriage, seen through the lens of the specific needs of an enthusiastic and egotistical artist, beautifully described in Hesse's dry and compassionate prose - a little gem!Highly recommended!"
10081,Mary Queen of Scots and Her Hopeless Husbands,Margaret Simpson,3.68,118,14,Kimothy,4,"I have always had an interest in the English and Scottish monarchy, especially with the Tudors, the Tudor court and their relations. Mary Queen of Scots was indeed a sad queen, a naive woman used for other's personal gains; a woman who made many bad decisions that ultimately led to her demise.Usually, when reading a history book the text is too long and too informative for me to take in. But with these Dead Famous books, the history is written in bite sized chunks, and with a humourful flair. They also make learning FUN. The illustrations and captions are also witty, funny and bare resemblance to the people they're based on.Despite the series being aimed at children/teens, I nevertheless found this book to be well written and enjoyable. I'll be looking out for others in the series."
16720,As She Climbed Across the Table,Jonathan Lethem,3.67,4482,417,Violet wells,4,"Lethem’s penchant is always for the dysfunctional, for characters who have at least one screw loose and this is no different. Here he chooses academia to dramatise his vision of our dysfunctional world. Probably no one will ever write a better and more hilarious spoof of academia than Pale Fire but As She Climbed Across the Table certainly has its moments. It’s one of those novels that is almost entirely generated by one idea. The idea is what if a physics department created a portal into another universe? This portal, known as Lack, is seemingly endowed with intelligence, rather like a cash machine in that it will reject anything put into it that it doesn’t like. It accepts all manner of things, a pomegranate, a pair of socks, the campus cat but rejects most other things. Alice, the girlfriend of the narrator, and a particles physicist becomes convinced Lack has personality and a consuming crush on her part begins. Alice has found her wonderland. The novel is narrated by Philip, a professor of anthropology (the fact he isn’t a scientist means the science in the novel is articulated in layman’s terms and so very easy on the eye and brain). Philip and Alice enjoy a healthy relationship before Lack arrives. But once Lack is in the picture everything starts coming apart. As we all know any lack can consume light matter and turn it dark. Lack will become Philip’s arch-rival and a direct confrontation becomes inevitable. For such an inventive and clever book it’s very easy to read. Maybe the whimsy, the romantic comedy ultimately triumphs over deeper messages and the characters are sometimes close to pantomime figures but it’s a hugely enjoyable and thought provoking read with genuine laugh out loud moments.

16761,"Perry Mason: Seven Complete Novels -- The Case of: The Foot-Loose Doll, The Glamorous   Ghost, The Long-Legged Models, The Lucky Loser, The Screaming Woman, The Terrified Typist, and The Waylaid Wolf",Erle Stanley Gardner,4.03,71,5,Janet,3,"Agatha Christie, Erle Stanely Gardner, is not. He does, however, grow on one. My favorite part of each of these seven Perry Mason novels lies (truth, actually) at the beginning with the credits and dedication. Mr. Gardner knew quite a few interesting Texans in the crime and medical business whom he honored thusly. The end of the seven mysteries proved much better than the start, yet increasingly I found myself hoping Perry would ask Della to marry him. I know they’d live happily ever after. But Mr. Mason never gave it a thought. Likely, when he reached 50, he married the new attractive secretary leaving his (very) personal assistant, Miss Della Street, out on the corner after 30 years of faithfulness. I hope not, but now I’m jumping past the mysteries of the book into the romantic mysteries of human lives, even fictional ones."
16759,Twister,Michael Crichton,3.6,1516,35,Melissa ,3,"I am addicted to watching movies as I am in reading books. The pleasure is doubled when a book I've read is adapted to a movie. In this case the movie is really as good as the book, for it IS the screenplay so it did not at all vary. This version is the original screenplay of the movie Twister. Having read this before watching the film, it confirms that a person's imagination truly knows no bounds. Not to downgrade the intensity of the movie scenes but the events seem to be wilder in my mind than in the big screen. Truly, reading is one of the best activities to stimulate your imagination."
16762,The Case of the Stuttering Bishop,Erle Stanley Gardner,3.81,915,41,Evgeny,3,"A bishop came to Perry Mason for a consultation. He was extremely vague, but the general idea was that he was trying to help correcting an injustice happened some twenty years ago. A woman seemed to hit somebody while driving intoxicated (they really did not take the whole DUI thing seriously in the very beginning of the twentieth century). The Big Money was involved and the woman was forced to flee. Having given this tiny bit of information the bishop departed to disappear practically without a trace. Perry Mason now had several problems. The minor one was what to do with the information he had. The biggest one was the doubts about whether the bishop was a genuine article. As everybody knows there are some jobs that require from a person to be able to speak perfectly without any big accent and speech impediment. Ask yourself, when was the last time you saw a politician with speech problems? Never, that is when. Bishops obviously belong to the same category. This particular one stuttered. Was he really a bishop? Mason was completely hooked on the mystery.Please to not read the description of the book as for some unknown reason it talks about the middle part of the book without bothering to explain the beginning. Fear not, I just took care of the beginning in the paragraph above. I usually give 4 stars to a Perry Mason mystery, but this time I rated it lower. The reason for this: I was able to figure out the identity of the villain way before Mason which almost never happens with these mysteries being very complicated. This time I was disappointed in him. There were still a lot of complicated details I overlooked, so the book is not hopeless by any means, just not quite as good as the others."
16764,The Case of the Deadly Toy,Erle Stanley Gardner,3.78,451,30,Tony,4,"THE CASE OF THE DEADLY TOY. (1958). Erle Stanley Gardner. ***1/2.This novel, in a slightly abridged form, was originally published in serial form in “The Saturday Evening Post,” under the title, “The Greedy Grandpa.” Perry Mason picks up a client, a woman, who is trying to protect her seven-year-old son from being taken from her by his biological father – her ex husband. The ex is wealthy and not the nicest person you’d want to meet. The situation soon escalates to new heights when Daddy is, apparently, shot by the son and killed. It seems that the son liked to play with guns and was allowed to do so, under the enforced condition that they were unloaded. The situation becomes more and more confused as the ex-husband’s father comes into the picture. He is also a strong-willed individual and wants his grandson under his roof as the only living member of the family line. Perry is faced with several problems in this case, the biggest being the protection of the young son from being branded as the murderer of his father. This case was well put-together and moved along nicely. Stout managed to cover all the bases in this one without leaving the reader wondering what all happened."
16767,The Case of the Half-Wakened Wife,Erle Stanley Gardner,3.84,469,26,Evgeny,3,"It all started with a complicated (from legal point of view) real estate problem. I will not bore you with the details - more on this later - so sufficient to say a woman owned an island she wanted to sell to a millionaire, but the problem arose which prevented a sale. We all had to sell an island or two in our lives, so the situation is nothing out of the ordinary. Perry Mason was hired by the seller to untangle the legal Gordian knot. He quickly stumbled upon a freshly dead body and a person to defend against a murder charge - a completely unexpected person I might add. A very complicated mystery follows. This is the first book of the series I rated lower than my usual 4 stars. There are two reasons for this. First of all I could not care less about real estate laws of the US during the WWII. Their discussion were fairly long and this was the first instance for me when Gardner failed to make any law sound exciting: too long.Second, there was a scene in the middle of the book when I could not help feeling the author did everything in his power and beyond to avoid reaching its conclusion. Considering the conclusion was supposed to be very exciting the never-ending dialog before it became really old really fast. On the positive side Parry Mason got to taste his own medicine succumbing to a trap he always accuses the prosecution of falling into. I cannot be more specific here to avoid spoilers. As I mentioned the mystery was quite complicated, but this is something I came to expect from Gardner. So the novel is good, but not up to the usual standards of the series. P.S. Writing this review reminded me of my good friend Sarah. Sell your godforsaken island already!!!"
16249,Angry Housewives Eating Bon Bons,Lorna Landvik,3.78,30635,2978,Jenness,5,"the title of this book had thrown me off as just fluff untill it was recommended to me by my daughter. And she was right I loved it. Perhaps it is because the 4 women in the club loved and struggled through the same time periods I did. I was so envious of the closeness of these friends and how their friendship endured for over 30 years. Their choice of books for the bookclub were varied and interesting. How much fun would it be to start an angry housewives spin off book club and read the same books Faith, Merit, Slip and Audrey read. Like some of the other reviewers I too am a sucker for books about friendships and how much those friendships can mean in terms of love and support through difficult times. I would recommend this especially to women over 50. They can certainly relate to women's roles in the 60's and 70's as I did. I always hate to see a book I really enjoy end, because I ask the question ""What happens next?"". There is still a lot of stories that could develop from this wonderful beginning-especially about the next generation of these ""housewives""."
16763,The Case of the Glamorous Ghost (Perry Mason),Erle Stanley Gardner,3.84,560,37,Evgeny,4,"""If there's something strange in your neighborhood, who you gonna call? Perry Mason!""This is not the exact quote, but it is highly appropriate nonetheless. Perry Mason, Della Street, and Paul Drake play the Ghostbusters long before the original movie was filmed. First it was a newspaper story that caught Parry Mason's attention. Apparently the evening before a couple was was having a romantic evening in the secluded spot; nothing inappropriate as the book was published in 1955. Suddenly a dancing woman appeared wearing a see-through coat and almost nothing else looking almost like a ghost, a glamorous ghost. It was implicitly given to understand that the ghostly woman looked much better than the one with her boyfriend - not to mention the advantage in clothing (of the absence of such to be exact). The boyfriend seemed to forget about his company, so the woman was forced to grab the first heavy object under her hand and give a chase to the so-called ghost. She failed, but later the police found a woman still dressed the same way suffering from amnesia. No sooner Mason finished reading as a half-sister of the yesterday's ghost came asking to protect her relative from whatever trouble she as as it seems the woman whose name was Eleanor Corbin always played an amnesia card when she was in trouble. This time according to some signs the trouble had to be of the epic proportions. It turns out quite soon ""epic"" had not even begin to describe the said troubles. In some of the Mason's cases (usually the best ones) it is impossible to understand what is going on. Things happen and they seem to be related as they happen to the same group of people, but how exactly they are related and that is their purpose are completely unclear. This case belongs to the same category. Things became clearer fairly fast: right in the second half. Still some confusion is always welcome in a good mystery - and this series almost never fails to be good. The rating is the usual 4 stars. P.S. Something finally occurs to me, after only 47 initial books of the series. If you are a DA and Perry Mason is nearby is would be a great idea to go to the latter and ask if your next suspect is Mason's client. If so start looking for another suspect right away and avoid future embarrassment. This is a good advice even if I was quite slow to come up with it."
16760,"El mundo perdido (Parque Jurásico, #2)",Michael Crichton,3.73,93929,2491,Chelsea,5,"I find a lot of people discuss the ""resurrection"" of Ian Malcolm in their reviews, and I'd like to throw in my two cents. It's true, Malcolm is mentioned as dead at the end of Jurassic Park. To be exact, Muldoon is telling Grant what's happened to everyone else as they're flying away in the helicopter:""What about Malcolm?"" Grant said. Muldoon shook his head.The epilogue mentions the Costa Rican government not permitting the burial of John Hammond or Ian Malcolm (amongst a list of other ways they dragged their feet and covered things up). But that's it.My point is this: it's not as if Crichton tricked us by delivering a long death scene where Ian Malcolm said his last goodbyes and made some final point about evolution and chaos theory - then got lazy and just reintroduced Malcolm into the next book. Malcolm's ""death"" in JP was not seen, and only vaguely mentioned (unlike every other major character who died in the book). Also, the explanation given in The Lost World as to why the others thought he was dead was completely plausible - he was simply so close to death that he was left for dead.I'll get off of my soapbox now. For me, The Lost World was a satisfying and exciting read. I think I read it in about a day and a half the first time, and I've re-read it a few times since."
16897,The Portable Thoreau,Henry David Thoreau,4.15,645,32,Jenna Los,4,"I had never read anything by Thoreau before this book. I had, of course, heard of him, but I never had the desire to read what I perceived would be a long, dull book about the woods. I love nature, but I love being in nature not (or so I thought) reading about it. That said, Thoreau pleasantly surprised me; I actually really enjoyed reading these selections. Walden isn’t merely hundreds of pages describing a flower or stream; Thoreau places a lot of philosophy in his work. He stresses individuality and discovering oneself by leaving the trappings of civilization and its material desires behind. I think he might even agree with me that you can’t be transformed by merely reading about Nature, but you have to actually go out and experience it for yourself.One of my favorite pieces was ""Walking"". His idea of a walk is no doubt a far cry from what we think of walking as today: ""If you are ready to leave father and mother, and brother and sister, and wife and child and friends, and never see them again – if you have paid your debts, and made your will, and settled all your affairs, and are a free man – then you are ready for a walk. (593)"" Thoreau would not approve of walking while talking on cell phones or listening to iPods; this detracts from truly engaging in the world around you. Of course, many of us are too anxiety-ridden to relax enough for a stroll; we use the mp3 players to drown out our own thoughts on purpose since allowing them to take hold tends to be overwhelming. And I think this fear of free thinking is what Thoreau was afraid would happen to a materialistic society? That we would become so preoccupied with working and making money to earn the things we think we need that nothing is ever enough and work is never done, that our workday follows us home and fogs our thoughts that we no longer see any of the world clearly.Do yourself a favor and read Thoreau."
16895,Collected Essays and Poems,Henry David Thoreau,4.13,263,9,David,4,"Of this collection I read Civil Disobedience, Walking, and a few of his poems. Of these, and of what I've read of Thoreau, I enjoyed Walking the most. Thoreau speaks about his thoughts and experiences he has while walking in the country and in the woods. He sees not only the physical, but the spiritual world better when he has been out among that which is natural.Here are some excerpts from Walking:""How near to good is what is wild!""""Life consists with wildness. The most alive is the wildest. Not yet subdued to man, its presence refreshes him. One who pressed forward incessantly and never rested from his labors who grew fast and made infinite demands on life, would always find himself in a new country or wilderness, and surrounded by the raw material of life.""""Hope and the future for me are not in lawns and cultivated fields, not in towns and cities, but in the impervious and quaking swamps.""""Above all, we cannot afford not to live in the present...Unless our philosophy hears the cock crow in every barn-yard within our horizon, it is belated...the merit of this bird’s strain is in its freedom from all plaintiveness. The singer can easily move us to tears or to laughter, but where is he who can excite in us a pure mourning joy?""[After describing a sunset] It was such a light as we could not have imagined a moment before, and the air also was so warm and serene that nothing was wanting to make a paradise of that meadow. When we reflected that this was not a solitary phenomenon, never to happen again, but that it would happen forever and ever an infinite number of evenings, and cheer and reassure the latest child that walked there, it was more glorious still.""...so we saunter [which comes from the phrase ""holy walker""] toward the Holy Land, till one day the sun shall shine more brightly than ever he has done, shall perchance shine into our minds and hearts, and light up our whole lives with a great awakening light, as warm and serene and golden as on a bank-side in autumn.""------------------------------In Civil Disobedience, what is important to Thoreau is the individual's ability to be an individual. To live a free life. He looks back in another essay to the free life of the Greeks, and the true humanity that is found in Greek poetry. He believes that there is a need to stand for principles, but using the government for that is the wrong venue. I think he would probably be classed with the libertarians today.Here are some excerpts from Civil Disobedience:If the injustice is part of the necessary friction of the machine of government, let it go, let it go: perchance it will wear smooth,--certainly the machine will wear out...Let your life be a counter friction to stop the machine. What I have to do is to see, at any rate, that I do not lend myself to the wrong which I condemn.""[Those in government] take too much time, and a man’s life will be gone. I have other affairs to attend to. I came into this world, not chiefly to make this a good place to live in, but to live in it, be it good or bad. A man has not everything to do, but something""""For it matters not how small the beginning may seem to be: what is once well done is done forever. But we love better to talk about it: that we say is our mission. Reform keeps many scores of newspapers in its service, but not one man.""""The rich man...is always sold to the institution which makes him rich. Absolutely speaking, the more money, the less virtue; for money comes between a man and his objects, and obtains them for him…thus his moral ground is taken from under his feet.""""It costs me less in every sense to incur the penalty of disobedience to the State, than it would to obey. I should feel as if I were worth less in that case...when an acorn and a chestnut fall side by side, the one does not remain inert to make way for the other, but both obey their own laws, and spring and grow and flourish as best they can, till one, perchance, overshadows and destroys the other. If a plant cannot live according to its nature, it dies; and so a man.""""[Those involved with government] speak of moving society, but have no resting-place without it…They are wont to forget that the world is not governed by policy and expediency…the [Politician] is always strong, original, and, above all, practical. Still his quality is not wisdom, but prudence. The lawyer’s truth is not Truth, but consistency, or a consistent expediency.""""...where is the legislator who has wisdom and practical talent enough to avail himself of the light which [the New Testament] sheds on the science of legislation?""""[Government] can have no pure right over my person and property but what I concede to it.""What is important to Thoreau is the individual's ability to be an individual. To live a free life. He looks back in another essay to the free life of the Greeks, and the true humanity that is found in Greek poetry. He believes that there is a need to stand for principles, but using the government for that is the wrong venue. I think he would probably be classed with the libertarians today."
16902,Walden,Henry David Thoreau,3.79,122180,3720,Riku Sayuj,5,"The first half is written by Thoreau, the accomplished philosopher and soars much above my humble powers of comprehension; the second half is written by Thoreau, the amateur naturalist and swims much below my capacity for interest. After reading about the influence the book had on Gandhi, I had attempted reading Walden many (roughly four) times before and each time had to give up before the tenth page due to the onrush of new ideas that enveloped me. I put away the book each time with lots of food for thought and always hoped to finish it one day. Now after finally finishing the book, while I was elated and elevated by the book, I just wish that Thoreau had stuck to telling about the affairs of men and their degraded ways of living and about his alternate views. Maybe even a detailed account of his days and how it affected him would have been fine but when he decided to write whole chapters about how to do bean cultivation and how to measure the depth of a pond with rudimentary methods and theorizing about the reason for the unusual depth of walden and about the habits of wild hens, sadly, I lost interest. I trudged through the last chapters and managed to finish it out of a sense of obligation built up over years of awe about the book. The concluding chapter, to an extent, rewarded me for my persistence and toil. In this final chapter, he comes back to the real purpose of the book: to drill home a simple idea - ""I learned this, at least, by my experiment; that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours. He will put some things behind, will pass an invisible boundary; new, universal, and more liberal laws will begin to establish themselves around and within him; or the old laws will be expanded, and interpreted in his favor in a more liberal sense, and he will live with the license of a higher order of beings.""This I think was the core philosophy of the book - if you pursue the ideal direction/vision you have of how your life should be, and not how convention dictates it should be, then you will find success and satisfaction on a scale unimaginable through those conventional routes or to those conventional minds.I will of course be re-reading the book at some point and thankfully I will know which parts to skip without any remorse."
16739,Blessings,Belva Plain,3.91,2365,39,Sue,4,"Jennie Rakowsky had a daughter out of wedlock as a young college student. Unwilling to consider abortion, she went to a home for unwed mothers, had the baby and immediately gave her up for adoption. She then moved forward with her life, putting this difficult time behind her. Now, almost 20 years later she is a successful lawyer and advocate of women's rights and is engaged to be married. Out of the blue she receives a phone call from an agency stating that her daughter would like very much to meet her. Jennie is horrified at this and states that she wants no part of the meeting. For one thing, she'd never shared this information with her fiance Jay and is convinced that if he found out about her past that their future together would be over. The remainder of the story is Jennie working through the emotions while also handling an environmental legal case that escalates towards violence. I really enjoyed this. The story line drew me in and I found myself pulling for the characters throughout."
16738,Tapestry,Belva Plain,3.92,1476,45,Donna,5,"Tapestry is carried into the 1920's and 30's, where once again we meet Paul Werner and his family. Paul is married to Marian; and now they are suffering a painful loss of the stillborn child and consequences that leaves Marian in a barren state, never to conceive again.Paul's aunt Hennie's husband, Dan, is put in jail for his reform ideas. Only a bootlegger, Donal Powers, can get Dan released. How this was done was kept hush hush.Paul travels to Europe on banking business and visits Germany where he has a cousin, Joachim, who is unable to forsee the upcoming doom of another war. He thinks all is well. Joachim is shot during a rally and has Paul take him to a female doctor, Ilse Hirschfeld. Paul becomes enthralled with her and they become lovers. There is just so very much to tell about all these characters and more from this book. It will keep you interested for hours to find the outcome of all of this. Some will be heartbreak and some will be wonderful.I hope you will enjoy the book as much as I have."

16372,"The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side (Miss Marple, #9)",Agatha Christie,3.89,23442,822,Brina,4,"There is nothing like staying up late on a summer evening reading a mystery to discover whodunit. Mysteries have long been one of my favorite genres to read. While I have a few contemporary series I do enjoy, there is no one who measures up to the queen of mystery writing, Agatha Christie. I am generally a fan of her Belgian detective Hercule Poirot, but I have recently discovered her other famous sleuth, Miss Jane Marple. In A Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side, Miss Marple is once again front and center as murders shake up life in her sleepy village. It is the post war era, and St Mary Mead has grown from a sleepy village to a modern town with a grocery store and upscale housing development. The taxi service has been sold, yet older residents still refer to as its old name Inch. Their is a new vicar and Miss Bantry has sold the prominent Gossington Hall to movie star Marina Gregg and her husband Jason Rudd. Yet, Miss Marple is still a prominent fixture in the village despite all of the changes around her. She is now an octogenarian and still lives in her home, but her nephews have provided her with a live in housekeeper. Her mind is still as sharp as a tack, and her physician teases her that her unraveling of murder cases is what she needs to remain healthy. In this case Agatha Christie addresses ageism is she has the housekeeper treating Miss Marple like a feeble invalid even should she remains sound in body and mind. One day she takes a walk in the new housing development on her daily exercises and encounters one Heather Badcock. Badcock reminds Miss Marple of an old acquaintance who is self-centered in a positive sort of way. The next day Marina Gregg throws a fete at Gossington Hall, and Badcock, who is a huge fan, attends. The evening ends in tragedy as Badcock is murdered. Just what the doctor ordered, Miss Marple is on the case. She declares that no one would want to murder a woman like Heather Badcock. Marina Gregg must have been the intended target, and Miss Marple sets about assisting the police in unraveling the mystery. Christie presents a large cast of characters each with many layers and backstories that have me guessing until the end. Marina Gregg's story is ripped from the headlines as she represents a prominent Hollywood star who has been married five times and seeks life in a small village like St Mary Mead to settle down. Her current husband Jason Rudd highly doubts that Gregg will ever settle down but he showers her with love none the less. Miss Marple reads magazines about the lifestyles of the rich and famous as part of her investigation. As always, she is a step ahead of both the local and Scotland Yard police who are still clueless as more deaths occur at Gossington Hall. Yet, Miss Marple reads people extremely well, and assists her nephew Inspector Braddock in cracking the case before its too late. Even though I thoroughly enjoy Hercule Poirot's use of little gray cells, I am enjoying Miss Marple more and more with each case. In a quaint village no one knows more about what goes on than women who make gossip into a sport, and no one hears more than Miss Marple. This makes her privy to most information in St Mary Mead and has her solving mysteries at an age when most people are happy to be sitting at home. I do like how Christie in her older age addresses the issue of age discrimination in her books. Just because one is old does not make one feeble minded, as Miss Marple proves by solving the case before the police do. It is always a treat to read Agatha Christie, and A Mirror Crack'd From Side to Side ended up being an enjoyable 3.75 stars."
16375,"Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit (Jeeves, #11)",P.G. Wodehouse,4.32,4894,286,Jason Koivu,4,"Another deeelightful romp in the Wodehouse world! Romp-tiddly-romp, I say, what?! What, what?!Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit, aka What Ho, Jeeves, is a bit different from others in the Wooster/Jeeves line in that it reads like a play. In my case, it listens like a play, because I ingested this audiobook-style. So, in place of Wodehouse's wonderful narration via Bertie's inner monologue, we get awkward exposition and strange soliloquy. Instead of a witty description of Jeeves' discontent over Bertie's ghastly upper-lip appendage, we hear the actor groaning and moaning in a most peevish manner, in a word: whinging. All the above sounds odd and irritating, and would be off-putting enough to make most listeners give it up. I'm not most readers when it comes to a Wooster and Jeeves novel, so I stuck it out, and boy am I glad I did! Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit turned out to be a cracking good read!It's no different than any of the other 101 books (or however many there are) on the dynamic duo in this series. Bertie's having a typically rough morning after a raucous night out when hell breaks out and rings his doorbell. One of his torturous aunts is in need, a former fiancee may or may not wish to marry him again, the significant other of this former fiancee wishes to wring Bertie's neck (or in this case, break his spine in upwards of a half dozen different locations), a minor heist is required of Bertie by his aunt, and Jeeves will save the day 9 times out of 10. It's a tried and true formula from which Wodehouse seldom varies. So why bother to keep coming back? One likes the well-known rerun and is grateful for the old trusty laugh when so needed. I often pick up a Wodehouse when I'm down or blue or in some other variation on the state of sadness. A dose from a reliable rib-tickler can get one out of a funk as well as an aspirin relieves a headache, and this book is an even more potent remedy for what ails you.NOTE: I'd like to make a further note, a sidebar if you will, regarding the audiobook. The performances were mostly top-notch. I attribute this to the use of about three actors who've voiced the Bertie character in other Wodehouse books. One played the main role, while the others supported. Fantastic casting!"
16396,"The Inimitable Jeeves (Jeeves, #2)",P.G. Wodehouse,4.26,14425,829,Pramod Nair,5,"“We Woosters do not lightly forget. At least, we do - some things - appointments, and people's birthdays, and letters to post, and all that - but not an absolutely bally insult like the above.” Absolutely hilarious! The adventures of Bertie Wooster and Jeeves are narrated by Wodehouse with his natural flair and brilliantly fun-filled manner. P.G. Wodehouse shows off his comic genius in this timeless funny classic.If you are feeling down then i would recommend a dose of Wodehouse, which will refresh you up and fill you with a glow of warmth for sure. And it is one reason why P.G. Wodehouse is one of my all time favorite and most read author."

He then discovers that he has learned much through his misfortunes and goes to tell the world about it.This story was an example for me, and while Alberic failed many times, he persevered and became a better man because of it. I am in the process of learning to accept my mistakes and while I might not be the best at something, to continue with it because I know that I will come out with an experience that will help me develop. We are all continually learning as we grow in this world, and we don't want to hinder our experience just because we may be afraid to try something new."
16371,"Mrs. McGinty's Dead (Hercule Poirot, #28)",Agatha Christie,3.81,13402,529,Carol. ,4,"Alas, Mrs. McGinty; we hardly knew you.Really. I mean that. She was a widow, a woman who cleaned houses and took in lodgers to make ends meet; had a niece whom she saw at holidays, and was perhaps a bit of a nosy parker; nothing extraordinary to fill the obituary. When Inspector Spence visits the retired Poirot, he shares his troubling concern that the man he arrested for murdering Mrs. McGinty, and who is now facing the death penalty, is not truly guilty. Yes, yes; the circumstantial evidence was damning, but James Bentley’s milquetoast personality seems so wrong for the deed. Could dear Poirot perhaps put his little grey cells to work? But the clues won’t be found in McGinty’s past; as Hercule Poirot points out “For, you see, Mon cher Spence, if Mrs. McGinty is just an ordinary charwoman–it is the murderer who must be extraordinary.” It is true; the murderer is a bit extraordinary. The plotting has an interesting premise, albeit perhaps hard to understand in the modern age. A second murder (because there always is one, isn’t there?) was unsurprising. Overall, the book reminded me more than a bit of A Murder Is Announced, so perhaps take a break between if you are on a Christie binge, or perhaps visit one of her more exotic locales in between.For once, Christie leads with Hercule instead of consulting him later, providing an enjoyable stroll down nostalgia lane. Poirot laments the loss of Hastings as a sounding board and audience, but since Poirot’s investigative strategy is to stir up the village, he ends up ‘confiding’ in a number of people. We are treated to Christie’s standard cast of the post-war English village: a penniless but connected couple with a shabby family manse, a overly dramatic woman who enjoys her own tales of woe, the dutiful but repressed daughter, a bold young woman emblematic of the new age, an insecure, unsmart woman attempting to climb the social ladder, a postmistress with a penchant for gossip. All standard in many Christies, along with the semi-invalid elderly woman and her playwright son, echoes of Marple’s nephew Raymond.“Mrs. Sweetiman imparted all this information with relish. She prided herself on being well informed. Mrs. Weatherby whose desire for knitting needles had perhaps been prompted by a desire to know what was going on, paid for her purchase.“Tone seems on the playful side, which self-referential remarks on writing, appreciation and performance. When Mrs. Oliver and her apples make an appearance, it becomes quite clear that Christie is taking an authorial aside to muse on readers who obstinately prefer troublesome characters and playwrights who take license with an author’s characters. “‘How do I know?’ said Mrs. Oliver crossly. ‘How do I know why I ever thought of the revolting man? I must have been mad!… Why all the idiotic mannerisms he’s got? These things just happen. You try something–and people seem to like it–and then you go on–and before you know where you are, you’ve got someone like that maddening Sven Hjerson tied to you for life.”Poor Dame Christie. She seems to have had at least a gastronomic sort of revenge on Poirot at least, by boarding him at the worst guest-house possible: ""I thought I would open a bottle of those raspberries I put up last summer. They seem to have a bit of mould on top but they say nowadays that that doesn't matter... --practically penicillin."" If it is any post-humous consolation, in my old age, I prefer Miss Marple to the conceited Poirot, but I enjoy them both. Mrs. McGinty's Dead is one worth adding to the library.Three and a half self-referential stars."
16395,Quick Service,P.G. Wodehouse,4.14,580,68,Greg Brozeit,5,"Reading P.G. Wodehouse is a lot like enjoying eiswein. Connoisseurs can easily merge their nuances into a reason for celebration; the uninitiated can’t. A vintage eiswein has a complex, syrupy taste and consistency. But for one who has no palette or appreciation of them, the differences may be lost. It’s all the same, they ask, “What’s the big fuss?” The same could be said about a Wodehouse novel or short story. For those not well-versed with Wodehouse’s geography, the differences between them are negligible; they blend together into repetitive themes.Within the Wodehouse universe, a meandering repetitive story line is not a bad thing. It is a source of comfort and anticipation. After all, we can be sure to encounter a country manor run by eccentric uncles and aunts, a sappy love story, an overbearing relative or guest, an American—maybe wealthy, maybe not—who tries to appropriate some of the gleam and cachet of British aristocracy, a butler, and a local inn which always seems to be the center of confusion and misunderstanding. They are problems to people who do not realize they have no real problems in their lives at all.The Wodehouse vineyard varietals include the better-known Jeeves and Wooster and Blandings Castle stories. One could also count, to a lesser extent, Mr. Mulliner’s storytelling, the eccentricities of Psmith and Ukridge, the antics of the bungling criminals Chimp Twist, Malloy and Dolly, the insanity of Lord Ickenham, the shallowness of the Drones Club members, and many other upper class English scenarios.When considering the products coming from the Wodehouse vineyards, Quick Service is unquestionably among its finest vintages. You’ll check out of your world for a short time, you’ll laugh, and, as with good wine, you will wonder about those you haven’t yet sampled."

16400,Money in the Bank (Collector's Wodehouse),P.G. Wodehouse,4.14,335,27,K.A. Laity,5,"It’s not Jeeves and Wooster, not Blandings and not Psmith, so one of those that tends to get neglected. A light crime caper with all of Wodehouse’s signature humour and a bit of romance although all is rocky to begin with as just about everybody ending up at the cozy country house have reasons to loathe and suspect each other. The delight is seeing how the characters dodge their enemies, forge uneasy alliances and fall in love against their will. And of course it will make you smile and laugh out loud. Some faves:‘I shall concentrate exclusively upon the work where I am convinced that my real talents lie. I shall write thrillers, and I shall do nothing but write thrillers, and if they come to me and plead with me to appear in the latest cause célèbre, I shall reply that I am sorry, but I cannot fit it in. You merely court disaster in these days of specialisation, if you dissipate your energies.’‘In the life of every man there come times when he wishes he were James Cagney, and one of these had come upon him now.’‘Chimp Twist was human, though most of his acquaintances would have liked to have this proved to them, and it is a human trait to keep on hoping, however sticky the outlook.’‘She spoke so quietly, so meekly, her whole air so like that of a good little girl remorseful for having been naughty, that a wiser and more experienced man than Lionel Green would have climbed the wall and pulled it up after him.’‘It had taken him some time to make the discovery, but he had suddenly become conscious that there was an oddness about this girl’s manner. She put him in mind of a bomb on the point of exploding, and it disturbed him.’‘It is the secret sorrow of authors that they too seldom come into direct contact with their public. Her publisher’s statement told Mrs Cork that two hundred and six splendid men and women had bought A Woman in the Wilds, but never till now had she stood face to face with anyone on the roll of honour.’‘Her views on her eccentric employee had come of late to resemble those entertained by King Henry the Second towards Thomas à Becket. The words “Will no one rid me of this turbulent butler?” seemed to be trembling on her lips.’"
16399,"Tales of St. Austin's (School Stories, #3)",P.G. Wodehouse,3.4,292,34,Scott,4," Long study of the classics had quickened his faculty for seeing sense in passages where there was none.Is there any sense in Wodehouse? Let’s hope not too much! How rare to find someone who can take you to cloud cuckoo land and let you flit around with the broadest smile possible stretched from ear to ear ... and do it again, and again, and again. Even though the Tales of St Austin’s (1903) are not the madcap masterpieces of Bertie & Jeeves, Psmith, or Blandings, they still pull the curtain back on Wodehouse’s sheer glee in writing a sentence. Is there any other author who puts so much snicker into his prose?Over the course of five years, I picked up Tales of St. Austin’s at least ten times before I finally settled into the book. The paper-thin plots and nearly indistinguishable characters (all ""fine, strapping specimens of sturdy young English manhood"") showed just enough personality to hold my interest. What hobbled me, though, was the lingo. All this schoolboy swotting, bucking up, and giving the beans had me perplexed. Just what is the difference between a beak and a bargees? Where is the crease and can someone please explain a leg before ... something or other? And how is it that the word rot can function as any part of speech? Too lazy in former days to look these words up in Websters, I’ve lately discovered a new world of meaning just a touch away in my iPod’s dictionary.Wodehouse first published the stories in a Boys Life sort of magazine. He set out to refine Young England, but with a Mephistophelean smirk. These are stories about how to break the rules, enjoy the experience, and accept the consequences. The moral, though not always foremost, is never hard to find: cheaters get ""touched up,"" effort is rewarded, justice in the end prevails, and the rotter gets his due ... most of the time. But they were also written to craft literary taste by subverting the idolized station of a Greco/Latin education and giving resounding thumbs up to humorists and adventure writers, and all the other writers whose stories don’t require notes.What fun, though, some day, to annotate a critical edition of Wodehouse’s early works and highlight his gems of timeless wisdom. I don’t believe anyone has ever charged Wodehouse with being the wellspring of a liberal education, but there are enough literary allusions, parodies, and references in a few chapters of these Tales to build a satisfactory reading list for a college entry exam. Within thirty pages Wodehouse bemoans Euripides and Livy, recommends Rider Haggard, Dicken’s Pickwick Papers, and James Payn, parodies Thucydides, Horace, and the Psalmist, and tweaks Hamlet and Isaiah for comic relief."
16401,The Luck of the Bodkins,P.G. Wodehouse,4.08,1352,101,Henry Avila,4,"A French farce with English reserve , ( best describes this saga ) well not too much... after all it was written by the great P.G. Wodehouse...

Troubles send our fragile hero to the Riviera, in Cannes, to calm his nerves in a resort hotel , even during the Depression the affluent need to relax.The adoring Bodkin is writing to his love a letter of his passion for her, but he is not the brightest bulb in the neighborhood, and tries to ask a fat man at a nearby table to help him with a spelling problem, turns out this is a Hollywood Mogul fighting with his pesky sister-in-law Mabel Spence, she has a ghastly message from scary Grayce...pardon me the rotund gentleman is called Ivor ""Ikey"" Llewellyn, a most unpleasant person to be around and the interruption causes a stormy reaction, to put it mildly...This episode permits the paranoid, Movie studio boss to have bad thoughts a plot by his young, former actress wife, Grayce , safely in Paris, to smuggle her pearl necklace by customs in New York without paying taxes... he is petrified, fears jail , could this moron be a spy for them?

16849,A Crackup at the Race Riots,Harmony Korine,3.84,757,62,Winter Branch,5,"For a couple of years this was my favorite book of all time. Even today I can't help but get excited when reading it.Harmony Korine's book has no flowing narrative. Instead this book is a collection of a bunch of seemingly random things. Such as strange lists:Titles of Books I Will Write:1. A Life WIthout Pigment5. Gentle Jesus and Drugs21. Diary of Anne Frank part 2Rumors4. Ray Bradbury had scoliosis12. G. G. Allin voted for Jimmy Carter18. Johnny Rotten collects baseball cards21. Tom Petty has a dirty fish tankThen there is the section of 11 different suicide notes (each one ending with a blank line for a signature). The different letters written by Tupac to his mother.He includes random poems, pieces of dialogues, notes added in handwriting, pictures, and more. Even though this book seems random and without direction, this book has many red threads of commonality running through it. In many ways it is like a companion piece to his film Gummo (for they both have that scattered feel). In the end the books is really a reflection of the American landscape. Korine is reacting to/remarking on many different aspects of our culture such as racism, homophobia, drugs, depression, celebrity obsession, satanism/religion, and ADD. His approach is different but perfectly appropriate given the subject matter. "
16844,"Christopher et son monde, 1929-1939",Christopher Isherwood,4.12,2265,129,Nigeyb,3,"Frank, and beautifully written, however I was less captivated than I'd expectedImmediately prior to reading ""Christopher and His Kind"" by Christopher Isherwood I read, and really enjoyed, ""Mr Norris Changes Trains”, so I was excited to find out more about Christopher Isherwood’s life during the 1930s.""Christopher and His Kind"" is an autobiographical account of Christopher Isherwood's life from 1929, when he left England to spend a week in Berlin and decided to stay there indefinitely, through to 1939, when he arrived in America. I hoped ""Christopher and His Kind” would provide new insights into both Berlin in the 1930s and, in particular, the events related in ""Mr Norris Changes Trains"".The first thing that struck me was the use of the third person. Christopher Isherwood wrote ""Christopher and His Kind"" in the early 1970s and so I assume he decided to treat “Christopher” (his younger self) as a separate character. If so, whilst I understand the rationale, I found it both distracting and confusing.Christopher Isherwood explains how he kept himself out of the Berlin stories as he thought his homosexuality would distract from the narrative and, understandably given the attitudes of the era, he was guarded about being explicit. There is no such evasiveness or coyness in ""Christopher and His Kind"" - he is frank and open about his sex life and his relationships. As such ""Christopher and His Kind” also reflects the era in which it was written (the early 1970s) as gay liberation was gaining momentum whilst Isherwood was writing this book.I didn’t enjoy this book as much as I hoped or expected. As always, Christopher Isherwood writes beautifully about the pre-war era, however it was too detailed for my level of interest and, as I said at the outset, the use of the third person did not work for me. I enjoyed reading about Gerald Hamilton, the real life Arthur Norris from ""Mr Norris Changes Trains"", and who was every bit as venal and morally bankrupt as his fictionalised version, and there are also some interesting anecdotes involving Isherwood’s friends W.H. Auden, Stephen Spender, and E.M. Forster. Overall though I was less captivated than I had hoped and expected.3/5Click here to read my review of ""Mr Norris Changes Trains"" by Christopher Isherwood"
16151,Great Expectations,Kathy Acker,3.54,607,27,Paul Bryant,1,"I read this way back when, when when was only just becoming when. That's few years back now.Anyway, is it not true that if a songwriter writes something like Hallelujah or I Will Always Love You-oo a whole lot of people rush to record it and sometimes do really interesting & different versions - and some versions are better than the original, Jeff Buckley takes over Hallelujah completely just as Elvis took over Hound Dog and Big Mama Thornton was left looking askance. Yet in the world of fiction, this does not happen. Somebody writes a novel and it's supposed to be theirs & theirs alone. You touch my book, I slap you with a writ. Yeah? Yeah! But why can't someone else come along & write their version of your story? This is what Kathy Acker was revolutionalistically suggesting by rewriting very badly Great Expectations. The idea is that you put in a few jazz chords, take out that tiresome riff and add a new one, get rid of the sub plot about the neighbour's wife's suspicions that her son was a rent boy - good god, that was terrible - increase the bpm by a little bit not too much.Well, there is stuff like Pride & Prejudice with Zombies but that's just silly. I was thinking more along the lines of re-doing The Lovely Bones where she doesn't die, so it's more cheerful, or rewriting Philip Roth novels so that the hero has great relationships with women and only has positive things to say about them - but of course keep the same plot and characters. That's important otherwise you might as well just write your own book. Maybe it wouldn't work with books, but it's completely normal in the world of pop songs. In fact songwriters are disappointed if no one else does their stuff. And the songwriters are artists but they don't go around saying ""the guitar break has to stay"" or ""every word of this song has to be sung in the same way by the same person every time"". How silly would it be if authors demanded the same printer is used every time their novel is printed. Absurd. So - I'm quite excited about this - I'm thinking of doing a version of We Need to Talk About Kevin in which they do actually talk about Kevin, and they never buy him any archery lessons, so he puts his talents to use elsewhere and becomes a pretty good banjo player. He joins this little newgrass band, they end up doing really well and one of their albums gets nominated for a Grammy, but it doesn't win. And nobody dies. I think that's a much better version."
16089,Grendel: The Devil Inside,Matt Wagner,3.7,146,6,Paul,4,"This may well be the least grendel-ish Grendel story in the lot.It's still a damned good Grendel story though! Although it does help to cement the gap between the Hunter Rose Grendel and that of Christine Sparr (wow, I'm amazed I remembered her name without having to look it up), it is still a very good stand-alone story.Having read it in its original ""floppy"" form, the later buying the trade paperback and reading that as well... then you all just know that as soon as the hardcover was released, I just had to get that as well, so I guess, this would make it the 5th or 6th time I've actually read this story... and I still enjoy it immensely. Wether that be because it shows us a side of the Grendel monster that is NOT as powerful as its other incarnations, or wether it gives us the story of a flawed and disturbed human being is anybody's guess.All I know is that Matt Wagner hardly ever fails to entertain with his stories... even the stories written this early in his carreer... Now, if only he could write some more Grendel tales for us famished fan-boys!"
16091,Grendel: Devil by the Deed,Matt Wagner,4.07,506,26,Paul,4,"As a backup story in his other series, Mage (1984–1986), Wagner reworked and retold Hunter Rose's story in its entirety. It was collected by Comico in 1986. A new edition, recolored by Bernie Mireault, was published by Dark Horse in 1993. In 2007, it was released in hardcover colored only in black, white, and red. An experiment in illustrated fiction, the panels combine to form something of a static whole on each page, often likened to a stained glass window. Each page is both one picture and several images, arranged much less sequentially than in typical comic book narrative. All of its text appears in accompanying captions, presented as excerpts from a non-fiction book about Hunter Rose.The story begins with an extraordinarily gifted boy, his name only given as Eddie. Because victory in his endeavors came so easily to him, it all seemed meaningless. In despair, he threw a world-championship fencing match, and began a torrid affair with Jocasta Rose, a trainer twice his age. When Jocasta died, Eddie left behind his former life and took on a new persona - or rather two. He became Hunter Rose, successful novelist and socialite, and Grendel, elegant costumed assassin and crime boss. Grendel was hunted relentlessly by Argent, a several hundred year old Native American man-wolf cursed with a thirst for violence, working for the police in an effort to turn his curse to good.Hunter adopted the young daughter of a mobster he recently killed, Stacy Palumbo, who was also befriended by Argent. Hunter was a loving father to Stacy, but when she discovered Hunter was Grendel she sold him out to the wolf. The two antagonists met on the roof of a Masonic temple; the battle left Argent paralyzed, and Grendel unmasked and dead. The police discovered Stacy's role in this incident and her previous murder of a governess to prevent interference with her scheme. Stacy developed severe psychological problems, and she was committed to a mental hospital until adulthood.Within the Grendel universe, Devil By The Deed is the novel written by Christine Spar, Stacy's daughter, about the life of Hunter Rose. It becomes a bestseller, and ""Grendel"" becomes a recognizable pop-culture figure."
16095,Un vestido de domingo,David Sedaris,4.09,206189,5809,Jason Koivu,5,"The Sedaris family is certifiably crazy and I love them. Out of everything he's produced (I've read all of his major work and only missed a few short pieces) this is my favorite David Sedaris book. Yet, I don't recommend it......not always, not to everyone. The subject matter can be too much for some people, especially if they've been told that David Sedaris is a humorist and then they encounter some the more depressing details of his real life experiences. I laugh my ass off at the bottom-feeder personalities and occasional bargain basement morals herein, but some people will wring their hands and cry, ""Oh how awful!""Get over it and enjoy the ride, is my approach. The ride includes experiences of being gay and coming out (horrible and hilarious!), portraits of various family members that bring the people as vividly alive as any long-running sitcom is capable, and living on his own for the first time, which includes apartment living in general and specifically the trials of low-income housing.Sedaris is a master at autobiographical essays. These short form pieces about his life read like carnival folklore, so seemingly unreal at times it feels surreal. Some of his other books are not quite so warts-and-all. If you try Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim on for size, realize it may not suit you. Perhaps try on another first and ease your way into this strange fashion.Audiobook Note: Listening to Sedaris read the audiobook is a must. He wrote the stories, hell, he lived the stories, so he knows how they're to be read. I've listened to him enough now that I can not only read his work in his voice, but also accurately guess at the necessary inflection in new material. Yeah, it's a gift..."
16094,Holidays on Ice,David Sedaris,3.95,91504,4544,Jason,1,"I feel weird reviewing this book right now because the honest truth is: I really genuinely did not like it. And yet I’ve been called out recently by a bunch of helpful strangers on Goodreads for not liking their favorite books—this asshole telling me I should avoid all literary fiction, this one here saying that my problem is with fiction in general—and I fear I’m going to develop a reputation for hating books, and then Otis will kick me off Goodreads and all the mean girls in the Feedback Group will cheer and the only people who will care are the one hundred sixty-four people in my friends list, but then a huge chunk of those people are real-life friends who have only ever logged into Goodreads once, so in the end there are about five people who will care. Maybe six.And that’s not to mention some of these other pressing fears a reviewer has to deal with: what if I rate too many books lowly (will people think I’m just trying to stir the pot and call negative attention to myself?), or what if I rate too many books highly (will people think I’m indiscriminate about which books are my favorites and therefore consider me unreliable?). I suppose there’s also the potential for too many mediocre reviews, and I guess that’s the guy whom everybody thinks can’t make up his freaking mind.In the end, I’m going to just opt for honesty. I disliked this David Sedaris book. I have never read a David Sedaris book before but I understand him to be a very popular comedian and I usually enjoy very popular comedians. Except this book isn’t funny. The initial story around which the entire collection is based, “SantaLand Diaries,” is about Sedaris’s stint as a Christmas elf at a Macy’s department store. The observations of his boss, of the other elves, of parents and children waiting to see Santa, and of the other shoppers are pretty standard fare—there is nothing particularly noteworthy about his comments that made me laugh or even raise an eyebrow in amusement. Of his other stories, there is really only one that is mildly memorable; the rest rely heavily on shock value which is not something that can successfully stand on its own in my opinion. Having said that, I don’t know that I will give up on Sedaris altogether. This book seems sort of thrown together, most of the stories not relating to anything in particular, whether to each other or to any unified theme, but I would expect some of his other collections to have better focus, and I will retain his other books in my “to read” list based on that expectation."
16037,Elephant Dance Memories of India,Theresa Heine,4.04,56,17,Nicole,4,"Ravi, a young boy living in the United States, is filled with questions when his grandfather from India comes to stay with his family. Ravi's eyes are opened up to a whole new world when his grandfather tells him all about the land their family comes from. As Ravi discovers what life is like in another country, he can bridge the gap between his own experiences in the United States and his grandfather's in India as he learns that life might not be so different, after all.The illustrations are vibrant and enjoyable, and the artwork really provides an excellent window into traditional Indian culture and lifestyles. This story is filled with examples of literary elements such as similes and metaphors -- ""rolls into the sky like a fiery ball,"" ""cascades like a waterfall from the sky,"" ""wrinkled as a walnut"" -- as the grandfather tells the story of his home and his life in India. I think this would be a great book to use when discussing similes and metaphors during a language arts lesson. Along with the illustrations, the descriptive language does a wonderful job of helping readers visualize the land of India right along with curious Ravi and his sister.I really like all of the different elements used in this book. Not only is it a fun story for kids to learn about another culture, but the back of the book also serves as an index of sorts, incorporating a good amount of extra history and information about the geography, animals, food, weather, religion, and lifestyle of India.

So Samuel Plum is an underwear buyer for a retail store who has recently lost his job. Desperate for cash, he blackmails his pervert cousin who runs a bail bonds agency into letting him go after a cop named Jane Morellie who was accused of murder and then skipped. There may be a personal revenge motive for Samuel in this because Jane is the girl who seduced him and took his virginity in high school. Since she never called him again, Samuel felt justified in running her over with a car and breaking her leg shortly after that. Now Jane is worth $10,000. Even though he has absolutely no experience or training in law enforcement or as a bounty hunter, Samuel decides he’s going to capture her. He almost immediately stumbles across Jane who basically laughs at him and walks away. So Samuel gets a pistol he doesn’t know how to use or even load. He also allows his senile grandfather to get a hold of the gun because who doesn’t love it when the elderly start waving handguns around in a room full of family members?Samuel’s inexperience quickly gets him into more trouble after he gets assaulted by a female boxer who tries to rape him. Rather than pull his gun on the boxer, he panics and hits her with his man purse. Things get even worse as Jane repeatedly shows up to humiliate him and then get away again. Samuel also gets another person shot when a fugitive takes away his man purse with the gun while Samuel just stands there and allows it to happen. Plus, Samuel’s failure to report the boxer to the police for the attack on him because he doesn’t want to look weak allows two innocent people to be brutally raped and assaulted.Samuel is obviously a moron who has no business running around with a gun and hand cuffs. He also seems to be criminally negligent, and he probably should have been in prison already for running over a sex partner. He also steals Jane’s car when he gets tired of driving his own piece of shit so even though he’s supposedly on the side of law and order, he’s guilty of carrying a concealed weapon and grand theft auto. Samuel is such a nitwit that I have no idea how I’m supposed to relate or sympathize with him. If this was some kind of comic farce, then I could see how a loser getting humiliated by the fugitives he’s supposed to be chasing would be funny, but that kind of goes out the window with the psychotic rapist boxer thing and people getting shot due to Samuel’s utter failure as a bounty hunter.In conclusion, I’ll say that Samuel Plum is a fucktarded asshat who should be beaten with….Oh, wait.

The latest revised edition is great as well, adding updated information. Amazing how the fundamentals never change. I will honestly tell whomever may endeavor to read this seminal work, that it will not be easy to digest, but Mr. Higgs speaks layman academic fluently, thus anyone can properly understand the ""ratchet effect."" I originally read the first edition years ago, but had to read the latest as well. I drew on him myself in my own work ""Our Virtuous Republic"" and future academics will never be able to ignore his thesis - or rather I should say, they can't if they wish to be taken seriously. One of my favorites by far, and probably will always be."

16790,Smoke and Mirrors: Short Fiction and Illusions,Neil Gaiman,4.05,53273,2225,Matt,4,"'Smoke and Mirrors' is the first of two short story collections written by Neil Gaiman. This title was first published in 1998, while 'Fragile Things' came out in 2006. Having read 'Fragile Things' mere months ago I was doing quite a bit of comparison between the two as I worked my way through 'Smoke and Mirrors'. While there are a lot of similarities between the two, there are also many differences.Both collections involve Gaiman doing what he does best, that is taking our own myths, fables, and folklore, tweaking them to better resonate with our modern culture, and handing them back to us complete with the grit and gristle that were absent from the versions that we received as children. While this seems to be an over-arching theme to most of the stories in 'Fragile Things', it still shows up occasionally in 'Smoke and Mirrors' along with so much else. Gaiman takes the reader to so many places throughout these stories. These include a couple of nods to writers that surely influenced him along the way (Lovecraft and Moorcock, specifically), a writer struggling through a screenplay that has been watered down by the movie studio discovering the legendary Hollywood of old, and political intrigue amongst the angels in heaven. Lawrence Talbot also makes an appearance in a tale involving the Wolf Man. Gaiman's books are usually shelved in the Sci-Fi/Fantasy section at the average bookstore, which I think is a bit of a disservice as these stories are so much more diverse than the typical view of the Fantasy genre that involves touchy-feely knights riding around on horses and tends to prejudice the typical reader to that genre negatively.A tip to any readers who are in the habit of skipping book introductions: Gaiman actually hides a story within the introduction of this book as a payoff to those who religiously read the introduction. That sort of cleverness suckers me in every time.It may be unwise to compare the stories in 'Smoke and Mirrors' to each other and to 'Fragile Things' as both books represent more of a compilation of Gaiman stories that appeared in other publications over a particular period of his writing career versus something that was put together as an intentional, unified collection. However, as it is great fun to wildly speculate, I believe that the stories in 'Smoke and Mirrors' are bolder than the ones in the later collection. As most of these stories were written around the time that 'Sandman' was finishing its run, I'm wondering if the reason for this was to prove to any naysayers that Gaiman was a serious writer and not just ""that comic book guy.""These stories may not be something that would be discussed in a college level literature class with the austere professor that lives and dies by the canon, but I don't think that is Gaiman's intention as a writer. He comes from the storyteller tradition, and I feel that such a thing is just as important in feeding one's imagination and intellect as the heavy literature now and again."
16792,The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch,Neil Gaiman,3.78,6356,301,Andrew,4,"This is a tale from earlier years of Neil Gaiman's varied and illustrious career (long may it continue).This edition is from 2006 and although I am no officando of the works and wonders of Neil Gaiman but I can say that for as long as I have known of his works he has always produced something new and unique and reading this I can tell you that its new and unique to me.Now this book tells its story in a combination of hand drawn artwork, composite photographs and combinations of both. The result is both familiar and strangely surreal - which to me reflects the story being narrated.Now without giving away any of the story you have the story of Mr Punch being interwoven with that of the narrator and his family. Here is a combination of moral tale and family history - and where the distinction between the two lies seems to be both vague and arbitrary.In true Neil Gaiman style you have a story which on one level is both entertaining and curious and on another subtle and sublime - yes it is not one of his most famous works but then again depending on where and when you come to his works that too is open to debate. All I can say is to truly appreciate this mans ability you have to sample all of his works and even then I think he has room to shock and surprise you. Having met the man in person I can say that every book of his is different and yet you can see the hand of Mr Gaiman on every page and in every word"
16789,The Good Fairies of New York,Martin Millar,3.51,4646,616,William Owen,5,"That anyone bothers surfing the internet on their own time is absurd. When you are not at work you could be eating, drinking, writing, playing baseball, taking karate, licking someone’s neck, looking at stars, getting into fights or cutting down cell phone towers. What the hell good is sitting down to a high-jacked internet connection if all you are going to do is read Pitchfork the entire night? Get serious about your time, and use those well-paid, or well, paid company hours at your job like the living economic cancer you are and look for great new writers, music, movies, and games. Start researching New Media Economic theory when you are supposed to be collating those reports and you’ll see what I’m talking about. Then go out there and find books like Martin Millar’s The Good Fairies of New York. It is one of those great rewards for using company time to surf the web and one of the best pieces of punk-styled, hard-drinking, fairy-tale to come out in a long time.“Dinnie, an overweight enemy of humanity, was the worst violinist in New York, but was practicing gamely when two cute little fairies stumbled through his fourth-floor window and vomited on the carpet.” Now as first lines go you will need to accept, or at least acknowledge, how perfect that is, and one day you will realize that to be pure literary gold. And perhaps it is simply nostalgia, perhaps it is just a predilection for allusion, reference, and pop-cultural sensibility, but the book is just fun to read. Really. Peaceful diplomatic missions escalate quickly into brawls and artistically minded individuals do battle over a neighborhood arts competition. If there is one prerequisite to a good story, it’s people being passionate about their life because the last thing anyone wants is some inactive, paragonic Rand-ian slug wandering a mall somewhere when he has no money. People need to be doing things, and in The Good Fairies, they do stuff. Oh how they do stuff. The stuff they do, oh my.Over the course of the book you’ll get a super-powered street-woman well versed in roman warfare, the rise of fae industrialism, fae post-industrialism, and fae communist rebellion. You will witness the exploits of the pair of aforementioned sprites as they incite every hard-luck tramp in New York to heights of fury, revenge, class struggle, and love. The combination of real-world and made up world, those illusions Millar splices to his allusions, are sewn seamlessly into the story, and the flight of fantasy that is armed insurrection against an imperial capitalist model is all more rewarding for his efforts on our behalf. By the end we even get Johnny Thunders, late guitarist for the New York Dolls returning to earth from his place in heaven. Hell, even the nameless tramps who succumb to poverty and shuffle from the mortal coil are passionately lamented in these pages. If that isn’t an upbeat, positive message, well what is? But don’t take my word for it, take Neil Gaiman’s, he wrote the introduction, and then maybe you try reading the book."
16998,The Flash: Born to Run,Mark Waid,3.99,586,22,Dirk Grobbelaar,4,"This is basically a retelling of Wally West’s origin as Flash, or, more accurately, how the young Wally West became Kid Flash and sidekick to Barry Allen. What sets this story apart is how Waid takes some time to look at Wally’s emotional development as well as the development of his super power. For those who really don’t know. Wally West took over the mantle of Flash after Barry Allen was killed off during Crisis on Infinite Earths. The story doesn’t aspire to much more than being an origins re-telling, but it’s deceptively effective. The best bit: that speedball that Barry Allen throws for West in order to test if the speedforce has manifested."
16999,"Fantastic Four, Vol 5: Disassembled",Mark Waid,3.33,159,12,Sr3yas,3,"Two separate story arcs were mashed together in this collection and branded under disassembled tag.The very average first story arc which has nothing to do with disassembled arc deals with sinister four...uh, no horrible fo..um.. some thoroughly unmemorable villain team going against fantastic four.Second story arc was much better. It takes place after the whole disassembled story. When New York is attacked by aliens, apparently FF is the only team who can take them on (which is actually dumb when you think about it.) But the ending of the story was really cool!"
16047,A Thread of Grace,Mary Doria Russell,4,11078,1278,Violet wells,4,"A Thread of Grace tells the story of the Nazi occupation of a region of north east Italy. It begins with an uprooted community of Jews in southern France who have to flee France across the Alps when the Italians sign the armistice. It’s essentially the story of how these refugees fare in Italy. When I discovered Mary Doria Russell had invented all the locations in the novel I was a bit dubious as so often this is a trick writers use to mask the sparseness of their knowledge. But the thoroughness of the research in this novel and the beautiful lightness with which it carries it is breathtaking. This is no The Nightingale where one felt the author had spent two weeks in France, had no knowledge of the language beyond oui and merde and had read a couple of books on the war and watched a few films. Russell has an intimate knowledge of Italy, Italians and every aspect of her material which is impressively wide. She sets herself the task of telling the story from all sides – so the cast of characters is expansive: we have the Gestapo, Wehrmacht officers, a chief Rabbi, Catholic priests, Nuns, a German deserter, partisans, fascists, an English SOE officer, children, mothers, fathers and grandparents. Were I to be hyper-critical I might say there were too many characters and as a result it was difficult to emotionally bond with any one specific character. It didn’t though bother me though I can imagine it might try the patience of some readers. Sometimes you have to read back to remind yourself who someone is, not helped by a couple of characters changing their identity. Only other nitpick was now and again a character would deliver a history lesson – in those times propaganda was rife and no one knew for certain what was happening so when a character gives a detailed account of what exactly German divisions on other fronts are doing or what Allied tactics were it jarred a bit. The majority of WW2 novels tend to do this. I’m reading the journal of an Italian partisan at the moment and despite being very well connected she doesn’t have much of a clue what’s going on in the war. It’s all rumours. I suspect fiction has contributed to the notion we now have that many more people knew about the Holocaust while it was happening than in reality did. My partisan woman certainly knew nothing about it. It’s a fascinating subject in itself how fiction begins to alter our perception of historical events. So A Thread of Grace is a tremendously enjoyable novel with no other pretensions but to tell a fabulously well-crafted story (and into the bargain pay homage to the humanity and bravery of the Italian people in helping a persecuted friendless people in need). Most beguiling of all its characteristics was the love with which this novel was written. You could feel that heartbeat of love on every page. Other notable novels set in Italy during WW2 for anyone interested (I’m on a mission to read them all).The Way Back to Florence, Early One Morning, Trieste, In Love and War"
16046,Before You Know Kindness,Chris Bohjalian,3.46,9461,1027,Jennifer,5,"I LOVED this book. I don't know why people are saying it was slow moving. I loved the pace. It's a character piece, and the suspense is in the slow and detailed unfolding of their lives and secret thoughts. To me, this book is a lot about what people think every day, but never reveal to each other, and how that affects what they can and can't say (or do) later. And, I liked that the author took a hard stance against animal activists -- not because I have anything against them. Like most of us, I tend to assume that, ""Animal activists are GOOD people, becaue they're saving animals, aren't they???!?!?"" And, I didn't think less of any actual animal activists after I read the book. It just reminded me that things aren't always what they seem. An occupation does not define a man -- contrary to popular belief, lawyers aren't necessarily selfish and money-grubbing, actors aren't necessarily narcissistic, doctors aren't necessarily altruistic, and animal activists come in all shapes and sizes and moral character as well. Anyway, I can understand that not everyone enjoyed this book, but I thought it was one of my favorite all-time reads. I loved the dialogue. I thought every moment of the book was packed with meaning. Every detail of every conversation was significant to the story in some small way, I didn't want to miss a word. But, hey, I'm also a slow reader, so EVERY book is slow to me! HAH!"

16055,The Magician's Assistant,Ann Patchett,3.64,26623,2755,Laura,4,"I know you are thinking, is there a book you don't like, Laura? Here's the deal. If I don't like a book I can barely read it, much less finish it. So if I do read it-I like it, in varying degrees, but I like it. So tonight I read the Magician's Assistant, by Ann Patchett. If you have read Bel Canto, (and you should have, though I'm not sure I'm spelling it right at the moment.)then you know her style. You get hypnotised by the story, by the language, you get into this rhythm that you can't break until you finish it, so you keep reading and reading until it is 12:15 in the am and you are finally done, but then you can't believe it ends. What!! Ends!! You are not ready, but there you have it. You sit there for a while, because you're thinking if you open the book again, you will have found that you missed a chapter, that there is MORE.When a story ends but leaves you still thinking about each character and who they are and why they do what they do, that they are probable, even if their situations aren't, and what would happen if the story kept going, then it is a story worth reading. So read it!"

16057,Taft,Ann Patchett,3.42,4399,425,Arah-Lynda,4,"A Girl walked into the bar. What a great opening line. Right away it had me asking questions.This is the fourth Patchett novel I have read and one of her earliest. While not as good as Bel Canto or State of Wonder it is still a very enjoyable read. John Nickel lives in Memphis and is an ex jazz drummer and current bar manager. The girl that walks into his bar is Fay Taft and through her we meet her brother Carl. John over identifies with these two troubled teenagers who have recently and very suddenly lost their father. Perhaps this is because John’s on again, off again, girlfriend Marion has relocated to Miami, thereby separating him from his own young son.Over time John’s involvement with Fay and Carl takes him down a twisted, dangerous path and he begins to obsess over the imagined life and death of their Father.This story meets it’s conclusion in a very open ended way so if you are one of those people that want all their questions answered and all the ends tied up, this one will likely frustrate you. As for me I found it to be quite a stunning achievement. "
16053,The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: The Hidden World of a Paris Atelier,Thad Carhart,3.95,4185,547,Tony,3,"Piano Teacher: Not bad... Mr. Connors, you say this is your first lesson?Phil: Yes, but my father was a piano *mover*, so...Much like Thad Carhart passing by Desforges Pianos: outillage, fournitures, I was intrigued first by the lovely cover (the hardbound edition) and welcoming title of this book. I wanted to enter through the curtained door, into a dusty world I did not know.Inside, we find des pianos éventrés (disemboweled pianos), and Luc who modestly says, Je ne suis qu'un bricoleur (I'm only a handyman). Luc finds pianos - Steinways, Bechsteins, Chickerings, Pleyels - and restores them. Then he goes about finding the right human pair for the instrument. Who will get the 1820 Erard, that Beethoven might have played?I do not speak French nor do I play the piano, but Carhart must have guessed that because he consistently translated the charming French phrases for me and he ably explained the inner workings of the furniture that also makes music.Carhart has a good ear:On ne fait pas de musique contre quelqu'un (One does not make music against someone else). Le jeu, c'est l'âme de la mécanique (Play is the soul of the machine).He quotes an Hungarian pianist and teacher, ""There is no such thing as music note by note just as there is no such thing as a book word by word. We have to accept that things are ambiguous.""He explained the mechanics enough and the differences in pianos. He talked about his lifetime passion for pianos - the instrument, really, more so than the music itself. And he takes us into the quartier, where Luc (not his real name) welcomes the American and, by extension, us. You can learn a lot by watching how people interact with an alcoholic piano tuner. Best for me was when the various characters - students, teachers, craftsmen - would meet, and someone would sit down at a piano, and ....PLAY.

16773,The Case of the Buried Clock,Erle Stanley Gardner,3.81,616,28,Evgeny,4,"A wealthy guy called Jack Hardisty had a problem. Not only his son-in-law embezzled some money from a bank, but he also managed to blackmail his rich relative by the fact. At the same time Jack was about to have much bigger problem. He let a World War II vet (the book was written at exactly this time) stay in his mountain cabin to improve his failing health. Poking around the guy found a perfectly working wound up clock buried nearby. He decided to leave it where he found it only to find it gone one day later. To make up for it an unknown person left a dead body instead. In the best series tradition practically every single member of Hardisty family could qualify for a prime suspect, so Perry Mason to the rescue! The prominent lawyer never takes on mundane cases, but the clock did it for him. Would it be a spoiler if I mentioned the said gadget kept him puzzled until practically the last page? Speaking old-fashioned clocks I need to mention as a rule they were unbelievably reliable. I used one during my freshman year of college - it looked cool and antique - and it never let me down, even after spending one day in a bucket of water (long story). Try doing it with a modern alarm clock, but make sure you are not attached to it before starting the experiment.This book has it all: an exciting courtroom drama, a complicated mystery, astronomy and astrology lessons, and finally Perry Mason outsmarting himself!!! You read it right: the guy was too smart for his own good, the first and hopefully the last time. Worry not, he will amend his ways in the very last moment and the truth will win. So as it was obvious from my babbling above this one is among the best books of the series so far. My rating is 4 stars on the high end of 4."
16056,Truth And Beauty,Ann Patchett,3.94,28613,2676,Barbara Mader,1,"I didn't care for it, for several reasons. First of all, I didn't think much of the quality of the writing--certainly nothing like Lucy Grealy's in her own memoir. Second, I found both women's behavior in the friendship really strange. Ann seems completely blank in the relationship, never asserting any real personality, and completely enabling Lucy's neediness and selfishness. Lucy just sounded like a black hole, sucking up every bit of attention, affection, needing more and more extravagant declarations of love. She sounded exhausting.And finally, I think it exploitative of Ann Pratchett to write a book like this about someone she supposedly felt was her best friend when that person could no longer respond, particularly as Ann wasn't truly writing about the relationship at all. She did not write about her own feelings of the friendship, why and how it developed as it did, what kept them together, what she learned about herself, how (or whether!) Lucy brought out the best in her, etc.; in fact, there seems to be very little reflection on or ownership about her own behavior. Mostly it seems to be an expose' about Lucy. I just came away feeling that both these women sounded really messed up, needy, difficult, self-absorbed, and not at all self-aware, and that both had a habit of using terrible judgment in their personal lives. Yuck. If this is truth--I do mean ""if""--it's not beauty, and I wonder why anyone would want either of them as a friend."

16776,"I Dreamed I Married Perry Mason (A Cece Caruso Mystery, #1)",Susan Kandel,3.48,824,112,David,4,"The title of this one grabbed me while shopping in a local used bookstore. I had never read this author before, but the title just sort of tickled my reading funny-bone and so I picked it up. I was NOT disappointed. Cece Caruso's is a biographer by trade. As our story opens she is working on biographical material on Erle Stanley Gardner, the creator of Perry Mason as well as the private eye team of Bertha Cool and Donald Lam. (He also did quite a bit of pulp writing under a number of pen names- and I am interested in tracking down one of his stories about a ""human fly"" who solves crimes. Anyway, she has a serious case of writer's block when she stumbles onto a mis-filed letter to the author, who once was active in a type of ""innocence"" project - helping review and investigate hopeless cases of folks who claimed innocence but were sitting in prisons, or even on death row. This leads her to an investigation of a decades old murder and she does so with gusto.As the story progresses, our heroine stumbles back and forth between working on proving the convict's innocence, the need to continue her biographical work, as well as dealing with her daughter's marital problems. Okay, the daughter's situation could probably have been left out and the novel might have been a bit better.Another part of the story (apparently it will pay a key part of this series) is the heroine's fashion sense. She is a fashionista, and many references are made to styles, fashions, designers, accessories, etc. Honestly, this distracted me-- because I felt that the story was much better when the author was exploring the biographical background. In fact, this book was most interesting because of its description of Mr. Gardner's life, activities, and places where he lived and worked. It excelled when describing the locales that the heroine was visiting or the episodes of Perry Mason, or simply the plethora of titles mentioned and a brief description of Gardner's ability to create wonderful titles that offered both an exciting cadence and a catchy wording. Eventually, the author is forced to move the characters into some odd situations, and some things that normal people wouldn't do (sneaking into an actual crime scene at night).. but I think the historical background, etc. keeps this one rolling along, past the fashion nonsense, etc. to a fitting conclusion, with a well-written mystery and enough interesting characters to hold the reader's interest to the end. "
16775,A Perry Mason Mystery: The Case of the Curious Bride/Audio Cassettes,Erle Stanley Gardner,3.83,1551,56,Evgeny,4," Curiosity killed a cat.Nobody could even accuse Perry Mason's book plots of being too straightforward, or being straightforward at all. For this reason my description of the beginning of the plot might not even make sense: it looks something like following: A young woman came to Perry Mason for a consultation. She used old as the world trick saying she was making her inquiries in the behalf of her ""friend"". Even the most clueless reader could see through it, not to mention a hardened criminal defense attorney. Perry Mason politely but firmly asked her to come clean, but the woman called his bluff and left. At this point the layer realized two things: she already left a retainer for his services with his secretary and he feels guilty about his treatment of her. He started looking for her - not an easy feat considering she gave Mason a fake name and address - and found her just in time to defend her against a murder charge. Something I noticed by reading fifth book of the series: most of the people killed had been really asking for this. In fact at the end of the book Mason remarks that the murder victim had to be murdered. At this point I am very curious whether an innocent person - or relatively innocent - gets to meet his/her untimely demise in any installment. My usual notes about the series apply: a very complicated murder mystery, some very fine and unexpected maneuverings in the courtroom trademarked by Perry Mason make this one a very easy and hard to put down read. The final rating is 4 stars."
16774,The Case of the Calendar Girl,Erle Stanley Gardner,3.79,310,20,Melindam,5,"Unbelievable! This is book #56 of the Perry Mason series and you'd think Erle Stanley Gardner ran out of ideas & steam, but NO SUCH THING!There is a double twist to the story with Mason defending a client in a murder case, and once he is in the clear, he goes on defending the woman who turns suspect after the initial case is closed.This is a very exciting read - the action grips you right at the very beginning and doesn't let you out of its clutches until the murder mystery is solved. We are back to the courtroom for legal fireworks and my, do they explode with a BANG! Hamilton Burger should really know better by now than to think he can outsmart Perry Mason, but let it be said for him, at least he never gives up trying. So, Schadenfreude-factor is at work to enhance the enjoyment, but I cannot help myself. :)And a lovely BONUS: for the very first time, Lieutenant Tragg - the ""worthy adversary"" cop & reluctant friend to Perry Mason - goes out of his way to find Mason and involve him in the investigation & we are given a chance to see the action -some parts of it anyway- from his / the police's point of view."

16810,The Berlin Stories: The Last of Mr Norris/Goodbye to Berlin,Christopher Isherwood,4.03,8900,434,Teresa,4,"The Last of Mr. Norris (1935): 3 starsGoodbye to Berlin (1939): 4.5 starsI started this book before the events at Charlottesville; unfortunately, it proved timely. Based on his own experiences living in pre-WWII Berlin, Isherwood writes of the Nazis being talked of, even laughed at, at first; and by the book's end of their stalking the streets and terrorizing Jewish citizens, the police powerless to do anything about it. For the most part, though, that’s ‘just’ the background and atmosphere: character (in both senses of the word) is foremost in both of these works. Yet it’s because of what’s going on in the ‘background’ that the characters achieve their importance as they live their lives under, and in spite of, an increasing atmosphere of menace.Your response to Isherwood’s characters will vary depending on your tolerance for ‘characters’, i.e. eccentrics, for lack of a better word. Mr. Norris of the first novella is not the kind of character I warm to, though perhaps it is more that this is an earlier work than the other, and with the latter Isherwood found his voice. In the second work, a collection of pieces that nevertheless make a coherent whole, the character of Sally Bowles is a revelation (she is not Liza Minnelli at all) and I was dismayed when her section ended—not to worry, she makes one more appearance. The other characters may not be as memorable as Sally (though all Isherwood's female characters are remarkable), but they and their stories are all part of the stage upon which Isherwood always gives himself a minor role. The author’s preface tells of his first visit to Berlin since before the war, after the success of the Broadway play I Am a Camera, which was adapted from his story ""Sally Bowles"" and starred Julie Harris (whom he thought was more Sally than the ‘real’ Sally). During this 1952 visit, he hears the war stories of his indomitable former landlady, sees the places he’d lived in and hopes someone will, one day, write the story of the ‘new’ Berlin."
16807,John Milton: The Major Works,John Milton,4.24,290,16,Bruce,3,"At long last I completed reading Milton’s The Major Works, a tome that I’ve been working on for a month, finding it to be alternately interesting and boring, excellently organized, progressing sequentially through Milton’s shorter poetry, his prose writings - mostly political - , “Paradise Lost”, and finally his late works, “Paradise Regained” and “Samson Agonistes.” The introduction was useful, as was the Teaching Company course that I listened to simultaneously. Milton’s use of language is impressive if sometimes overblown, and I was impressed with the breadth of his knowledge of literature, history, and classical mythology, even while wondering how modern readers who may have a limited knowledge of these could possibly make sense of the work. I find the whole “sin and redemption” theme uncongenial to my thinking and convictions, so I read “Paradise Lost,” the longest selection in the book, with an eye more to the literary than theological dimensions, finding the long passages that restated Biblical narrative boring but the extensive and intricate dialogues of great subtlety and psychological penetration. Milton’s gender biases, no doubt characteristic of his era, anti-Papism, and intimate involvement in the history of mid-17th Century England – Cromwell, the interregnum, the Restoration – are issues that cannot not be ignored throughout his writings, as are common threads such as his blindness and concern with paternity, literal and figurative. I’m glad to have reacquainted myself with his work, since it forms such a basis for subsequent English literature, a touchstone that later authors responded to and reacted against, it being hard fully to understand subsequent literary history without knowing Milton."
16809,Christopher and His Kind,Christopher Isherwood,4.12,2265,129,Nigeyb,3,"Frank, and beautifully written, however I was less captivated than I'd expectedImmediately prior to reading ""Christopher and His Kind"" by Christopher Isherwood I read, and really enjoyed, ""Mr Norris Changes Trains”, so I was excited to find out more about Christopher Isherwood’s life during the 1930s.""Christopher and His Kind"" is an autobiographical account of Christopher Isherwood's life from 1929, when he left England to spend a week in Berlin and decided to stay there indefinitely, through to 1939, when he arrived in America. I hoped ""Christopher and His Kind” would provide new insights into both Berlin in the 1930s and, in particular, the events related in ""Mr Norris Changes Trains"".The first thing that struck me was the use of the third person. Christopher Isherwood wrote ""Christopher and His Kind"" in the early 1970s and so I assume he decided to treat “Christopher” (his younger self) as a separate character. If so, whilst I understand the rationale, I found it both distracting and confusing.Christopher Isherwood explains how he kept himself out of the Berlin stories as he thought his homosexuality would distract from the narrative and, understandably given the attitudes of the era, he was guarded about being explicit. There is no such evasiveness or coyness in ""Christopher and His Kind"" - he is frank and open about his sex life and his relationships. As such ""Christopher and His Kind” also reflects the era in which it was written (the early 1970s) as gay liberation was gaining momentum whilst Isherwood was writing this book.I didn’t enjoy this book as much as I hoped or expected. As always, Christopher Isherwood writes beautifully about the pre-war era, however it was too detailed for my level of interest and, as I said at the outset, the use of the third person did not work for me. I enjoyed reading about Gerald Hamilton, the real life Arthur Norris from ""Mr Norris Changes Trains"", and who was every bit as venal and morally bankrupt as his fictionalised version, and there are also some interesting anecdotes involving Isherwood’s friends W.H. Auden, Stephen Spender, and E.M. Forster. Overall though I was less captivated than I had hoped and expected.3/5Click here to read my review of ""Mr Norris Changes Trains"" by Christopher Isherwood"
16804,The Life of John Milton,Barbara Kiefer Lewalski,3.97,30,6,Nelson,4,"Will stand for some time as the readable one-volume biography of Milton. It doesn't replace Parker (which nevertheless needs replacing), but it doesn't seem intended to. These Blackwell lives claim to have a mandate to offer readable summations that avoid unnecessary scholarly carping. That's a difficult task to achieve with Milton, whose life and views invite precisely such fraught debates. Lewalski nevertheless masters a rather large body of critical material and takes positions on important issues without allowing the arguments to overwhelm the life. Some may take issue with the structure of the text. Chapters end with a close reading of particular texts described earlier in the chapter. While this procedure has the value of putting, say, 20 pages on Paradise Lost in one place, the fact is that the preceding chapters often discuss historical and social background in ways that necessarily lead to some discussing of the text being 'saved' for the end of the chapter. It's a tricky balancing act that sometimes leaves chapters feeling as if they are holding themselves back for the explication de texte rather than saying everything they know. In other words, if one reads this volume purely for interpretations of the poetry or prose, one will inevitably find oneself hopscotching about more than one may wish. If you have the patience to hear (some) things twice, the organization won't bother you. With a scholar as generally balanced and fair and broadly knowledgeable as Lewalski, it's worth being patient. What will absolutely try your patience, however, is the volume's utterly asinine handling of the notes. It's clear that modern print practices mandate endnotes over footnotes. But why on earth are there not sensible indicators in the Notes section, for what pages the notes are intended? The entire Notes section has the completely worthless header 'Notes'. No shit. Since Lewalski typically has hundreds of notes per chapter, one actually has to flip through a dozen pages to find out if the footnote 104 you are looking for (and mistakenly think you have found) is for chapter 13 or chapter 14 or chapter 3. Other Blackwell lives (see DeMaria's Johnson) don't do this, so why this moronic economy of ink was employed here, making the notes a pain to look through, is beyond me."
16811,My Guru And His Disciple,Christopher Isherwood,3.94,196,15,John,5,"Wonderful memoir of Isherwood's appretenceship in Vedanta practice and a loving portrait of his guru, Swami Prabhavananda. The book is also a great ""inside"" view of the beginnings of the settling of eastern wisdom teachings on western shores, here in sunny southern California. Isherwood's writing is disarmingly clear, terse, and honest, and he writes movingly of his struggles with Vedanta practices and ideas and openly of his homosexuality and sexual adventures. The book moves between reflective historical or personal accounts and excepts from Isherwood's diaries. Mostly the book is about Swami, a seemingly wonderful being who Isherwood devotedly loved. This is a portrait of a real person who appears not to have an ego or any hang-ups. He is patient with and devoted to his students, utterly embracing them, faults and all. I liked most one of Isherwood's lines to the effect of the Swami was the only person he met in his life who loved so deeply and constantly, and who ""didn't stand in the way of the light"" or put his mind in the way of things - like the rest of neurotics do - but let it shine through everything he did. The Swami's selflessness was not some kind of stoned-out radiance or rocklike sternness, but just his deep love, simple ease, warmth and patience. He's hilarious too."
16420,Selected Short Stories,P.G. Wodehouse,4.27,52,9,Hande,4,"Love it... absolute classic. The language is so English and so old school - wonderful. The book itself is one I bought from Robert College discarded books sale. It may even be one of the original editions :) We used to have Jeeves and Wooster TV series dubbed in Turkish when I was in my teens and TRT Radio 2 used to broadcast the original English. So i'd be sat with my family with my headphones on listening to it in English. It must have been then that I bought the book! Long-winded story, but there we are. The only problem I have now, is that I have Stephen Fry's voice in my ear every time Jeeves says ""Indeed, sir?"". Rummy what not, and don't you know.Finished awhile ago, and absolutely loved it, laughing out loud at most places. However, it makes you think long and hard about the gap between the classes. Especially if you're not from England, and you don't grow up with it, you think it is hilarious. But one wonders about the reality."
16430,"City of Night (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, #2)",Dean Koontz,3.97,18705,737,Mike (the Paladin),4,"Well....that was interesting. If I could I'd give this one a 3.5. It picks up almost at the instant the first book ends and follows the story, the characters. It takes a little while to get back to the, development, at the end of said first book. But...oh my....it spins us some new threads.My concern here is that Mr. Kontz may spin this one out so that he has too many plot threads. He writes good ""serviceable"" prose. At times he comes across as gifted but his novels (for me) are a mixed bag. Some are among my favorites some i don't care for at all. Here I'm still interested but the book seems to be verging on the absurd in a few places.I don't want to give spoilers in the review (as this is a good book) but I think I can say that the developments in the ""new species"" is taking some odd turns. These are turns that the ""creator"" of said species never expected.The book also is blatantly a chapter in a continuing story. The climax...the end of the book ties up a plot point while ending almost in a mid-chapter feeling. This one is a no-nonsense, no hiding it cliffhanger ending leading into the next book.Okay, pretty good. I'll go 3.5 but round up to 4. Enjoy."
16217,Justice for the Dead: Forensic Pathology in the Hot Zone,Malcolm J. Dodd,4.31,13,1,Annie,3,"Malcolm Dodd is a man who is passionate about his job. But you would have to for the type of work he does. He really believes that the forensic work that he does with the bodies of victims of war & disaster has a profound effect for the good. But - a warning, don't read this book if you are at all squeamish!! Dodd is quite plain & factual about describing the bodies that he deals with and how the injuries were inflicted. He may be a great pathologist, but he's not such a great writer. Even with the help of a co-author the book is about as dry and factual as an autopsy report at times. Towards the end it did get a little repetative & boring & he has a thing about using acronyms - and then saying what they stand for EACH time!! I think that only a person with such a great self belief could manage to do the type of work he does and remain so cheerful & upbeat, so in that way the book was inspiring. It was also educational about conflicts that have happened in recent times in our world, and the terrible consequences for individuals & nations. Now I want to understand more - especially about Kosova & what happened in the former Yugoslavia, and about the issues in the Solomons - as we know someone who has lived there. A worthwhile read if the topics interest you. "

Learning who the real Damian is, as he was trying to figure it out for himself, and having Uncle Yank push each of them a little along the way was just so enjoyable. I love how he's declared himself the matchmaker for the girls! Micki was beyond lovable. Who can't relate to her self-esteem issues, and to see her fumble along the way a little bit before she found her guy. It was a nice progression and a believable one to see the path she took. She didn't completely leave her tomboy self in the past which I really liked, but just through trying new things she turned into a person she was happy being. But the nicest part was Damian was already falling for her long before she started experimenting with being more girly.It was just a really well rounded story. A great relationship, a resolution to Yank and Lola, a side story with Carole and Carter - I wasn't really invested in this except for Damian's direct POV on it, and it seemed like Carter made a pretty fast 180 between the character we were introduced to, to the character he ended up trying to be, but it was a small detail and Micki and Damian overshadowed them, rightfully so! Fun, fast read and I'm jumping right into Sophie's book!"
16225,The Way of the Wild Heart: A Map for the Masculine Journey,John Eldredge,4.14,1245,65,Zach Krall,3,"I almost dropped this book towards the middle and I'm glad I didn't. It's a reverse bell curve type of book. Started out rather inspiring, but took awhile to ramble around his points in the middle. The last few chapters delve more into men's roles as a ""lover"", a ""king"", and a ""sage"" and led up to a rather inspiring finish. He provides lots of interesting anecdotes and family stories to summarize his points, but this may not be the best book for someone who wants a direct, quick answer. His voice and story are clear, and it is a feel-good book appropriate for any stage in life. Must read Wild at Heart first!"
16213,The Hot Zone: The Terrifying True Story of the Origins of the Ebola Virus,Richard   Preston,4.1,77437,3969,Oddmix,5,Terror at the personal level.Very personal for me...I read this book while on night watch in the Army. I was eating cheap red licorice at a frenzied pace while I read from sheer nerves. The idea of bleeding out through every bodily opening was terrifying. The next morning I went to the bathroom and discovered that cheep red licorice passes nearly untouched through the human digestive system. It goes in red and comes out red - blood red. I very nearly screamed before I realized what I was seeing.I will NEVER forget this book.
16218,"Biohazard, the hot zone and beyond: Mankind's battle against deadly disease",Peter Brookesmith,3.57,7,1,Sheila,3,"Copyright 1997 and therefore somewhat dated in 2008, the book is still terrifying. It traces the history of deadly infectious disease (bubonic plague is specifically detailed, as is malaria, cholera, and yellow fever); to the creation of ""superbugs""; and the history of AIDS up to the point of publication.I found the chapter on the emergence of hidden viruses fascinating - Ebola, Marburg, Lassa fever - and how man's own actions may be responsible for the emergence of these particularly gruesome (and almost always deadly) diseases. It also somewhat briefly addresses measures taken in the past, as well as those needing to be put in place in the future, to avoid the spread of all infectious disease."
16226,The Way of the Wild Heart Manual: A Personal Map for Your Masculine Journey,Craig McConnell,4.11,27,3,Adam Nelson,5,"It's been several years since I read Wild at Heart, and this book is meant to be read quickly after that. There are many concepts Eldredge expands on here that he introduces in the earlier book, but once read and understood, you'll never forget them, and I don't feel my reading was hampered by the long interim between books. I will say that I've grown up a lot between readings, and so certain concepts affected me differently than they had in Wild at Heart, most notably the ""father wound"". Eldredge says every man has one, this gaping hold left by the imperfection of their upbringing with their earthly fathers. Previously, I had assumed that he was really saying that every father is a failure, no matter how good he was, and therefore any man who says that he either doesn't have issues with his father or has learned to forgive has not dealt with it entirely. Now I know that I had misunderstood, perhaps because I had not entirely come to terms with my past. Since then, I have developed a deeper, closer bond with my father than I ever had before, and while he's not perfect, he did fine. I turned out great. And no father IS perfect. Eldredge says this is by design, for God means for us to find in Him what our fathers can't do for us, and our dads' role is to raise us to understand we are beloved and capable men, to build up our confidence while at the same time leading us to the One who completes the father's role where he falls short. The Way of the Wild Heart is essential reading for every man. Whereas Wild at Heart was an intellectual, emotional, discussion-oriented book, its sequel is a book of action that will get you off your butt and headed for adventure. You can't sit still after reading this one. It's not what we're designed to do. Well done."
16187,The Little House,Philippa Gregory,3.65,1965,262,Elizabeth,4,"Though the jacket says that this book is ""tragicomic,"" implying that there are funny parts, it is actually pretty devastating to read. Ruth, the main character, deals with so much sadness, from tragedies in her past to the manipulating mental abuse she suffers at the hands of her husband and in-laws. Her husband is a selfish, stupid, arrogant, spoiled sorry excuse for a human, and her in-laws are only slightly better. Though the ending is kind of funny and triumphant in a creepy way, I think that it's terribly sad to think of a real person going through these kinds of experiences and having no way out. Realistically, most people would (hopefully) not deal with their problems the way Ruth did but, as the reader, you feel a compassion for her and you understand that she truly had no other way out without losing her child. I think Gregory did an amazing job of creating complex characters whose faults you can clearly see, but whose side you may be able to understand as well (except for Ruth's husband; I saw nothing redeeming about him at all and I imagine that's how Gregory intended it). Ultimately, I came away from this book with an unsettled, sad feeling and an overwhelming compassion for the strains and trials endured by new mothers."
