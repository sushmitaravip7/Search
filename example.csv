7,"The Harry Potter Collection (Harry Potter, #1-6)",J.K. Rowling,4.73,26702,909,Jen Holman,5,"I do not own this spiffy box set of Harry Potter books, but no way was I going to sit down and input all 6 of them!! When we were in the UK on our honeymoon in the spring of 2000, Harry Potter fever was just hitting its stride there. Not long after that the books found their way to Canada and I fell in love with this series right from the first book. Again (I'm a broken record) great characters and time-old literary themes, as well as just being a very enjoyable read. I haven't gone to see the movies, because I don't want the characters in my mind replaced with British teen actors and Gary Oldman. (can't stand Gary Oldman.) Fantastic read for any age. Some of my all-time favourite literary characters are from this series, like Dumbledore and Sirius Black. The books get heavier (literally and metaphorically) as the series progresses. The first book is the most child-like, shorter and lighter fare. The last book is downright philosophical and practically qualifies as a doorstop it's so weighty. The HP series is kind of like literary comfort food around here, if there's nothing else to read we'll just grab one and dive in. A definite must-read!"
3,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,J.K. Rowling,4.44,4911929,77741,Lora,5,"I'm going to keep this brief since there isn't much to say that hasn't already been said. *clears throat*I think the reason I waited so long to read this series is because I just couldn't imagine myself enjoying reading about an eleven-year-old boy and his adventures at a school of wizardry. I thought it would be too juvenile for my taste. I was wrong, of course.I can honestly say that I loved every minute of this. It's a spectacular little romp with funny, courageous, and endearing characters that you can't help but love.It has talking chess pieces, singing hats, a giant three-headed dog named Fluffy, a hilarious giant with a dragon fetish, a master wizard that's just a little bit crazy, mail carrier owls, goblins running a bank, unicorns, centaurs(!), trolls . . . and probably much more that I'm forgetting. And then there's the lead characters: Hermione, the young scholar who starts out prim and up-tight but soon becomes a true friend; Ron, the boy who has little money but who has an abundance of family and loyalty to his friends to make up for it; and then there's Harry, the boy who starts out sleeping in a closet and ends up being a hero. Harry is kind to those that deserve it, fearless when it counts the most, and wonderfully intelligent. What's not to love? In regards to the ending: (view spoiler)[I feel silly saying this about a middle grade novel, but I didn't suspect Quirrell a bit! If there were hints that he was the true culprit and not Snape, I obviously missed them. (hide spoiler)]FAVORITE QUOTE: ""But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.""Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to start Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.*******************************************************My reviews of other titles in this series:Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"
1,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Harry Potter, #6)",J.K. Rowling,4.54,1810404,28053,Cait (Paper Fury),5,"""Read Harry Potter!"" they said. ""It'll be fun!"" they said. ""Our childhood was built on Harry Potter!"" they said.WELL YOUR CHILDHOODS WERE ALL HORRIBLE. OMG WHAT IS THIS BOOK? WHAT IS THIS MESS I'M IN?? Excuse me, but that large salty lake where my life used to be is my tears. Yes, yes, this means I loved it. But SERIOUSLY. Nooooot okay. At the end there, especially, I couldn't put the audio down so I was wandering about my house in a blind daze listening instead.And because every human and their fluffy poodle has probably sensibly reviewed this book, BAH. I'm just going to make a list of things I loved and things I didn't. My Intense And Passionate LOVES:• Harry + Ginny = yes. I was dubious at first. Like I think romance is NOT JKR's strong point...plus when she gets to a romantic scene she ends the chapter. HHAHAH. ADORABLE. (Not that I minded, I just...I think she's not good at romance.) But omg, there was that moment after the Quidditch match??? YUP. You know what I'm talking about. Excuse me, my heart just ran around in circles screaming and shipping.• Hermione: I adore her, but...I gotta admit, she was a little bit too stuffy. BUT I STILL LOVE HER. I love her love for learning.• I also adore how sensible Ginny is. • Fred and George's joke shop gives life. Also death, probs, but liiiiife.• I am utterly in LOVE with the whole concept of Hogwarts. I mean, I think it's stupid that they have to write with a quill and ink (can't they just enchant the quill to write for them?) and they seem to get an excessive amount of homework, BUT. It's all so vivid and detailed and it literally feels like Hogwarts is A REAL PLACE. I totally get why people wail about their letters going missing. • Speaking of detail...me likey. I always felt inside the story.• Plus the audio book (narrated by Jim Dale) is GREAT. I totally recommend it. I think Hermione's voice had a tendency to sound like an insufferable goat, but I got used to it. Harry's voice was perfection. • I also particularly liked Harry in this book. I JUST LOVE HARRY. <3 He's snarky, but he's lost some of the angriness from bk 5. He's got snarky quips at the ready, but he's also intensely...good. Like he's just a really GOOD chap, who makes bad decisions but really means well. ZOMG. *flails about* He was definitely my favourite character in this book. • ALSO DUMBLEDORE WAS GREAT. I love Dumbledore and how he's always polite and kind and smiley. (view spoiler)[ CAN WE TALK A MINUT EHOW I'M NOT OKAY THAT HE'S DEAD?!??!?!? LIKE WHAT EVEN THE FLYING HECK OF BROOMS NEST TAILS. THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. BUT IT SHOULDN'T. BECAUSE NOTHING MAKES SENSE. Dumbledore. no. Come baaaaaaaack. *breaks down into a mess* I am also intensely furious that his weakening himself to get the horcrux was useless. MAD. Okay? I AM MAD. Character deaths where they failed are the worst there are.  (hide spoiler)]My Intense and Passionate LOATHES:(Hhahahha...you ready for this?)• Okay so, question: WHY do they sometimes go places and buy food...and sometimes they just magic it? Like Mrs. Weasely magics onion soup out of nothing for Harry. But in the next chapter, Harry and Ron are peeling sprouts. LIKE WUT. This makes no sense to me. • Why didn't Dumbledore pour the evil potion on the ground instead of drinking it? Just wannna know...• How the FLYING FRIKKIN BROOMSTICKS can anyone possibly convince me Snape is still on the good side? Because I don't even care. He can go abra kadabra himself to Timbuktu and DIE THERE THANKS. There is no repentance after this. I don't even care what the ""reason"" is in book 7, but Harry: you are an idiot to name your kid after Snape. • I HOPE SNAPE DIES.• DID I MENTION MY HATE FOR SNAPE YET???????• Oh and another thing...I am so angry at Snape arghhhqqwqq.• Okay. Good now. I'm calm. Thank you. • HAHHAHHAHAHTE SNAPE.• Yes, I truly am calm this time. I'm good.• So. I also am fairly annoyed about Voldermort's (Tom Riddle) backstory. Because he read like he was straight out of a psychopath text book...which I found monstrously unimaginative. Attractive, calm, subtle bully, kleptomaniac, limited emotional reach, charmer, smooth...blah blah. Yes. I can just read a book about psychopaths and that's Voldey's description. I wish there'd been a little more ingenuity in there.• I really also dislike Ron. I KNOW. Travesty. But he's a bully! He was bullying first year's the whole time...turfing tem off chairs, scaring them, bossing them around, taking stuff off them in the name of ""prefect"". Like how is that good?? How is that okay??? I will not forgive Ron for all this. And also the fact that he's a downright BRUTE to Hermione. How can I ship them when he's so rude and demeaning to her?? I DON'T. Hermione deserves better. And I don't buy the ""She completes him by sorting him out"" because I think all humans should take responsibility for their actions. Hermione shouldn't HAVE to force Ron into a better person and be his conscious. AGH. • Not shipping that. ^^• Okay, I'm done. But just *whispers* I hate hate hate Snape. So basically YES, I had a fantastic time with this book. I loved the audio. I loved the story. I loved Harry and the world just feels so big and rich and visual. I get the intense fandom for this I DO GET IT. After being so angry and 1000% done in with book 3, I can successfully say I can't WAIT to read the last book now. And then watch all the movies. And then I'll finally be caught up, omg. Only took me like 10 years."

9644,Why I Write,George Orwell,4.04,5428,479,Matthias,5,"Part 56 in the ""Another autobiographical review that nobody asked for!""-series.Why I ReviewIt was already very late in my boyhood, at thirty years old, when I considered writing book reviews. Being the man of action that I am, which is to say a lazy bum, it was almost to my own surprise that this innocent consideration promptly turned itself into virulent spasms across the keyboard, with my first contributions on Goodreads as the very unfortunate result. Thankfully my friends list at the time only consisted of some imported Facebook contacts who had last been active 5 years prior to my sudden burst of literary enthusiasm and who had gotten too busy climbing up corporate ladders to even remember ever having registered to a website about books, let alone notice what I was doing. Maybe it was this anonymity that allowed me to stay here, because as my own ineptitude was gradually becoming clearer to me as I was reading through others' reviews, I still persisted in forcing myself upon this community and fiendishly sent out friend requests in hopes of learning but mainly in hopes of belonging in this hall of learned ladies and gentlemen. I didn't stop to ponder on these hopes, on my true intentions, my real motivations. I just went with that ""big bang"" moment that seemed to come out of nowhere and I took it from there. I never stopped to ask: Why? George Orwell and his essay on why he writes made me revisit those early days of reviewing and the months (years?) that have transpired since then. I found his considerations relevant to why I am doing what I do, and the structure he employed quite helpful for the organisation of my own scrambled thoughts. Also, it's a very good essay and I rated it five stars, in case you were here for just the review. If you find yourself even remotely interested in reading further through my recollections then I can wholeheartedly recommend George Orwell's original text. Employing Orwell's essay structure, I should start with an understanding of my true nature and with a return to my childhood. Many of you already know that I was a happy, skinny, bespectacled and introverted child with no brothers or sisters and with a wonderful dog. I will not elaborate on that childhood too much since I already did that in other reviews, but these traits do explain a tendency to keep busy with solitary activities. As a child or teenager these activities strangely enough barely entailed reading or writing, aside from comic books and what was required for school. I found reading to be very boring. It felt like watching a movie with subtitles, only without the movie, and much slower. And with the advent of video games I truly had everything my solitary heart desired. The few books I had at that time turned yellow, collected dust and eventually got sold for twenty francs. Fast forward to the internet, with its chat rooms and forums devoted to games and the dominance of the English language in those settings. At a certain point I spent more time on the Internet discussing game strategies rather than playing the games themselves, as I also started commenting on the personal stories and the societal comments people invariably shared on these things. It is now, also through remembering some emails and letters I sent, I realise that it was mainly the writing in itself that I enjoyed, especially in English. All I needed was something worthwhile to write about. Another fast forward to much later to when I finally started reading, also in English. Murakami's ""The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle"" proved to be the perfect present and as I read and finished that one I couldn't wait to start another book and then another and then another. Forget about slow. Forget about ""where are the pictures?"". Finally the movies I always wanted were playing in my mind as I sped through the pages. But after a couple of books a sad realisation gripped me as I asked myself: ""What was the Murakami book about again? Something about a well and melanoma?"". Clearly I had forgotten. I've always been someone who got through life more on the basis of an understanding in the moment rather than a remembering of the past. There are a lot of things to be said for traveling light and taking nothing with you on your travels, but I figured I preferred to try and collect some souvenirs at least. Hence the idea to write reviews. So that's the narrative. But Orwell also comes up with a list of motives, especially when it comes to writing in order to be read, which clearly apply to my case:Sheer egoism""The desire to seem clever.""Check! The immediate feedback-system on Goodreads coupled with its exceedingly generous community makes this motive a potentially overpowering one.Aesthetic enthusiasm""The desire to share an experience which one feels is valuable and ought not to be missed.""Check! Hope you got John McNee's books in your libraries! I think I stressed that enough by now. In the case of reviewing it can also be the opposite of aesthetic enthusiasm, for cases where you would like to dissuade people from ever getting near a certain book. Having seen some negative reviews, those can be pretty enthusiastic as well. Historical impulse""The desire to see things as they are, to find out true facts and store them up for use of posterity.""On the one hand I can't say Check! here because I'm dealing in opinions rather than facts, but on the other hand, as is the case with ""classics"", some general opinions turn into facts and it's nice to either try and debunk them or wholeheartedly defend their status. In essence to see for yourself what all the fuss is about and reach your own conclusions. Moreover the discussions on books and society that often ensue on this website are often very enriching to me and teach me in much the same way a history teacher would, so what the hell: Check!Political purpose""The desire to push the world in a certain direction, to alter people's idea of the kind of society they should strive after.""Dump Trump!, uhh, I mean Check!So there we have it. A ""why"" that has been answered, if not fully, at least partially. A reason for writing that Orwell shortly touched upon as well is ""for a living"". But I think only very few here get compensation in financial terms, not counting gifted books in return for reviews. Unless you guys know something that I don't. In any case, in the end the most important reason lies in the amalgam of all those reasons enumerated above, an amalgam that I can only describe as: I love being here.Just kidding, that's not a reason, that's circular reasoning. But I almost made you tear up, didn't I? It's true though. I do!"

3732,Selected Poems of Herman Melville,Herman Melville,3.9,40,4,Keith,3,"Herman Melville’s poetry is an enigma. The man wrote poetry when he wrote prose. Passages from Moby Dick can be easily laid out in iambic pentameter, with the rich rhythms and imagery you’d expect from a great poet. Yet his poetry proves something else – a bit stiff, slavish to the meter, with cloying rhymes. His mistake, it seems to me, is trying to take his epic, sprawling style and fit it in a tight, lyric format. The short lined lyric doesn’t do him justice, and I don’t think he wrote anything in blank verse – which you would think would be is forte. That said, he wrote some fine poems – the John Marr collection being his best in my opinion. This edition, collected and introduced by Robert Penn Warren, offers an excellent sample of Melville’s poetry, covering poems from his entire life. Warren’s introduction offers one of the best, most comprehensive overviews of Melville’s poetry that you’ll find outside some obscure literary magazine. If you’re interested in Melville and/or his poetry, this is a great starting point.Battle-Pieces *** -- I found this to be a rather strange work. It doesn’t have the vitality or sweep of Whitman’s Drum Taps. Melville struggles to understand the Civil War and its carnage, but his language and ideas seem trapped in metric forms and rhymes. (1/12)Clarel ** – This is a difficult, rambling poem to read and understand. The form cramps Melville’s sprawling style, and the rigid meter is difficult, requiring someone of more skill than Melville (or most writers) possess. (1/12)John Marr and Other Sailors **** – This brief collection is outstanding. Here, Melville adopts a longer line – rhyming but not metrically rigid – that gives him the freedom and space he needs to express himself. The “Sailor Poems” that start the collection are particularly good, though they all have the same story/theme: An old man looking back on his sailing life. Billy Budd probably started as part of this collection, but took on a life of its own and Melville began working on it separately. If anyone is interested in Melville poetry, I’d suggest starting here. (1/12)"

3731,Great Short Works of Herman Melville,Herman Melville,4.05,463,19,James,5,"In the spring of 1853 after the failure of his novel Pierre: Or the Ambiguities and the rejection of his most recent manuscript, The Isle of the Cross (now lost), Herman Melville submitted three stories to Harper's. This was the beginning of period that would see the publication of such great stories as ""Bartley, the Scrivener"", ""Benito Cereno"", ""The Piazza"", and others. It would culminate with his great unfinished novella, Billy Budd, Sailor. All of Melville's tales including Billy Budd are included in this collection from Harper's Perennial Library.By the end of 1853 Melville submits his first story that can be considered not only great but even amazing; this is Bartleby, the Scrivener: A Story of Wall Street. The story amazes in many ways and on many levels. One theme is a world of walls as the narrator, an ""unambitious"" lawyer who prefers the peace of his office to the bustle of the courtroom with judge and jury. He describes himself as ""an eminently safe man"", certainly someone who his clients can trust. The world of his office, located on Wall Street, is one of walls within, separating the scriveners from the lawyer, and walls without since the view from the few windows is limited by the proximity of the walls of the building next door.Into his apparently prosperous business enters Bartleby, a scrivener or clerk, who is hired to handle some additional copying work. Bartleby, as we soon learn, would ""prefer not"" to do any task other than copying and before too long he seems to slowly stop doing any work. He is a ""forlorn"" and sickly character from the beginning (reminiscent of the copyist ""Nemo"", a minor character in Dickens' Bleak House). And his presence gradually requires the narrator to attempt, unsuccessfully, to provoke him so that he might respond in kind. Their worlds clash and in another deeper sense a spiritual realm is entered. The result is a crisis of faith for the lawyer, he thought to himself: ""I might give alms to his body; but his body did not pain him; it was his soul that suffered, and his soul I could not reach."" (p 56)One may interpret Bartleby as a ""Christ-like"" messenger, but what is his message? The variety of themes in the story takes on an objective pathos and parabolic overtones that are almost Dostoievskian in complexity. The story ends with a sort of epilogue that succeeds only in muddying the message further. What makes the story so magnificent is all of the many different possibilities present in it. Just as the narrator has his faith shaken and his perceptions changed by Bartleby, the reader finds his imagination roiled by the possibilities -- the ending merely lays out a choice for the reader. You decide what it all means."

3733,"Redburn, White-Jacket, Moby-Dick",Herman Melville,4.18,942,68,Ken,5,"I'm speechless. OK, maybe a few words. At first I gave this book four stars, but then I looked at other books I'd given five stars to and said, ""Who am I kidding? No way is that in a league with the Whale."" I wanted to chip a star for some of the excess, the stuffed in chapters, the lengthy and in some cases unnecessary asides, but then I slept on it (ouch) and decided I'm using my 21st-century prejudices against a guy operating in the 19th century and that's just not fair.What's to like here is some poetry-studded narrative. Lots of it. And Biblical slash Shakespearean moments galore. The sea is to Capt. Ahab as the heath is to King Lear. And, in the dramatic ending, more than once I heard Ahab addressed as ""Oh Captain, my captain!"" which made me wonder if this preceded Whitman or not. I'm guessing or not and that it's a nod to Walt.I learned a lot about whaling, not much of it pleasant. But it was a great way to deliver information. And I loved all the little extras, the hints of mystery, like how dying whales, tethered to the ship, will turn to the sun and then, when they die, drift so their noses face the opposite direction. It's as if they are beautiful pagans like Queequeg, not facing Mecca but a more primal source, the god of fire. And Melville sees the irony in it, too -- the king of dark, watery vaults worshiping the great hearth of airy fire. Yeah. You can't just make stuff like that up. You've got to pause your reading, reread it, and say, ""Wow"" (or whatever they say in your neck of the woods).Melville is, if nothing else, versatile. He can write an action scene. He can bring to life with a few words a wide array of characters. And he can philosophize in a leviathan way. Big. Yes, I think he was rooting for the Whale, but a part of him loved Ahab, too. A part of him was amazed not just at the hubris but at the dogged determination and blind courage man is capable of. All in all, I'm glad I darned that hole in my reading résumé. Now I can die, meaning this is the literary equivalent of seeing Naples. :-)"

7056,Morality For Beautiful Girls (No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency),Alexander McCall Smith,3.97,32747,1544,Anne Hawn Smith,5,"Reading these books is more like visiting with friends. If you are looking for action and plot, this will not really appeal to you, especially if you have read some of the others. These books are more of a slice of life.This was one of my favorites because of the depression that overcomes Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni. It comes over him so gradually and the people who love him are so concerned for him. I could almost feel myself becoming concerned for him also. Since I suffer from depression from time to time (not just the blues) I found the characterization very good. It's hard to portray how abnormal a person's thinking becomes and Smith does a great job. It's easy to stand on the outside and tell the depressed person to get out and visit friends, but the sick person feels that no one would like to be around him and that he is a burden to his friends; he thinks they would all sigh with relief if he got out of their lives.And that brings up another thing I like about these books. The people are not perfect. They are a combination of the good and the bad and they all struggle to get along in the best way possible. They don't just walk away from each other either."

7058,"The Good Husband of Zebra Drive (No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, #8)",Alexander McCall Smith,4.06,20396,1082,Donna,5,"After quite a few years of living it, I've come to the conclusion that life is made of two things: time and attention. What I love about the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series is the way the author, Alexander McCall Smith, handles both.In The Good Husband of Zebra Drive, as in all the books in the series, the pace is lazy and relaxed. If I ever visit that part of Africa, I expect that I'll recognize the way the sun feels there, the way the dust settles on the roads after a car goes by. The umbrella-like trees and the dignified, enduring cattle will seem familiar. Mma Ramotswe, the central character, notices these things, and I've spent many happy hours gazing at Africa through her eyes.In this book, Mma ponders the mysteries of life and concludes that it is made of big things and small things. The big things, good and bad, are writ large, impossible to ignore. So it's essential to notice and find joy in the small things: ""small acts of helping others, if one could; small ways of making one's own life better: acts of love, acts of tea, acts of laughter.""I recommend this book as a small vacation from life's big concerns. It goes well with an evening of leisure and a nice, hot cup of red bush tea."
7062,Paris to the Moon,Adam Gopnik,3.76,11702,962,Kara,5,"I have to be honest. I bought this book because I liked the title. Then I got sucked in by the back cover. Who doesn't think the idea of running away w/ your adult family to Paris wouldn't be fantastic?Gopnik is excellent at revealing the sutle differences between life in the States and France that make up two completely seperate cultures. I felt upon finishing the book that I actually knew the secrets of French thought and behavior. Unfortunately, I now know exactly why I'd never be able to blend in perfectly - my passion for sneakers would sell me out!Entwined with the journalistic entries of his five years in Paris, Gopnik fills the pages with real life and lots of romance that one hopes for in a story about Paris. And not the couplely type of romance, but the kind that makes it possible to fall in love w/ a city. If I ever get to give my two cents in a European Cities and Culture class, I would make this part of the required reading. My favorite quote from the book because it reveals how culture is prominently defined, even in toddlers:Luke, the Gopnik's 4 yr old son, who has only lived in Paris and as such is more French than American and more French than his parents, says the following to his mother upon seeing Santa buying champagne on Christmas Eve while out for last minutes holiday touches w/ his father. ""We saw Santa at Hediard. I think he was just getting a little cheap wine for the elves.""You could never get even the most precocious American child to say it quite the same way. As if they're worldy and 40 at the age of 4."
7057,"In the Company of Cheerful Ladies (No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, #6)",Alexander McCall Smith,4.07,22518,1008,Laurel,4,"There is something so comforting about this series. Even though life in Botswana is most likely very different than life in Canada, there is something about the tone or writing style that reminds me of life at my grandparent's house. I love the traditional values, the respect for people/property/manners. And most of all, I love that it is important to slow down and really be in the moment with those important to you. I know that the future installments become a little formulaic. However, every so often I am struck by how much I miss my grandparents, and reading one of these books takes the edge off. There is a little magic to these books."
7064,"The Belly of Paris (Les Rougon-Macquart, #3)",Émile Zola,3.9,3016,243,Kalliope,4,"The cover of this novel should come with a warning. Well, may be not even just a warning, for it should be sold with a calorie counter. I am afraid I may have put on several kilos while reading this. Perhaps it would be advisable to read it while running on the treadmill. The lush descriptions of succulent food could well activate and stimulate the production of a peculiar kind of literary enzymes which multiply by ten the energy provided by ingested food if it has been deliciously described.Warnings should go also for the vegetarians. Or the sections dealing with raw meat on display, black pudding, lard and all kinds of sausages, could make them feel disgusted with Zola. These ought to be marked and those who want their cholesterol (the LDL kind) somewhat high would be interested in giving it a pass. The pescetarian types could instead go direct to the Fish pavilion and read and smell the bounty piscary. Zola’s account of the fish counter has the variety and range of an oceanic aquarium. In all shapes and tints. Flesh and Fish then. If these victuals are often presented in opposition Zola exploits this by making it drive some aspects of the novel. For the plot moves along the rivalry between the Butcher and Fishmonger ladies.Other people may prefer to move ahead and read the counter on cheeses and butters over and over again. Never would I have thought that anyone would ever write such an Ode to the Cantals, Gruyères, Bries, Port-Saluts, Roqueforts, Monts-d’Or, Neufchâtels, of this world. Sumptuous and delectable. I certainly belong to that group, and if I could only put one update for this book, it would be this glorious passage. But then, I am a lacto-addict.And even if the book first pays attention to the vegetables, it may be of interest to leave that section to read at the end. I always liked the French custom of eating salad at the end of meals. I don’t know why Zola did not follow this commendable habit here. No matter, his vegetables sparkle like colourful jewels.But not everything is the food. There is history too. Although I have read a fair amount of Zola in the past, for its literary appeal, I was now drawn for its documentary value. And I have not been disappointed. This novel can be read as an intense social, economic and political document.Although published in 1873, when France had installed the Third Republic, the novel is set in the early years of the Second Empire when the population of Paris had doubled in just a few decades. This was the time of the Haussmannization of the city, and amongst other projects, the Central Market of Paris was rebuilt in a structure of glass and steel pavilions to accommodate the provisioning of the city. Balzac had already been fascinated by the logistics required for the supply of food for the daily consumption of Parisians. And Zola followed Balzac’s steps in this too. Reading his Ventre de Paris one feels the compulsion to google all kinds of data relating to Les Halles of Victor Baltard (1805-1974).But what fascinated me the most during this read was Zola’s exploration of the nature of substantiality and his blurring of the borderline separating the human from the material. In some of his descriptions there is a symbiosis between the individual and the corporeality of her/his world that goes beyond anthropomorphism. Inevitably, I had to think of Arcimboldo’s fantasies..For there is something Surreal in Zola’s Naturalism."

Rowling,4.73,26702,909,Jen Holman,5,"I do not own this spiffy box set of Harry Potter books, but no way was I going to sit down and input all 6 of them!! When we were in the UK on our honeymoon in the spring of 2000, Harry Potter fever was just hitting its stride there. Not long after that the books found their way to Canada and I fell in love with this series right from the first book. Again (I'm a broken record) great characters and time-old literary themes, as well as just being a very enjoyable read. I haven't gone to see the movies, because I don't want the characters in my mind replaced with British teen actors and Gary Oldman. (can't stand Gary Oldman.) Fantastic read for any age. Some of my all-time favourite literary characters are from this series, like Dumbledore and Sirius Black. The books get heavier (literally and metaphorically) as the series progresses. The first book is the most child-like, shorter and lighter fare. The last book is downright philosophical and practically qualifies as a doorstop it's so weighty. The HP series is kind of like literary comfort food around here, if there's nothing else to read we'll just grab one and dive in. A definite must-read!"

515,Programming Ruby: The Pragmatic Programmers' Guide,Dave Thomas,4.06,1713,73,Manuel Menezes,5,"If you are an experienced programmer wanting to learn Ruby, this book is for you. A word of warning, though: go take a look at Chapter 27, Metaprogramming. That's the place where the object model of Ruby is explained. Without it, the rest of the book will seem to rely a bit too much on your faith. Unless, of course, you enjoy discovering the truth behind the magic for yourself. I'm sure it is possible and fun, but if you cannot spend the extra time, do take a peek at that chapter.Another warning: the book (or at least it's ebook version) has quite a few typos, especially in Part 4."
5311,The Financial Wisdom of Ebenezer Scrooge: Transforming Your Relationship with Money,Ted Klontz,3.53,60,10,Chavonne,4,"I really enjoyed this book as it interestingly married two loves of mine: financial therapy and Dickens. I think the only thing that led me to not give it a 5 was the lack of money scripts given (I think some readers would struggle with know theirs without a list to work from) as well as its dearth of actual quotes from 'A Christmas Carol'. This book uses the example of Ebenezer Scrooge to really drive home the concept of how one's beliefs (or scripts) about money can dictate their entire existence. I appreciated that this was written by authors with both financial and counseling backgrounds. It's incredibly easy to read, but gives lots of food for thought. It definitely made me look forward to reading the novel this book uses so well in the holiday season as well."
